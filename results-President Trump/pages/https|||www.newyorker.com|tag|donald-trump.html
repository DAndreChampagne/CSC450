On the hundredth anniversary of the end of the First World War, Trump was scheduled to make the short trip from Paris to the site of the Battle of Belleau Wood, which was fought in June, 1918. There were nearly ten thousand American casualties at Belleau Wood, a legendary battle in the history of the Marines. Many of those marines are buried at the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery, where the commemorative ceremony was held. Trump blew it off. It was raining. The President, it was reported, does not like the rain. The grandson of Winston Churchill declared Trump “pathetic.”"],["p","The unwinding accelerates daily.

There is no question: the President is losing what last shred of poise he might have possessed."],["p","It was, from the start, impossible to imagine Trump carrying out the duties of state, practical or ceremonial, with any sense of deliberation or dignity. A little more than two years ago, I went to Arlington National Cemetery to watch President Obama give a memorial address on Veterans Day. It was a brilliant fall day. Thousands of vets and their families had come, as they do every year. It was a distinctly melancholy occasion, and not only because of the surroundings, the heavy fact of having so many war dead around you. Just two days before, Obama had met with Trump, the President-elect—their only one-on-one meeting."],["p","At Arlington, Obama carried a wreath to the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier and then, in a speech at the amphitheatre, he said, “Veterans Day often follows a hard-fought political campaign, an exercise in the free speech and self-government that you fought for. It often lays bare disagreements across our nation. But the American instinct has never been to find isolation in opposite corners. It is to find strength in our common creed, to forge unity from our great diversity, to sustain that strength and unity even when it is hard."],["p","“It’s the example of the single most diverse institution in our country—soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, and coastguardsmen who represent every corner of our country, every shade of humanity, immigrant and native-born, Christian, Muslim, Jew, and nonbeliever alike, all forged into common service.”"],["p","Seventy days remained in Obama’s Presidency. One had to imagine Trump at Arlington and at other solemn moments like it. When Trump took power, his first instinct in office was to divide, to issue the “Muslim ban,” to unleash a toxic cloud of rhetoric intended to undermine what his predecessor had called, at Arlington, “our great diversity.” On Veterans Day, Trump, in all his petulance and lack of understanding of his own office, did what he had done in France. He passed. He did not go to Arlington."],["p","The midterm elections did not suggest at all ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-midterms-mark-a-turning-point-in-the-trump-presidency"},"that Trump is finished"],", that he has no chance to be reëlected and prolong this degrading chapter. He still has the capacity to energize a significant and powerful base of voters. He still holds the Senate; his capacity to deepen his mark on the Supreme Court and on lower courts remains. Trump will surely start devising ways to slime the committee chairpeople in the House, particularly those who are likely to lead investigations into his activities—Maxine Waters, Adam Schiff, Jerrold Nadler, Elijah Cummings—and those who will, after New Year’s Day, start announcing their candidacies for the Presidency. Trump’s ferocity as a campaigner is not to be underestimated, and, sensing his own imperilment, he is bound to campaign with even less consideration for the bounds of decency than he did in 2016 and 2018."],["p","And yet the election results, which continue to accumulate, are not on Trump’s side; his furies make plain that—his declarations of glorious victory to the contrary—he understands this. The Democrats won back at least seven governorships and made serious inroads in state legislatures.They performed well not merely on the coasts but in crucial parts of the Midwest, the Southwest, and even the South. The cities and the suburbs are not with him. The Democrats took at least thirty-four seats back in the House and, of course, flipped the chamber, so that committees will now all be chaired by Democrats. The House Freedom Caucus, which has been so influential, has lost its footing. The voices of women, particularly Democratic women, have been amplified in Congress like never before."],["p","Finally, the elections, over all, made it even more evident than before that the Republican Party has made its pact with a President who is losing support and, in demographic terms, losing the Party’s traditional advantages. The advantages that it continues to hold have less to do with popular support than with the inequities of gerrymandering and the structure of the Senate and Electoral College."],["p","For two years, certain institutions and forces of American life have, imperfectly, fitfully, resisted the autocratic and anti-constitutional instincts of the Trump Administration. Judges, investigators, civil-society organizations, protesters, government officials and ex-government officials in possession of a conscience, and the press have done important work. The election, which nearly everyone understood as a referendum on Donald Trump, has had the most powerful effect of all, and it has led to his current unwinding."],["p","There is no overestimating the damage that Trump has done and will continue to do. He will go on, at best, ignoring the perils of climate change, the evidence of a future that is our present, from the wildfires of California to the swamping of New Orleans, Houston, Puerto Rico, and the state of Florida. He will go on, at best, ignoring the mortal peril of gun violence and the fiscal peril of heedless financial policy. He will go on trying to frighten Americans about “caravans” and “terrorists” infiltrating the country. And he will go on undermining invaluable international institutions and alliances."],["p","But there has always been a case to be made for hope. And the case was made, most powerfully, at the ballot box. When the President fantasizes that the vote was a fraud, the result of criminals dressed in one hat, then another, one shirt, then another—well, that rhetoric of desperation is a signal that maybe, just maybe, a change is on the way."]]],"canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"sections":[{"id":"5904126172dadf5d0a508800","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news","children":[{"id":"5907f159ebe912338a3717d7","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5907f159ebe912338a3717d7","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Daily Comment","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"daily-comment"},{"id":"5904126172dadf5d0a508800","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news"},{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"}],"name":"Daily Comment","parent":[{"id":"5904126172dadf5d0a508800","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"},"slug":"daily-comment"}]}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"web","contributors":[{"name":"David Remnick","type":"author","title":"David Remnick has been editor of \u003cem&gt;The New Yorker\u003c/em&gt; since 1998 and a staff writer since 1992.

On Sunday—a day after Trump, in France with other heads of state to commemorate the centennial of the end of the First World War, ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/trump-completes-a-shameful-trip-to-paris-just-as-he-needs-the-global-stage"},"had declined to visit a cemetery"]," where the American dead lie buried, on account of the rain—Macron made a speech. It was a gesture as clearly directed at and against Trump  as any he could have made, short of having Madame Macron wave a flag with “D.T.” and a diagonal bar across it, “Ghostbusters”-style."],["p","Macron distinguished between nationalism (bad) and patriotism (good), but he did it in eloquent terms. “Patriotism is the exact opposite of nationalism,” he said. “Nationalism is a betrayal of patriotism,” he added, “In saying, ‘Our interests first, whatever happens to the others,’ you erase the most precious thing a nation can have, that which makes it live, that which causes it to be great, and that which is most important: its moral values.”"],["p","To use a long-forgotten Howard Cosellism, I was doubly delighted by the invocation, in part because the same terms had seemed so relevant not long ago in discussing Macron’s great predecessor ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/08/20/how-charles-de-gaulle-rescued-france"},"Charles de Gaulle"],".  He, too, had drawn that distinction, at the risk of his own life. De Gaulle knew that the patriot loves his place and its people and its idiosyncrasies; while the nationalist, of whom, for him, Adolf Hitler was the clearest and worst example, has no particular sense of affection for the place he advocates for (he is often an outsider to it, as Hitler, an Austrian, was to Germany) but channels his obsessive grievances into acts of ethnic vengeance."],["p","It isn’t clear who first made the distinction between nationalism and patriotism. Perhaps it’s one of those observations that rises naturally in several places at once. Certainly, no one has made more of it in his work than ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/trump-and-obama-a-night-to-remember"},"John Lukacs,"]," the American historian of Hungarian origin. Lukacs, in fact, has made it foundational to his understanding of twentieth-century history, with nationalism as the deadly solvent of civilization, and patriotism as its (partially) restorative glue. His heroes, for that reason, are the conservative patriots, ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/never-mind-churchill-clement-attlee-is-a-model-for-these-times"},"Winston Churchill"]," highest among them, along with de Gaulle. (The conservative patriots rate highly in part because the temptation of nationalism on the right is so extreme; the parallel temptation on the left is a blind faith in rational planning, even at enormous human cost.) Trump, of course, declared himself a “",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/news/current/trumps-response-to-the-pittsburgh-synagogue-shooting-and-his-obsession-with-the-word-frankly"},"nationalist"],"” at a campaign rally last month. It was an ugly thing to do, considering the history of the word and who has embraced it, though, as always with Trump, his saving anti-grace is that no one can be sure that he really grasped or understood all the ugliness, and wasn’t just making up ugly on his own."],["p","Historical ignorance is a Trump leitmotif. He started attacking Macron on Friday, just before Air Force One landed in Paris, tweeting, “President Macron of France has just suggested that Europe build its own military in order to protect itself from the U.S., China and Russia. Very insulting, but perhaps Europe should first pay its fair share of ",["em",{"class":"small"},"NATO"],", which the U.S. subsidizes greatly!” Trump returned to the White House on Sunday, skipping the three-day Paris Peace Forum, and on Tuesday morning he resumed his mis-capitalized assault. He tweeted, “Emmanuel Macron suggests building its own army to protect Europe against the U.S., China and Russia. But it was Germany in World Wars One &amp; Two - How did that work out for France? They were starting to learn German in Paris before the U.S. came along. Pay for ",["em",{"class":"small"},"NATO"]," or not!” And then: “On Trade, France makes excellent wine, but so does the U.S. The problem is that France makes it very hard for the U.S. to sell its wines into France, and charges big Tariffs, whereas the U.S. makes it easy for French wines, and charges very small Tariffs. Not fair, must change!” Lastly, he took a few weak shots at Macron’s low approval rating at home before thumbing out “",["em",{"class":"small"},"MAKE FRANCE GREAT AGAIN"],"!”"],["p","So much historical ignorance crowded into so few characters! Macron, in talking of “building his own army,” was actually talking about doing what Trump supposedly wants him to do, i.e., spending more on the military to let Europe protect itself. (This is, in fact, a long-standing French preoccupation; de Gaulle withdrew the French Navy from ",["em",{"class":"small"},"NATO"]," because he didn’t want to be dependent on the Americans, whom he did not completely trust.) The actual logic of the alliance, from an American point of view, was always supposed to be: let’s all pay something, and we’ll pay even more, because it’s cheaper to protect Europe than it is to fight European wars, and that way we have reliable friends. The point of the alliance was to have allies, not shake-down victims. But long-term altruism for long-term benefit is not a concept that Trump can handle."],["p","Indeed, Trump seems incapable of understanding the concept of an alliance at all, much as he does not seem to ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/donald-trump-jeff-sessions-and-the-dangers-of-a-slow-motion-watergate"},"understand the concept of loyalty"],". When he cites someone as a friend, it means that he (usually mistakenly) thinks that the person has adopted a supine position. He’s almost always wrong, as with the case of Kim Jong Un, of North Korea, but it is the limit of his conception of alliances."],["p","The subsidiary ugliness in Trump’s tweets, worth annotating in this memorial moment, is that line about fighting Germany: “How did that work out for France?” That taunt, reflective of Trump’s compulsive need to humiliate anyone whom he suspects of being insufficiently obsequious, is far off the mark. In the ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/first-world-war"},"First World War"],", the Great War, the one that we are commemorating now, the Germans were the ones who regretted having fought the French. Though their casualties were insanely high—nearly a million and a half  troops died—the French fought off the Germans repeatedly and ferociously and ended by winning the war, in alliance—that puzzling word again—with the British and the Americans and, for a time, the Russians."],["p","It was a war hardly worth the winning, to be sure, but that was the final score. In fact, the price of victory was so high that it encouraged the reluctance that helped lame France’s efforts in the next one. (Though expert opinion is coalescing around the idea that it was not French military “cowardice” but the collapse of the governmental classes that led to Vichy.) The lesson of the Great War was that the French would go on fighting past the point of reason, as, indeed, everyone else did, too, thereby providing a better lesson: that there was never a good reason for a great war."],["p","What does that leave? Oh, yes—the wine. The truth, quickly reported on many wine blogs and chat boards, is that E.U. tariffs on American wine are hardly prohibitive—just ",["a",{"href":"https://www.wineinstitute.org/international_trade_policy"},"twelve cents or so a bottle"],". As any American wine drinker in France knows, the absence of good American wines, and there are so many, has more to do with the stubbornness of French taste—with the patriotic taste for the local product—than it does with overpricing. Trump, who bought  what is generally thought to be a ",["a",{"href":"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/12/donald-trump-wines"},"not-great American winery"],", hardly has much room to complain, particularly since winemakers in France are regarded a bit like coal miners are in America, fit subjects for sympathy and protection."],["p","Of course, the French should try more American wines. If Trump wanted to urge that, he might, for once, be on the side of the angels, albeit tipsy ones. The whole point of patriotism, in the end, is that it ought to be an open emotion—one secure enough to make one curious about the country over the hill or across the ocean, and want to find out what their songs and their wine are like.

By U.S. and international law, migrants are allowed to seek asylum “whether or not” they do so at an official checkpoint along the border; Trump’s measure, which was immediately ",["a",{"href":"https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/field_document/ebsc_complaint_final_0.pdf"},"challenged"]," by advocacy groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union, aims to override explicit provisions of an existing federal statute in order to thwart the entry of tens of thousands of Central American migrants. As Lee Gelernt, the A.C.L.U.’s lead litigator in the case, told me, “It would mean the President could literally sit down with a copy of the immigration act that Congress wrote and cross out any provision he didn’t like.”"],["p","The night before the President issued his proclamation, members of the caravan gathered in Mexico City, where they’d paused for a week of rest, to vote on a final destination for the group. Of the big border cities in northern Mexico, Tijuana was considered the safest—the route skirts territory controlled by violent cartels—but it was also the farthest away. The caravan now consists of nearly five thousand people, about a third of whom are under the age of eighteen. An estimated three hundred of them are younger than five. Because of the punishing physical toll of the trip, the group has tried, with mixed success, to arrange van and truck transportation the rest of the way. Hundreds of them have either turned back or have been deported by Mexican authorities, while some twenty-six hundred others, according to the Mexican government, have received temporary legal status to remain in Mexico."],["p","The relative success of the group, coupled with the continued desperation of residents in El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, has prompted a string of smaller caravans, consisting of several hundred people each, to travel in its wake. In recent years, under pressure from President Barack Obama, Mexico has redoubled its efforts to intercept Central Americans heading north, earning its own reputation for aggressive immigration enforcement. At the same time, the U.S. has invested about seven hundred million dollars in an aid package, called the Alliance for Prosperity, to try to address the corruption and rampant crime that are seen as the root causes of emigration from the region. “The caravans are not the problem,” Tonatiuh Guillén López, the incoming head of Mexico’s National Migration Institute, ",["a",{"href":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/border-baja-california/sd-me-mexico-immigration-20181111-story.html"},"said this week"],". “The issue is the movements we do not see, those who are not in the caravan, that is the big issue.”"],["p","For months, the Trump Administration, which has repeatedly threatened to cut foreign aid to Central America as a form of political punishment, has tried to negotiate a special arrangement with the Mexican government. Known as a “safe third country agreement,” it would, among other things, allow the U.S. to automatically send Central American asylum seekers who travel through Mexico back over the border to pursue their immigration cases there. A similar pact exists between the U.S. and Canada, premised on the idea that immigrants have a fair shot at pursuing asylum in the ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-trump-administration-is-completely-unraveling-the-us-asylum-system"},"American system"],". Anyone travelling through the U.S. who arrives at an official Canadian checkpoint to request asylum is turned over to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. The White House has promised to rescind its asylum ban if Mexico signs a similar deal with the U.S. But, for logistical and humanitarian reasons, this is a non-starter for the Mexicans."],["p","Although migration to the U.S. is still significantly lower than it was two decades ago, the number of people applying for asylum is on the rise, and hard-liners in the Trump Administration claim, ",["a",{"href":"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/adolfoflores/trump-says-released-migrants-miss-their-court-hearings"},"in the face of conflicting evidence"],", that families are gaming the system by entering the country to pursue asylum and then disappearing before their immigration cases come before a judge. “This enrages the Miller cabal,” a former Trump Administration official told me, referring to the President’s senior adviser Stephen Miller. “Miller knows there’s only so much the U.S. can do without changing or limiting those who can claim asylum.” For the past several months, in open violation of international law, Customs and Border Protection has been turning away asylum seekers at official ports of entry, from San Diego to McAllen, Texas, claiming that migrants would have to wait in Mexico until there was enough space to process them. Meanwhile, the President’s proclamation last week lacked any commitment to increase resources at ports of entry to deal with the heightened traffic, and earlier this week C.B.P. issued a warning that there would be further delays. In effect, while the Administration claimed to only be targeting those who enter the U.S. illegally, it was, in multiple ways, trying to shut down the southern border for everyone. Another former Trump Administration official told me, “They really don’t have any more tools beyond just tightening the screws: separate families, eliminate asylum and due process, turn back people at the border.”"],["p","On Monday afternoon, a group of seventy-seven Hondurans who’d been travelling with the caravan for the past month arrived in Tijuana, ahead of the larger group. Cesar Mejía, a twenty-three-year-old from San Pedro Sula, with a chin-strap beard and blond highlights in his close-cropped hair, had become, by accident, a de facto leader of a group of L.G.B.T.Q. migrants who formed their own unit within the caravan. When Mejía crossed into Guatemala, in mid-October, he displayed a gay-pride flag that he had stashed in his backpack. “I just left a country where I was discriminated against,” he told me. “I used to get attacked, and I’d go to the police to lodge complaints, but nothing ever happened. When I took out the flag on the caravan, people asked me what country it was from, and I told them, ‘It’s the flag of the world.’ ” In Mexico City, a representative from the advocacy organization ",["em",{"class":"small"},"RAICES"]," offered to help connect Mejía and other L.G.B.T.Q. travellers with lawyers as they neared the border. U.S. detention facilities can be dangerous, particularly for queer and transgender migrants, and a network of American advocacy groups are now on the ground in Tijuana in anticipation of the caravan’s arrival."],["p","“Trump scared us,” Mejía told me. “But we got to Tijuana, and it wasn’t like what Trump said on TV.” The border was ",["em","limpia"],", he told me—by which he meant, free of American troops. As part of a dramatic, preëlection gambit, the President sent fifty-six hundred soldiers to south Texas, hundreds of miles from where the caravan was headed. Since then, the soldiers had very ",["a",{"href":"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/10/us/deployed-inside-the-united-states-the-military-waits-for-the-migrant-caravan.html"},"little to do"]," other than set up a patchwork of wire fencing along the border."],["p","Even if the route to Tijuana is comparatively safe—and the border with San Diego clear of infantry soldiers—the city itself poses a number of dangers for migrants trying to enter the U.S. “There are over a thousand asylum seekers waiting at the port of entry right now,” Nicole Ramos, the director of the Border Rights Project at Al Otro Lado, an immigrant-advocacy group, told me on Monday. “When the caravan arrives, we’re going to be in a real crisis.” Since 2015, Ramos has been collecting testimony from people turned away at the border into San Diego because officials with the C.B.P. claimed the U.S. has reached its capacity for processing asylum seekers. Under Trump, she told me, the situation has worsened, with migrants now waiting as long as four to six weeks to present their asylum claims to immigration agents. In the meantime, the streets and shelters in Tijuana, many of which are in close proximity to cartel houses and smugglers’ dens, have grown overcrowded; the local police and federal soldiers patrolling the city are notoriously corrupt as well. The migrants, Ramos told me, are “sitting ducks.” Blocking  ports of entry, she added, “is creating its own lawlessness, and it’s forced people to try to cross who then get penalized” for bypassing the ports of entry."],["p","Mejía had just arrived in Tijuana when we spoke on Monday, but he was clear-eyed about his own prospects. A group of lawyers were advising him about when, exactly, he should report to the port of entry, and he was prepared for delays. “If we have to wait a while, fine,” he told me. “For people like me who don’t have the money to pay a smuggler to come to the U.S., the caravan is what we have. This has been our option. We don’t have to pay, but we have to suffer. And we’ve been through so much already, why not wait a little longer.”"]]],"canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"sections":[{"id":"5904126172dadf5d0a508800","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news","children":[{"id":"590a02541c7a8e33fb390be1","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"590a02541c7a8e33fb390be1","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News Desk","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news-desk"},{"id":"5904126172dadf5d0a508800","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news"},{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"}],"name":"News Desk","parent":[{"id":"5904126172dadf5d0a508800","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"},"slug":"news-desk"}]}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"web","contributors":[{"name":"Jonathan Blitzer","type":"author","title":"Jonathan Blitzer is a staff writer at \u003cem&gt;The New Yorker\u003c/em&gt;.","email":"","bio":["div",["p","Jonathan Blitzer is a staff writer at ",["em","The New Yorker"],".

Saturday’s edition of the *Wall Street Journal* contained two scoops unrelated to Tuesday’s vote. The lead story revealed that federal prosecutors in New York have found evidence that, in the run-up to the 2016 election, [Donald Trump](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump) “intervened directly to suppress stories about his alleged sexual encounters with women,” including the adult film actress Stormy Daniels and the former Playboy model Karen McDougal, contradicting his claims that he didn’t know anything about the payoffs the women received. According to the *Journal* [story](https://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trump-played-central-role-in-hush-payoffs-to-stormy-daniels-and-karen-mcdougal-1541786601), Michael Cohen, Trump’s former personal lawyer and fixer, has told the Feds that, shortly before the election, he conferred with the President about payments to Daniels, and Trump told him to “get it done.” The *Journal* story also reveals that, in 2015, Trump asked David Pecker, the chief executive of the company that owns the *National Enquirer*, what he could do to help his campaign, and that Pecker offered to use the *Enquirer* “to buy the silence of women if they tried to publicize alleged sexual encounters with Trump.” This allegation raises the possibility that Trump may have committed campaign-finance violations, although the story makes clear that such a case would not be a slam dunk. One law professor told the *Journal* that a “criminal conviction would require proof Mr. Trump willfully skirted legal prohibitions on contributions from companies or from individuals in excess of $2,700.” \n\nOf course, there is little chance of the Justice Department bringing any charges against the President, especially now that it is in the hands of a Trump loyalist, Matthew Whitaker, who was the chief of staff to the previous Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, until Trump fired him on Wednesday, the day after the midterms. Whitaker’s appointment as the acting Attorney General has produced a firestorm of criticism, and the *Journal’s* [second scoop](https://www.wsj.com/articles/fbi-is-investigating-florida-company-where-whitaker-was-advisory-board-member-1541799564) will only add to the controversy. The paper reported that the F.B.I. is investigating a Florida company, World Patent Marketing, that is accused of bilking customers of millions of dollars during a period in which Whitaker served on the firm’s advisory board and vouched for its honesty. World Patent Marketing shut down last year after the Federal Trade Commission claimed it “charged would-be inventors thousands of dollars to patent and promote their inventions, but provided almost no real services and threatened those who complained,” the *Journal* story said. As well as serving on the firm’s advisory board, Whitaker appeared in at least two of its promotional videos, and said in a press release, “As a former U.S. Attorney, I would only align myself with a first class organization.” \n\nA spokeswoman for the Justice Department told the *Journal* that Whitaker “has said he is not aware of any fraudulent activity. Any stories suggesting otherwise are false.” But that won’t stem the controversy surrounding the acting Attorney General, which, until this latest story, had centered on whether his appointment was legal, and whether he should be forced to recuse himself from supervising the investigation being carried out by the special counsel, Robert Mueller. Before he took the job as chief of staff to Sessions, Whitaker publicly criticized some aspects of the Mueller investigation. He also stated badly that there was no evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. Critics, myself included, have suggested that Whitaker’s appointment appears to be a blatant effort by Trump to influence the end game of the Mueller probe. In an effort to dismiss this line of criticism, Trump on Friday claimed, “I don’t know Matt Whitaker.” But that’s not what he told his pals at Fox News just a month ago. As the *Times* [reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/09/us/politics/matthew-whitaker-donald-trump.html), he said then, “I can tell you Matt Whitaker’s a great guy. I mean, I know Matt Whitaker.”\n\nThe pressure on Whitaker appears to be building. On Saturday, the Washington *Post* ran [an editorial](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/there-is-no-way-this-man-should-be-running-the-justice-department/2018/11/09/f4a2ee60-e45e-11e8-8f5f-a55347f48762_story.html) headlined “There is no way this man should be running the Justice Department.” In addition to referring Whitaker’s comments about Mueller and his ties to the deeply dubious Florida company, the *Post* article pointed out that the acting Attorney General has expounded some crackpot views about the Constitution, including calling into question Justice John Marshall’s famous ruling in the 1803 Marbury v. Madison case, which asserted that the Supreme Court has the ultimate power to interpret the Constitution. “If the Senate were consulted, it is impossible to imagine Mr. Whitaker getting close to the attorney general’s office,” the editorial concluded. “He should not be there now.” \n\nMeanwhile, a recount in Florida is underway in the races for the governor, the senator, and the agriculture commissioner. And the counting of votes from the midterms continues in a number of key races, including the Senate race in Arizona and Georgia. Right now, the final outcome of these contests is far from clear. In Arizona, on Friday night, election officials [said](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/in-arizona-senate-race-democrat-takes-narrow-lead-over-republican-as-vote-count-continues/2018/11/09/c27ae76c-e418-11e8-b759-3d88a5ce9e19_story.html) that the Democrat Kyrsten Sinema, who was trailing in the Senate race after Election Night, had now widened her lead over the Republican Martha McSally to more than twenty thousand votes. And, in Georgia, the gubernatorial campaign of the Democrat Stacey Abrams is refusing to concede defeat, even though the Republican Brian Kemp has claimed victory and has announced his transition team. \n\nAs the level of acrimony increases, Republicans—with the backing of the President—are accusing Democrats, without any firm basis, of trying to steal elections. Although the details of these hotly contested elections differ from place to place, the common element is that some votes are still being processed, which is not uncommon in American elections. With a lot of early voting, postal voting, and provisional ballots to deal with in some districts, getting all the votes in and tallied is no simple matter. “&amp;nbsp;‘Why are these people taking so long to count votes??’ you ask, implying something nefarious,” the Cook Report’s David Wasserman [wrote on Twitter](https://twitter.com/Redistrict/status/1061039444042661889) on Friday. “Answer: they always take this long to count, you just never GAF b/c it wasn’t a close election.” \n\nIn Arizona, for example, hundreds of thousands of votes remained to be counted as the weekend arrived. An [analysis](https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/11/08/how-many-votes-left-count-martha-mcsally-kyrsten-sinema-senate-race-maricopa-county/1934817002/) by the Arizona *Republic* revealed that, in Maricopa County alone, which includes the city of Phoenix, these uncounted votes included “150,000 early ballots received before Election Day and 195,000 ballots that were either early ballots dropped off on Election Day, provisional ballots, or out-of-precinct ballots cast on Election Day.” Part of the issue is the large turnout. The newspaper projected that about 2.18 million people would vote in the Arizona Senate race, a very high number for a midterm election. But the actual turnout appears to have been about 2.4 million, which is the highest in the state’s history.  \n\nThe President should be welcoming a high turnout as an indication of the health of American democracy. Instead, he is trying to whip things up. In a tweet on Friday, he wrote, “Just out — in Arizona, *SIGNATURES DON’T MATCH*{:.small}. Electoral corruption - Call for a new Election? We must protect our Democracy!” Of course, Trump didn’t provide any backing to support his claim: so far, there doesn’t appear to be any. In response to the inflammatory tweet, the Republican Senator Jeff Flake, who is vacating the seat that McSally and Sinema are contesting, [responded](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/11/09/trump-arizona-senate-election-981676), also on Twitter, “There is no evidence of ‘electoral corruption’ in Arizona, Mr. President. Thousands of dedicated Arizonans work in a non-partisan fashion every election cycle to ensure that every vote is counted. We appreciate their service.” \n\nIn Florida, the phony controversy is centered on the counties of Broward and Palm Beach, which both lean Democratic. Rick Scott, the former governor, has accused Nelson and the Democrats of trying to steal the election, which he was leading by a broader margin on Tuesday night., After Scott asked the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to investigate, his lawyers went to court. So far, these efforts have achieved mixed results. On Friday, a spokesperson for the Department of Law Enforcement rebuffed Scott, saying there had been no credible allegations of voter fraud. However, a state judge did order election officials in Broward and Palm Beach to release some information to Scott's campaign about how the ballots were being counted, [the Miami *Herald* reported](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/article221459090.html). \n\nThe irony of all this is that the very election officials whom Scott is attacking may have done him a great service in designing the election ballot for Broward County in a way that indirectly favored him. On the paper ballot, the box for the Senate race was buried below a bunch of instructions in the bottom left-hand corner, which made it hard to see. In a useful primer on what’s going on in Florida, FiveThirtyEight’s Nathaniel Rakich [pointed out](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/something-looks-weird-in-broward-county-heres-what-we-know-about-a-possible-florida-recount/) that this may be the reason why, in Broward, the number of votes cast in the Senate race was 26,060 votes fewer than in the race for governor, the box for which was prominently displayed at the top of the ballot. Since Broward is heavily Democratic, anything that reduced the size of the voter turnout there was helpful to Scott. In an extremely tight race, it’s even conceivable that this “undervote” could have tipped the race in the Republican candidate’s favor.\n\nWhatever happens in Arizona and Florida won’t tip the balance of power in the Senate. The Republicans are guaranteed fifty-one seats, and they will almost certainly add another one by winning a runoff in Mississippi. But, if the Democrats were to pick up Arizona, and maybe even eke out a hold in Florida, it would further qualify the outcome of the Senate contest, which initially looked like a blowout for the Republicans and for Trump, as Democratic incumbents suffered substantial defeats in Indiana, Missouri, and North Dakota. Right now, the Democrats have forty-six seats on the [*Times* electoral map](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/11/06/us/elections/results-senate-elections.html), but they could possibly get up to forty-eight. \n\nOn the House side, too, the news for Democrats is getting better as time goes on. Early Wednesday, it looked like the Party had made a net gain of about twenty-six seats, barely more than it needed for a majority. The net-gain number has now risen to thirty-one, and it could well rise a bit further as some tight races in California are finally settled. So far, the Democrats have picked up two seats in the Golden State, which is fewer than they had been hoping for. But they are narrowly ahead in two races that haven’t been called—one in the San Joaquin Valley and the other in Orange County. What’s taking so long? Again, it looks like process rather than perfidy is responsible. In California, most ballots are cast by mail. Many of them aren’t mailed until Election Day, and they don’t arrive at the polling stations until a day or two later. This influx of late votes usually favors the Democrats, the Los Angeles *Times’* Mark Barabak [explained](http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-me-pol-midterm-california-ballots-20181109-story.html), because “typically older white Californians who begin mailing their ballots weeks before election day, lean Republican. Democratic voters, many of them young and minority, prefer to vote in person or mail their ballots in later.” Thus their votes get counted later. As they say: it ain’t over until it’s over.

Like a tree rotting from the roots, it’s a lengthy decay that only becomes fully visible when it is well advanced. And even at that late stage, parts of the tree can appear to be verdant and vigorous.\n\nThe healthy part of U.S. democracy was on display on Tuesday, when tens of millions of Americans defied the country’s shamelessly antiquated election infrastructure to register their votes. Although both parties emerged with things to cheer about, the biggest story of the election was the Democratic takeover of the House of Representatives. But even as votes were still being counted in some close races on Wednesday, there was another clear signal of the sickness that is eating away at the American system from the inside. \n\nOfficially, the rushed departure from the Justice Department of Attorney General Jeff Sessions was described as a “resignation.” Of course, it was really a firing. In fact, it was tantamount to a double firing. In appointing Sessions’s interim replacement, [Matthew Whitaker](https://www.newyorker.com/news/swamp-chronicles/matthew-whitaker-the-new-acting-attorney-general-absurd-argument-to-rein-in-robert-mueller-trump), a conservative Republican lawyer who had been serving as Sessions’s chief of staff, [President Trump](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump) passed over the Justice Department’s second-in-command, Rod Rosenstein, and also stripped Rosenstein of responsibility for overseeing the investigation being carried out by [Robert Mueller](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/robert-mueller), the special counsel. \n\nIn a statement released on Thursday, the Justice Department said, “The Acting Attorney General”—meaning Whitaker—“is in charge of all matters under the purview of the Department of Justice.” That includes the Russia investigation. Without actually firing Rosenstein, an independent figure who has been a strong defender of Mueller, Trump has accomplished the same thing that a dismissal would have brought about: the appointment of a more loyal, and perhaps more pliable, figure to oversee the final stages of Mueller’s work.\n\nEveryone in Washington knows that Trump has been itching to fire Sessions since March of 2017, when the former Alabama senator recused himself from overseeing the Russia investigation. In July, 2017, Trump [told](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/19/us/politics/trump-interview-sessions-russia.html) the *Times*, “If he was going to recuse himself he should have told me before he took the job, and I would have picked someone else.” With the midterms safely out of the way, Trump contained himself no longer. \n\nUnlike many of Trump’s appointees, Sessions hadn’t become enmeshed in ethical scandals, and he couldn’t be faulted for failing to support the President’s agenda. Under his leadership, as he pointed out in his forced [resignation letter](https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/07/politics/sessions-resignation-letter/index.html), the Justice Department helped beef up immigration enforcement, targeted transnational drug gangs, and “prosecuted the largest number of violent offenders and firearm defendants in our country’s history.” Session’s firing offense was to have failed to protect Trump adequately from the Russia investigation—a fact about which the President has made no secret. \n\nTo be clear, forcing out the Attorney General without any proper cause was a disgraceful departure from precedent. But in the scheme of things it was less of a threat to the rule of law than the sidelining of Rosenstein and the appointment of Whitaker, who is on record as having expressed concerns about the scope of the special counsel’s inquiries. That was the real banana-republic move, and its intent couldn’t have been clearer. “This is a frontal assault on the Mueller investigation,” Susan Hennessey, the executive editor of the Lawfare blog, [wrote](https://twitter.com/Susan_Hennessey/status/1060262109202841600) on Twitter. “Trump sees a window and he’s taking it.”\n\nIn an [interview](https://thinkprogress.org/matthew-whitaker-mueller-russia-investigation-5d1b62e74b6b/) with CNN last year, before he joined the Administration, Whitaker raised concerns about reports that Mueller’s team was looking into the finances of the Trump Organization. “We cannot have unfettered prosecutors overturning every rock that [is] unrelated to any, like, nexus to the underlying issues, which is Russian coordination in the 2016 election,” he said. He also raised the possibility of Trump firing Sessions and appointing a replacement who “doesn’t fire Bob Mueller, but he just reduces his budget to so low that his investigation grinds to almost a halt.”\n\nWhat is needed is a public assurance from Whitaker that he will leave the supervision of the Mueller investigation to Rosenstein, which is what a number of Democrats were asking for on Wednesday when they called on Whitaker to recuse himself from the matter. At the very least, Whitaker should immediately issue a statement pledging to uphold the independence of the Justice Department, to support Mueller, and to allow him to complete his inquiries unimpeded. \n\nBut there are grounds to doubt that such a statement would be believable or enforceable—one of which is that Whitaker was Trump’s pick, or at least Trump approved his appointment. It seems unlikely that the President did so without giving careful consideration to what Whitaker would do if he got the promotion.\n\nOn the plus side, some observers believe that the Mueller inquiry has already proceeded far enough that it would be difficult for anybody to sabotage it. “To ‘shut down’ the investigation at this point would require not just a face-off with Mr. Mueller but also with special agents in charge of multiple field offices with a vested interest in seeing their responsibilities through, and possibly even a battle with the F.B.I. director, Christopher Wray,” Asha Rangappa, a former F.B.I. counterintelligence agent, [wrote](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/09/opinion/rod-rosenstein-trump-robert-mueller-russia.html) in the *Times* last month. (Indeed, on Thursday morning, anonymous sources told [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/08/politics/trump-reviewing-answers-mueller/index.html) that Mueller’s team has already begun drafting its final report.)\n\nOther legal experts take a far less reassuring view. A few weeks ago, in a piece about the role that Rosenstein has played in protecting Mueller, Hennessey and her  Lawfare colleague Benjamin Wittes [wrote](https://www.lawfareblog.com/how-rod-rosenstein-protects-mueller-investigation), “What kind of mischief could be made by someone hostile to the Mueller probe and seeking to protect the president and his allies? The short answer is a whole lot.”\n\nAlthough the special-counsel statute grants Mueller a good deal of independence, he is obliged to keep the Attorney General (or acting Attorney General) informed about major developments, such as decisions to bring criminal charges. As Hennessey and Wittes point out, the regulations say that the Attorney General “may after review conclude that the action is so inappropriate or unwarranted under established Departmental practices that it should not be pursued.” The Attorney General also has the authority to fire the special counsel “for cause,” and he can also help determine what happens to any concluding report that the special counsel files to the department. Conceivably, Whitaker could try to bury it.\n\nSo far, only a few Republicans have expressed disquiet about the firing of Sessions and the sidelining of Rosenstein. “I’m concerned Rod Rosenstein will no longer be overseeing the probe,” Senator Susan Collins [wrote](https://twitter.com/SenatorCollins/status/1060294357079810054), on Twitter. “Special Counsel Mueller must be allowed to complete his work without interference—regardless of who is AG.” Senator Lamar Alexander also [issued](https://twitter.com/SenAlexander/status/1060302335350595584) a statement, saying that Mueller must be allowed to complete his investigation, as did [Mitt Romney](https://twitter.com/MittRomney/status/1060296443611598848), the former Republican Presidential candidate who is now the senator-elect from Utah.\n\nThis wasn’t nearly enough. The President does not care about precedent or the principle that everybody, including the occupant of the Oval Office, should be treated as equal under the law. If Republicans are serious about protecting Mueller, there is a simple way for them to show it. They can support [a piece of legislation](https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/with-gop-divided-senate-panel-takes-up-legislation-to-protect-mueller/2018/04/26/83518316-4954-11e8-827e-190efaf1f1ee_story.html) that would make it difficult, or impossible, for Trump or Whitaker to fire the special counsel. Earlier this year, the Senate Judiciary Committee advanced a bipartisan bill of this nature, but Mitch McConnell, the Majority Leader, prevented it from going any further. As recently as September, McConnell [said](https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/28/politics/jeff-sessions-mcconnell/index.html) that he believed Sessions “ought to stay exactly where he is.” Now Trump has axed Sessions and replaced him with a loyalist. On Wednesday, McConnell stayed conspicuously silent.","rubric":"","socialTitle":"Trump’s Effort to Hobble the Mueller Investigation Must Be Stopped","socialDescription":"The President has installed a more loyal, and perhaps more pliable, figure to oversee the final stages of the Russia inquiry.","seoTitle":"Trump’s Effort to Hobble the Mueller Investigation Must Be Stopped","seoDescription":"John Cassidy writes about the firing of Attorney General Jeff Sessions by President Trump, and the future of Robert Mueller’s investigation.","channel":"","subChannel":"","issueDate":"","ledeCaption":"","contentSource":"web","canonicalUrl":"","contentType":"","textMimeType":"","tags":["Jeff Sessions","Mueller Investigation","Department of Justice","Rod Rosenstein","Russia","Donald Trump"],"interactiveOverride":"","revisionAuthor":"Nathan Burstein","meta":{"collectionName":"articles","modelName":"article","publishable":true,"identifiable":true,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":true,"hierarchical":false},"id":"5be43d88fbe7fb2ced6a94ad","revision":30,"createdAt":"2018-11-08T13:43:36.088Z","modifiedAt":"2018-11-08T16:51:13.388Z","revisionCreatedAt":"2018-11-08T16:51:13.388Z","_embedded":{"contributorsAuthor":[{"fields":{"name":"John Cassidy","title":"John Cassidy has been a staff writer at _The New Yorker_ since 1995.

How, the President wondered, was he supposed to feel about the midterm electoral defeat of so many moderate and suburban Republicans? “I’m not sure that I should be happy or sad,” he said. True, their loss had cost his party control of the House. On the other hand, as he saw it, many of them had never been demonstrative enough in showing their loyalty to him or in asking for his help; they didn’t “want the embrace.” They should have known that without Trump they were nothing. And so, on balance, he said, “I feel just fine about it.”\n\nWhether the President is happy or sad has become the central, if not the sole, concern of the Republican Party and of his Cabinet. A few hours after the press conference, Attorney General Jeff Sessions was finally forced to resign, yet, even in his resignation letter, he pleaded to be understood as an ideological loyalist, praising the President for his focus on the “rule of law.” Sessions was indeed a true Trumpist, particularly when it came to immigration policy. The White House’s announcement, on Thursday, that it was severely restricting asylum claims could almost be seen as an act of spite—denying Sessions the chance to preside over the demolition of a system he had so eagerly undermined.\n\nSessions’s one misstep was to recuse himself from oversight of Robert Mueller’s investigation into possible Russian interference in the 2016 election. Trump believes that it’s the Attorney General’s job to protect the President from such annoyances. By most accounts, the man he has named acting Attorney General, Matthew Whitaker, believes so, too. When a reporter asked Trump if Whitaker would “rein in Robert Mueller,” he replied only, “What a stupid question.” Perhaps, to him, the answer was obvious.\n\nOne of the more dangerous outcomes of the midterms is the belief, in some quarters of the G.O.P., that putting the Party in Trump’s hands was worth it. Three of the Democratic senators whom he personally campaigned against—Joe Donnelly, in Indiana; Claire McCaskill, in Missouri; and Heidi Heitkamp, in North Dakota—lost. “He worked very hard, drew large crowds, and I think it clearly had a positive impact,” Mitch McConnell, who will remain the Senate Majority Leader, said, apparently untroubled by the bigotry, the lies, and the fear-mongering that Trump had used as he worked up those crowds. McConnell also warned against “Presidential harassment”—a phrase that, in the Trump era, could describe many things, but by which he meant the Democrats’ using control of the House to investigate Trump.\n\nDespite Trump’s description of the midterm results as “close to complete victory,” there were some notable setbacks for his party, especially at the state level, with a net loss of at least six governorships and more than two hundred legislative seats. Some of the Republican House members who won’t be returning in January, including the twenty-three who chose to retire, would likely agree that they might have been able to keep their seats if they had embraced Trump, but they just could not or would not make that bargain. Others stayed away for a pragmatic reason: Trump was deeply unpopular in their districts. The President said that Barbara Comstock, the incumbent in Virginia’s Tenth District, was among those who had forfeited a win by not aligning herself with him. In fact, she lost to an opponent, Jennifer Wexton, who had labelled her “Barbara Trumpstock.” Trump’s kind of Republican would have bragged about how great that sounded.\n\nYet Trump is right in one respect. The midterms _were_ a party-building exercise, if all one was trying to build is the Party of Trump. The G.O.P. is acclimating itself to accepting divisiveness and unconstitutional travesties—including, perhaps, efforts to end birthright citizenship—in return for a few Senate seats. Worse, more and more Republicans elected under Trump’s auspices, such as Josh Hawley, of Missouri, and Marsha Blackburn, of Tennessee, don’t even see their association with him as a trade-off. They like what the President stands for and seem to regard being loyal to him and keeping him happy as natural parts of the job.\n\nThe same appears true of Whitaker. A former federal prosecutor who was, until last week, Sessions’s chief of staff, Whitaker is, in many ways, a walking distillation of Trumpism. He has spoken of the border as being “under assault” and of the need for “New Testament” judges; and, in an echo of his new boss’s flimflammery, he was recently involved in a questionable invention-marketing operation. (“Anybody that works for me, they do a number on them,” Trump said on Friday. He added, “I don’t know Matt Whitaker”—a reminder that Trumpist loyalty goes only one way.) Whitaker has already announced that there never was any collusion with Russia: last year, in a column for CNN, he wrote that Mueller was headed for “witch hunt” territory.\n\nNevertheless, instead of recusing himself, as Sessions did, Whitaker has taken control of Mueller’s investigation; even if he doesn’t fire the special counsel, he could try to veto subpoenas that Mueller’s team might want to serve on the President or on members of his family. Mueller has apparently begun writing his final report; efforts by the Administration to scuttle any indictments could easily escalate into obstruction of justice. According to the _Times_, by last Thursday congressional Democrats, who are anticipating the subpoena power that the chairmanship of House committees will give them, had held a conference call to map out ways to protect Mueller—or to jump into the fight themselves.\n\nThe firing of Sessions is an illustration of how the President’s demand for loyalty brings the country ever closer to a constitutional crisis. Whitaker has said that the list of Supreme Court decisions that he thinks are wrong begins with Marbury v. Madison—the landmark 1803 case that delineated the Court’s power to interpret the Constitution, and which is woven into almost every aspect of American jurisprudence. If the Court doesn’t decide what’s constitutional, who does? Trump?\n\nOn Friday, meanwhile, the President headed to Paris for a centennial commemoration of the end of the First World War. The trip gives him a chance to brag to other leaders about his midterm victory and, he no doubt expects, to accept their congratulations, their thanks, and their embrace. ♦","hed":"Party of One","issueDate":"November 19, 2018","tags":["Donald Trump","2018 Midterm Elections","Jeff Sessions","Mueller Investigation","Republican Party","Matthew Whitaker","category_news","Congress","Senate","Democratic Party","_page_numbers:17-18","_xmlfilename:181119taco_talk_sorkin"],"contentSource":"magazine","meta":{"collectionName":"articles","modelName":"article","publishable":true,"identifiable":true,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":true,"hierarchical":false},"dek":"","channel":"","subChannel":"","seoTitle":"The Post-Midterms Dangers of Donald Trump","seoDescription":"In firing the Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, the President is bringing the country closer to a constitutional crisis.

But, it is striking that, when he did, their prime task seemed to be to support Trump.","body":"-=-=-=-\n\nIn Georgia, on Sunday, when he still had four more rallies to attend before the [midterms](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/midterms-2018)—in Tennessee that day, and in Ohio, Indiana, and Missouri on Monday—President [Donald Trump](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump) told a story that summed up much of what he seems to think he is getting in return for the time he has spent on the road. Maybe it was a fairy tale. It began, Trump said, when he was backstage, and encountered  “a very, very powerful guy—big, strong guy—with tears coming down in his face.” The big man said, “ ‘Thank you, Mr. President, for saving our country.’&amp;nbsp;” According to Trump, “This happens all the time. *This happens* *all the time*. ‘Thank you.’ Tears! Tears!” Trump drew two fingers downward  in front of his cheeks, and continued, “I said, ‘When was the last time you cried?’ He said, ‘I don’t know that I ever cried.’ Even as a baby this guy didn’t cry. But he was crying backstage. I mean, tears are coming down, thanking me. And it’s true! We turned the country around. The country was going down.” Another hand gesture: a whirl, like water going down the drain, or the signal at the end of a magic trick.\n\nDid it happen just that way? Does it happen all the time? It is hard to know if that matters to Trump, compared with his essential message: rallies are a time for gratitude, for paying homage. For the crowds, that is perhaps supposed to be empowering and enthralling; they, with their presence, get to be called “very, very powerful.” In the final rally on Monday night, in Missouri, Trump summoned his daughter to the stage (“Ivanka, say a few words—come, honey”) and, with a trilling laugh, she said, “Hi, Missouri! We love you, we love you! So much love!” There were also appearances by Rush Limbaugh (“These rallies!” Limbaugh, a native of Cape Girardeau, Missouri, where the rally was held, told the crowd, as it swung toward a chant of “Lock her up”); Sean Hannity and Jeanine Pirro, of Fox News (a dose of celebrity, and a reminder of the network’s supportive function); Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary; and Kellyanne Conway. As Ivanka walked offstage, Trump riffed on the idea of élites. “I know all the élites. They’re not very smart, in many cases. They have a lot of hatred in their heart,” he told the crowd, and then continued, “We have better houses, homes, boats. We do better than they do, we work harder than they do, we make more money than they do. You—we—are the *super élites*.”\n\n+++inset-right\n\n[#externallink: /externallinks/5be214806cc2dd2d8635b6d8]||||||\n\n+++\n\nWho are “they”—who aren’t very smart, who hate, who don’t have nice houses—supposed to be? At each rally, Trump talked about “the mob” that hated America, and the Democrats who led it. In Missouri, he said that Senator Claire McCaskill, a Democrat who is widely recognized as a moderate, would push a “horrible socialist agenda.” In Ohio, he said, of Richard Cordray, the Democratic candidate for governor and the former head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, “This guy Cordray is a bad guy, not a good person; he’s hurt a lot of people; what he’s done to people is a disgrace.” (The source of Trump’s bitter invective is, apparently, Cordray’s association with Senator Elizabeth Warren.) In Georgia, he said that the election of Stacey Abrams as governor would mean agents coming door to door to seize each household’s guns. He added, “You put Stacey in there and you’re going to have Georgia turn into Venezuela.” In Tennessee, he said, “They want to impose socialism on our country. And they want to erase America’s borders. Democrats want to invite caravan after caravan of illegal aliens to pour into our country. I don’t think so!” \n\nHe continued, pointing to the cameras at the back of the room, “I don't care what *they* say. I don’t care what the fake media says. That’s an invasion of our country!” He was interrupted by a chant of “Build that wall! Build that wall!” before continuing, “If you want more caravans and more crime—because crime comes with it—vote for the Democrats!”\n\nAt rally after rally, Trump talked about how electing the Democrats would turn Georgia or Tennessee or Missouri or the whole country into “a giant sanctuary city” to shelter, as he put it in Georgia, “predators,” or, as he said in Indiana, where he was appearing to support Mike Braun in his effort to defeat Senator Joe Donnelly, one of the most vulnerable Democrats, “drug dealers, gang members, MS-13 killers.” And, at stop after stop, he talked about how the Democrats were supposedly inducing immigrants to come with offers of “free welfare”; what he meant by that is anyone’s guess. \n\nThe Democrats want to welcome immigrants for their own insidious reasons, Trump said.  “They want them to vote. ‘Come on in and vote!’ They love them voting,” he said in Tennessee. This idea was like a drumbeat. It contained both the notion of a demographic shift and of phantom voter fraud. Trump has no hesitation about ginning up bigotry or conspiratorial fears that the electoral system has been compromised. “Most of all, they want them to vote,” he said in Indiana, adding, “There’s only one way to stop this assault on American sovereignty. You have to vote tomorrow. You have to!”\n\nThe ostensible point of all of these rallies is to help Republicans keep control of Congress and to win some key governorships, which, because of the state governments’ role in drawing districts, could help to win future Congresses. He closed the rally tour in Missouri and Indiana, because the Senate races there are, essentially, tossups. Part of the reason the Democrats are at risk—Trump, at least, seem to think so—is that McCaskill and Donnelly, as he put it, “joined the Democrat mob in voting against [Justice Kavanaugh](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/brett-kavanaugh).” In McCaskill’s case, he said, “Just like she didn’t vote for Judge Kavanaugh, she’s not going to vote for us. And that’s the way it is.” \n\n+++inset-right\n[#externallink: /externallinks/5be0c97c6cc2dd2d8635b3d4]||||||\n+++\n\n\nAs the rallies progressed, Trump’s rhetoric about Brett Kavanaugh got more extreme. In Georgia, he mentioned that a woman on the far margins of the story, who had claimed to be the author of an anonymous letter accusing Kavanaugh of rape, had admitted that she had never known him at all, calling her “No. 4,” and wondering what else said about Kavanaugh might be proved false. (Kavanaugh has denied all the accusations against him.) By the time Trump got to Missouri, she had become “*the* accuser,” and the news was that “it was a scam; it was all fake.” He said, of Kavanaugh, “He hung in there. And I hung in there, too, by they way. I hung in there. False accusations, false accusations!”\n\nBy Wednesday morning, we’ll know better who all this helped and who it hurt. Trump did give the Republicans he was supporting some time onstage. But it is striking that, when he did, their prime task seemed to be to support Trump. Both Marsha Blackburn, the Republican nominee for the U.S. Senate in Tennessee, and Brian Kemp, who is running against Abrams in Georgia, thanked the crowds for voting for the President. At each rally, Trump pointed out the Republican office holders in the audience—there was always a small crowd of them. Their presence, and their applause for Trump, served to validate him—to show anyone watching that the honor he was afforded was just and right. (Similarly, when Trump talked about the economy—he tended to frame it in ways that communicated how he, personally, was praised for its progress, with vignettes about foreign leaders and “kings and queens and princes” who had purportedly expressed their wonder and admiration.) The point of the rallies, after all, is Trump, which is another way of saying that the point is the 2020 election.\n\n“He has delivered for this state!” Josh Hawley, who is running against McCaskill, said, at the Missouri rally. Hawley’s case for himself consisted of a list of times McCaskill had voted against Trump’s interests, or was “just like Hillary,” or had “mocked” the President. Hawley would never do that. “We’re going to reëlect him!” Hawley said. “Four more years!” the crowd chanted, as a man who was still hoping for six in the Senate nodded, clapped, and looked, with a smile, toward the President.","rubric":"","socialTitle":"Donald Trump’s Final, Bitter Midterm Rallies","socialDescription":"The President gave the Republicans he was supporting some time onstage.

A white clerk tells him that he will first have to read aloud a paragraph from the Constitution. When he easily does so, the clerk says that he will also have to read and translate a section written in Spanish. Again he complies. The clerk then demands that he read sections in French, German, and Russian, all of which he happens to speak fluently. Finally, the clerk shows him a passage in Arabic. The professor looks at it and says, “My Arabic is rusty, but I believe this translates to ‘Negroes cannot vote in this county.’ ”\n\nOld jokes have lately been finding renewed salience. Literacy tests, poll taxes, and grandfather clauses, once the most common mechanisms for disadvantaging minority voters, have been consigned to the history books, but one need look no further than the governor’s race in Georgia to see their modern equivalents in action. The race between the Republican, Brian Kemp, Georgia’s secretary of state, and the Democrat, Stacey Abrams, the former minority leader of the state House of Representatives—who, if she wins, will be the first black female governor in the country—is a virtual tie. But Kemp has invoked the so-called exact-match law to suspend fifty-three thousand voter-registration applications, for infractions as minor as a hyphen missing from a surname. African-Americans make up thirty-two per cent of the state’s population, but they represent nearly seventy per cent of the suspended applications. Kemp’s move is particularly questionable given that Abrams’s electoral strategy hinges on mobilizing the six hundred thousand unregistered black voters who have long been seen as the holy grail of Democratic politics in the state.\n\nKemp’s acts are singled out for scrutiny in “One Person, No Vote,” a book about modern-day voter suppression, by the historian Carol Anderson. In 2012, after the Asian American Legal Advocacy Center, in Atlanta, discovered that many of its clients who were naturalized citizens were not on the voter rolls, despite having registered, the group raised the issue with Kemp’s office. “In a show of raw intimidation,” Anderson writes, “Kemp ordered an investigation questioning the methods that the organization had used to register new voters.” In 2014, Kemp investigated the New Georgia Project, a voter-registration initiative that Abrams had founded. In a similar vein, officials in Jefferson County last week ordered a group of African-American senior citizens off a bus taking them to an early-voting site, on the ground that the transportation, which had been organized by the nonpartisan group Black Voters Matter, was a “political activity.”\n\nThe events in Georgia are part of a broader political project. The xenophobia and the resentment that Donald Trump stirred up during the 2016 election are fundamentally concerns about the future of the American electorate. (His reported comment that too many people are immigrating from “shithole countries” in Africa and the Caribbean was paired with a lament that not enough are coming from Europe.) He has repeatedly stated that he lost the popular vote because non-citizens voted for Hillary Clinton. Last Thursday, at a rally in Montana, he suggested that Democrats were responsible for a caravan of migrants now heading north from Honduras, because they “figure everybody coming in is going to vote Democrat.” Kemp, likewise, claimed that Abrams wants to let undocumented people vote in Georgia. The suppression of minority votes is the homegrown corollary of this strategy—an attempt to place a white thumb on the demographic scale.\n\nAccording to the Brennan Center for Justice, ninety-nine bills designed to diminish voter access were introduced last year in thirty-one state legislatures. Many of the recent Republican-led efforts stem from the Supreme Court’s 2013 decision in Shelby v. Holder. In an opinion that eviscerated the Voting Rights Act of 1965, Chief Justice John Roberts wrote that discrimination still exists, but not sufficiently to warrant the “extraordinary” remediation measures that the act imposed on the states of the former Confederacy. That argument is roughly equivalent to saying that a decline in the prevalence of an infectious disease means that we should stop vaccinating against it. Within hours of the decision, Texas announced a strict new voter-I.D. law. Mississippi and Alabama shortly afterward began enforcing similar laws that previously had been barred.\n\nThe decision added a layer of severity to a voter-access crisis precipitated by state laws that prohibit six million Americans with past convictions from voting. In three Southern states—Florida, Tennessee, and Kentucky—this means that at least twenty per cent of eligible-age African-Americans cannot vote. Meanwhile, North Carolina enacted restrictions on early voting, a policy that particularly affects African-Americans, who are likely to be hourly-wage workers and cannot always get to the polls on Election Day. Last year, the Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal to reinstate a voter-I.D. law in North Carolina that a federal court had found targeted black voters “with almost surgical precision.” In effect, the question posed by Roberts’s ruling is how much discrimination there has to be before you can justify protecting voters.\n\nIronically, though, a number of the recent laws validate Roberts’s argument about the undue burden that the Voting Rights Act put on the South; complaints have been lodged in several states that fought for the Union, such as Ohio, Wisconsin, Indiana, and Iowa, which have passed strict voter-I.D. or roll-purge laws. Earlier this year, in Kansas, a federal judge struck down a law that required voters to provide proof of citizenship to register, championed by Kris Kobach, the secretary of state, who served as a vice-chair of Donald Trump’s short-lived voter-fraud commission and is now running for governor. In North Dakota, which didn’t become a state until twenty-four years after the Civil War, Native Americans must now provide an I.D. that shows a street address—even though many have only a P.O. box.\n\nThe midterm elections are in two weeks. The results will be read as a referendum primarily on Trump’s Presidency, but also on the effectiveness of the electoral restrictions. The old punch line has changed: a professor fluent in five languages no longer need travel south to encounter voter suppression. Voter access is not just a regional crisis; it is a national one. ♦","hed":"Not Every Vote Counts","issueDate":"October 29, 2018","tags":["Voting","Georgia","Brian Kemp","African-Americans","Voting Rights","Voter Suppression","category_news","\"One Person, One Vote\"","Carol Anderson","Asian American Legal Advocacy Center","New Georgia Project","Black Votes Matter","Shelby v.

single political party is troublesome when expressed by reactionaries, but an outrageous one when expressed by a black Chicagoan who ought to know better.","body":"-=-=-=-\n\nSince its inception as a gauche, reality-TV-worthy lark, [Donald Trump](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump)’s political career has trafficked—profitably—in spectacle. The risqué language of his rhetoric, the belligerent fervor of the campaign rallies that he holds even two years after the election, the malign charisma that he exudes—all this was in pursuit of a cynical principle that he has organized his life and, now, the nation’s politics around. Selfless service is no longer the most esteemed virtue of democracy; celebrity is. It’s for this reason that the image of a *MAGA*{: .small}-hatted Kanye West, seated, on Thursday, in front of the Resolute Desk and blacksplaining the evils of the Democratic Party, while Trump nodded along, felt less surreal than it should have. Rather, it seemed a logical turn of events in a cosmos capable of granting Donald Trump [three hundred and four votes](https://transition.fec.gov/pubrec/fe2016/federalelections2016.pdf#page=11) in the Electoral College. Surrealism only works when there is a stable reference for reality.\n\nAs part of a ten-minute logorrhea jaunt in the Oval Office, West oddly admitted that he saw Trump as a reference point for his own masculinity, and that he derived superpowers from his red Make America Great Again hat. To the extent that it matters—and, in the marketplace of spectacle, it does not matter much—West is not a conservative; he’s a contrarian. (The same can be said of Trump.) An actual commitment to conservatism would require more stringently analytical or, at least, consistent thinking than West has demonstrated since he started his *MAGA*{: .small} spree, earlier this year. It’s not uncommon for men unburdened by rigorous thinking but convinced of the superiority of their intellects to presume that a minority opinion is the most valid one. As they see it, a rarity among men must certainly hold the least common of world views. It is not uncommon for people to support Donald Trump, as the rallies that he presides over indicate. But it *is* uncommon for black men, eighty-two per cent of whom voted for Hillary Clinton, to support him. It is safe to assume that Trump’s support among middle-aged rappers is at least as meagre. This conflation of élitism with unpopular ideas is a trait that Trump and West share. Trump’s most absurd and wrongheaded ideas, from birtherism to trade protectionism, are connected by the fact that they were thought to be ridiculous by people whom he sees as his intellectual inferiors—not, like him, a genius. \n\nThe Trump Presidency is an animate example of what happens when the term “for argument’s sake” becomes an actual political ideology. Trump’s élitist contrarianism has been able to masquerade as conservatism, in part, because it exists explicitly in opposition to everything that the liberal Barack Obama stood for. Trump is not a Republican; he’s whatever is the opposite of a black Democrat who became President. This is why Trump was no doubt particularly gratified to hear West, a once favored son of Chicago, the city that gave Obama his political foundations, mouthing the right-wing talking point that violence in Chicago is a product of the Democratic Party’s failures. Homicide, West said, is a product of the Democratic welfare state, which destroyed black families. It’s worth pointing out that Trump has consistently drafted black celebrities—not elected officials, scholars, or policy analysts—into his discussions of African-American interests. (The N.F.L.-great-turned-activist Jim Brown accompanied West to the White House for what was supposed to have been a discussion of economic development, policing, and public policy.)\n\nThe discussion of Chicago, or, rather, the Chicago that is the fictive jungle of Trump’s pronouncements, illustrates precisely why it is dangerous to substitute impulse and connotation for thought and analysis. For Trump, Chicago exists as a central reference point for black failure. During the 2016 campaign, he politicized the [death of Nykea Aldridge](https://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/294239-wade-trumps-tweet-left-a-bad-taste-in-my-mouth), the cousin of the N.B.A. star Dwyane Wade, tweeting that her shooting, on the South Side of Chicago, was further evidence that black people would “vote Trump.” Shortly after taking office, Trump tweeted, “If Chicago doesn't fix the horrible ‘carnage’ going on,&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. I will send in the Feds!”—a threat that connoted less a concern about black lives than the partisan opportunities provided by conspicuous black deaths.\n\nAt the Oval Office meeting on Thursday, Trump advocated for the use of stop-and-frisk in Chicago (which, to his credit, West asked him to reconsider), despite the fact that the police department there has been plagued by complaints of excessive use of force, and that, less than a week earlier, the former C.P.D. officer Jason Van Dyke was [convicted of second-degree murder](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/laquanmcdonald/ct-jason-vandyke-laquan-mcdonald-timeline-htmlstory.html) in the shooting death of the seventeen-year-old Laquan McDonald. Trump’s own Attorney General has opposed the federal consent decree that was designed to address the problems in the department. For Trump, the violence in Chicago serves as the perpetual justification for these kinds of abuses. The belief that the violence is the product of a single political party is troublesome when expressed by reactionaries, but an outrageous one when expressed by a black Chicagoan who really ought to know better.\n\nThe roots of Chicago’s violence are complex and trans-partisan, but they exist in the context of a prolifically armed and exceedingly violent country. (White American violence alone would distinguish the United States from its less volatile Western industrial peers.) There is no way to segregate the six hundred and sixty-four murders that took place in Chicago last year from the more than seventeen thousand that occurred in the rest of the United States. The catalysts for violence in that city predate the “welfare state” and the rise of single-parent black households, in the nineteen-seventies. In the classic 1945 text “[Black Metropolis](https://www.amazon.com/Black-Metropolis-Study-Negro-Northern/dp/0226162346)*,*” the sociologists St. Clair Drake and Horace Cayton detailed the ways in which discrimination in housing and employment were negatively affecting black migrants. Twenty-three years before that, the Chicago Commission on Race Relations, formed after a race riot in which thirty-eight people died, found the violence to be a product of the exploding populations in the city’s Black Belt and the poor housing and employment conditions to which the growing number of African-Americans were subjected. (In 1903, W. E. B. Du Bois had lamented the ways in which overcrowding, filth, and discrimination, as well as unchecked vice, had spawned violence within the emerging black communities in Philadelphia.) \n\nTo understand Chicago, we could turn to Richard Wright, whose early work documented the travails of black migrants there. Or to the photographer Gordon Parks, who began his career depicting the living conditions of African-Americans in Chicago. Or to the artist Charles White, whose early work explored similar themes. Or to the poet Gwendolyn Brooks, whose work provided a window into the lives of black Chicagoans. Or to the playwright Lorraine Hansberry, whose “[A Raisin in the Sun](https://www.amazon.com/Raisin-Sun-Modern-Classics/dp/0413762408)” was partly inspired by her own family’s fight against racially restrictive housing covenants in the Chicago area. At one time, it would have been possible to turn to Kanye West for insight into such matters. \n\nBut you cannot turn to Donald Trump to understand Chicago, because you would then be trading presumptions instead of ideas, and putting empty placeholders where reflection and analysis belong—a known formula for idiocy. And if, by chance, one finds oneself, like Kanye, engaged in such clownery with the President of the United States, it should be recalled that idiocy is the one exception in life where it is always better to be useless than to be damned by one’s usefulness. ","rubric":"","socialTitle":"Kanye West, Donald Trump, and the Truth About Chicago","socialDescription":"The belief that the violence in Chicago is the product of a single political party is troublesome when expressed by reactionaries, but an outrageous one when expressed by a black Chicagoan who ought to know better.","seoTitle":"Kanye West, Donald Trump, and the Truth About Chicago","seoDescription":"Jelani Cobb writes about the rapper Kanye West’s visit to President Donald Trump in the White House and the perpetuation of the erroneous assumption that the city of Chicago owes its problem of violence to the creation by the Democratic Party of a welfare state in the city.","channel":"","subChannel":"","issueDate":"","ledeCaption":"","contentSource":"web","canonicalUrl":"","contentType":"","textMimeType":"","tags":["Donald Trump","Kanye West","Chicago","Violence","Racial Profiling"],"interactiveOverride":"","revisionAuthor":"Carlos Colomer","meta":{"collectionName":"articles","modelName":"article","publishable":true,"identifiable":true,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":true,"hierarchical":false},"id":"5bc2244dd942102d81c0f6db","revision":12,"createdAt":"2018-10-13T16:58:53.597Z","modifiedAt":"2018-10-13T23:57:40.080Z","revisionCreatedAt":"2018-10-13T23:57:40.080Z","_embedded":{"contributorsAuthor":[{"fields":{"name":"Jelani Cobb","title":"Jelani Cobb is a staff writer at *The New Yorker* and the author of “[The Substance of Hope: Barack Obama and the Paradox of Progress](https://www.amazon.com/dp/080271739X/?tag=thneyo0f-20).”","email":"","socialMedia":[{"network":"Twitter","handle":"jelani9"}],"canonicalUrl":"http://www.newyorker.com/contributors/jelani-cobb","bio":"Jelani Cobb has been contributing to _The New Yorker_ since 2012, and became a staff writer in 2015.

But a fuller copy of the e-mail correspondence between Ramirez’s legal team and Republican and Democratic Senate staffers shows that a Republican aide declined to proceed with telephone calls and instead repeatedly demanded that Ramirez produce additional evidence in written form. Only then could any conversation about her testimony proceed. The exchange culminated in a breakdown of communication between the two sides, as Republican and Democratic staffers traded accusations of stonewalling.\n\nThe e-mails show that Mike Davis, a senior Republican committee staffer, approached Ramirez’s attorneys on Sunday evening, shortly after *The New Yorker* published a piece about Senate Democrats investigating her [allegation of sexual misconduct by Kavanaugh during their college years](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/senate-democrats-investigate-a-new-allegation-of-sexual-misconduct-from-the-supreme-court-nominee-brett-kavanaughs-college-years-deborah-ramirez). Ramirez told *The New Yorker* that Kavanaugh had exposed himself at a drunken dormitory party, thrust his penis in her face, and caused her to touch it without her consent as she pushed him away. Kavanaugh has repeatedly said that the allegations are false. \n\nFrom the start, Ramirez’s legal team had called for the F.B.I. to conduct an investigation. Her attorney John Clune told Davis that Ramirez was seeking an F.B.I. investigation and said that, “on appropriate terms, she would also agree to be interviewed in person.” But when Clune proposed a phone call several times, Davis repeatedly insisted that Clune answer two questions: Did Ramirez possess evidence in addition to what was in the *New Yorker* article? And was she willing to provide testimony to the committee’s investigators?\n\nClune answered the Republican staffer’s questions, suggesting that Ramirez did, in fact, have additional witnesses and other evidence. And, he said, of Ramirez’s willingness to testify to the committee’s investigators, “We couldn’t answer without learning more from you about the details of whatever process you are contemplating. After hearing more, we would advise the client accordingly.” Davis then requested that Ramirez’s team provide evidence in the form of a letter, e-mail, or statement to the committee’s investigators before he would consider a call. Clune continued to try to schedule a call with a Democratic staffer on the e-mail thread, but Davis wrote back to him, saying that, “before we discuss a phone call or any other next steps, again, we need to have the following information,” and reiterated the two questions. \n\nAt that point, Heather Sawyer, the Democratic staffer who was copied on the e-mails in accordance with committee policy, wrote to Davis, “As you’re aware, Ms. Ramirez’s counsel have repeatedly requested to speak with the Committee, on a bipartisan basis, to determine how to proceed. You refused. I’ve never encountered an instance where the Committee has refused even to speak with an individual or counsel. I am perplexed as to why this is happening here, except that it seems designed to ensure that the Majority can falsely claim that Ms. Ramirez and her lawyers refused to cooperate. That simply is not true.”\n\nDavis responded, “I have not refused to speak with anyone. I am simply requesting – for the __7th time__ now __over the last 48 hours__ – that Ms. Ramirez’s attorneys provide the Senate Judiciary Committee with any __*evidence*{:.underline}__ that they have before we move to the next steps.” (Emphasis in original.) Finally, one of Ramirez’s lawyers sent a formal letter requesting an F.B.I. investigation. The letter said that Ramirez “is willing to cooperate with the Committee,” and that her efforts to do so were being rebuffed. \n\nSawyer did not respond to a request for comment. A Democratic staffer responding on her behalf confirmed that the e-mails were accurate. \n\nDavis did not comment, but he provided a separate personal e-mail sent to one of Ramirez’s attorneys, noting that they were acquaintances and saying, “I look forward to working with you on this matter.” In a statement, a Republican committee aide said, “Our staff proactively reached out to Ms. Ramirez’s attorney just minutes after she went public in the New Yorker, and we did so on a bipartisan basis. As a general practice, the committee requests to review any evidence or statement before determining how best to proceed with an investigation. This is necessary given the sheer volume of claims that the committee receives. Our staff asked on seven separate occasions over the course of 48 hours for any evidence or statement Ms. Ramirez would be willing to provide. Unfortunately, her counsels have not provided the committee with any such material to review.” The aide noted that the committee asked Kavanaugh about the allegation during an interview this week. \n\nRamirez’s attorney, Clune, disputed that description of the committee’s response, saying in a statement that he had responded “quickly and positively” to each of the committee’s inquiries. “Almost immediately in our correspondence, they became less interested in hearing from her and more interested in discovering what witnesses we could bring forward. Since it was only the majority staff that made these demands, as the minority staff questioned those demands as unprecedented, we became suspicious that any disclosures we might file would be shared inappropriately with Judge Kavanaugh or others to prepare and attack Debbie’s account,” Clune wrote. “Since Debbie’s interest was in an F.B.I. investigation where Judge Kavanaugh could be questioned under oath, we didn’t feel comfortable releasing this information without their assurances. We continued to attempt to negotiate in good faith by submitting a lengthier letter providing more information as well as Debbie’s request for investigation. Other than replying ‘received’ on Thursday morning, the committee has not responded. It is remarkable that the committee admits they had enough information to question Judge Kavanaugh under oath on Debbie’s statements in *The New Yorker*, yet that very same information was insufficient for Debbie’s counsel to earn even a phone call.” \n\nFord’s road to testifying was also marked by partisan rancor and allegations of stonewalling by both sides. In an e-mail last week, Ford’s attorney Debra Katz wrote to the committee’s majority staff, saying, “The imposition of aggressive and artificial deadlines regarding the date and conditions of any hearing has created tremendous and unwarranted anxiety and stress on Dr. Ford.” In announcing Ford’s agreement to testify after days of tense exchanges, Katz wrote that “many aspects” of the terms under which she would testify “are fundamentally inconsistent with the Committee’s promise of a fair, impartial investigation into her allegations, and we are disappointed with the leaks and the bullying that have tainted the process.” \n\nBefore Ford testified, Republicans on the Judiciary Committee announced that a vote on Kavanaugh would proceed on Friday. After yesterday’s hearing, Grassley told reporters that the committee would meet on Friday morning for the vote, as planned.\n\n\n\n----------\n\n\n*E-mails exchanged between Ramirez’s legal team and Republican and Democratic Senate staffers obtained by The New Yorker have been reproduced below.

will be down one billionaire but have more clout than ever.","promoDek":"","body":"-=-=-=-\n\n\nThe retirement of David Koch from Koch Industries will make it easier to see more clearly what has been true from the start: Charles and David Koch, who came to be known as “the Koch brothers,” were equals in bloodlines and in wealth, but Charles has always been the brains behind the brothers’ vast corporate and political operations. Those who know the brothers well predict that David’s retirement will have scant impact, particularly in the political realm, where the Kochs exert enormous influence.\n\nFor the past four decades they have tapped their vast fortune from a hundred-and-fifteen-billion-dollar-a-year family business, Koch Industries, to finance a private political machine whose reach and size have been described as rivalling that of the Republican Party. By lavishly underwriting candidates, policy organizations, and advocacy groups—often [through untraceable donations](https://www.newyorker.com/sections/news/can-time-inc-survive-the-kochs)—they have pulled American politics toward their own arch-conservative, pro-business, anti-tax, and anti-regulatory agenda, particularly in the environmental area. Although David Koch is also stepping down from his role as chairman of the Americans for Prosperity Foundation, the foundation wing of the Kochs’ main political-advocacy group, their influence isn’t likely to wane anytime soon.\n\nDavid Koch, who is seventy-eight and the wealthiest resident of Manhattan, is more socially prominent than his older brother. He is often chronicled on the social pages, having donated by his own estimate $1\\.2 billion to philanthropic causes, including many of New York City’s cultural, medical, and educational institutions, several of which bear his name. In contrast, Charles Koch, an eighty-two-year-old libertarian ideologue who continues to live in the brothers’ home town of Wichita, Kansas, has largely stayed outside of the limelight. But those familiar with the brothers suggest that although Charles is less well-known, he, not David, has long been the driving force behind both the phenomenal growth at Koch Industries and the duo’s ambitious political ventures.\n\nCharles also appears to have dominated David’s decision to retire. According to two well-informed individuals close to the family, David, who has been in declining health for several years, had resisted resigning, but Charles forced him out. A business associate who declined to be identified, in order not to jeopardize his ties to the family, told me, “Charles pushed David out. It was done with a wink, and a nod, and a nudge.” A second longtime family associate confirmed this, saying, “Charles had been pushing him out for quite some time. David kept resisting. It was bad. Charles took control.” \n\nThe decision became public on Tuesday, when Charles, who is the chairman and chief executive officer of Koch Industries, sent a letter to employees announcing that David would be retiring as vice-president, a development that he attributed to David’s deteriorating health. “We are deeply saddened by this, as we miss David’s insightful questions and his many contributions to Koch Industries,” Charles’s letter said. The letter didn’t disclose the nature of David’s health problems, but he was diagnosed with prostate cancer twenty-four years ago. Multiple associates say that in the past year or so he had visibly declined, losing weight and losing his train of thought in conversations, as well as occasionally nodding off in meetings and public events. “As a result,” the letter said, “he is unable to be involved in business and other organizational activities.” Charles Koch, meanwhile, continues to work through the weekends, often arriving at Koch Industries’ Wichita headquarters earlier than many other employees. “He’s a workaholic, like Warren Buffett. He lives to work,” the well-informed business associate told me. “It looks like he’s going to be doing this into his nineties.”\n\nIt is unclear, however, what will become of David’s ownership of nearly half of Koch Industries, the second-largest private company in the country, which began as oil refineries and pipelines, and has grown into a multinational conglomerate encompassing lumber, paper, chemicals, coal, fertilizer, and sophisticated financial-trading operations. Because the company is private, there is minimal transparency. But Charles and David Koch reportedly own virtually all of its stock, splitting the shares equally among themselves and plowing most of the profits back into the company. *Forbes* magazine estimates that each brother is worth approximately sixty billion dollars, tying them as America’s ninth-richest men. Steve Lombardo, Koch Industries’ chief of corporate communications, did not respond to questions about who would exercise control of David’s shares, should he prove unable to function. David has three children, the oldest of whom is college-aged. Charles has two children, including a son, Chase Koch, who has assumed a growing role in running the company.\n\nThe Kochs’ future prospects are of public interest because of the oversized influence they have exerted in American politics. Beginning in the late nineteen-seventies, the brothers became the primary underwriters of hard-line libertarianism in the country. From the start, though, Charles was the instigator behind their political activism while remaining largely behind the scenes. This dynamic was evident as far back as 1980, when Charles convinced his younger brother David to run for Vice-President on the Libertarian Party ticket. The brothers regarded Ronald Reagan, who was running for President that year, as too liberal. The Libertarian platform called for abolishing all federal income taxes and virtually every federal agency, including the I.R.S., the F.B.I., the C.I.A., the F.E.C., the E.P.A., the F.D.A., and the S.E.C. The party also opposed Medicaid, Medicare, Social Security, public education, and minimum-wage and child-labor laws. Charles and David, former  members of the John Birch Society, which their father, Fred, helped found, regarded centralized government as a scourge akin to Communism. At the time, however, such views were considered kooky even by most conservatives. The conservative stalwart William F. Buckley, Jr., called the Kochs’ views “Anarcho-Totalitarianism.” The voters’ verdict was equally harsh. David spent two million dollars of his own money on his candidacy in 1980, but he was trounced. The Libertarian Party earned only one per cent of the vote.\n\nAfterward, Charles told a reporter that he had grown disillusioned with conventional electoral politics but had not given up his quest to advance libertarianism. “Politics,” he told a reporter, “tends to be a nasty, corrupting business.” His interest, he said, is “in advancing libertarian ideas.” Instead of just funding candidates, Charles set out to subsidize an ideology. He aimed to change the way Americans thought by creating and funding an interlocking array of libertarian think tanks, advocacy groups, and academic, legal, and other organizations. Even two years before his brother’s Presidential run, Charles declared, “Our movement must destroy the prevalent statist paradigm.”\n\nNearly forty years later, many of the Kochs’ policy preferences are now standard Republican orthodoxy, having been promoted from the fringes into the mainstream by the dozens of nonprofit organizations and candidates they funded. Small government, anti-tax, anti-regulatory, and pro-privatization policies, as well as skepticism regarding global warming, are commonplace. \n\nAfter his 1980 bid for office, David Koch continued to be the more visible of the brothers. He spoke at Americans for Prosperity events and made head-turning political donations. But most of the planning for the Kochs’ political takeover was done by Charles Koch, various sources close to the process told me. It was Charles Koch, for instance, who came up with the idea, in 2003, of pooling political donations with like-minded wealthy conservatives, creating a huge, centrally controlled war chest for what is, in essence, a conservative millionaires’ movement. There are now some seven hundred members of this exclusive club, which meets twice a year at Charles’s invitation and calls itself the Seminar Network. Each member commits to donate a minimum of a hundred thousand dollars, and some donate millions. “David liked to rub shoulders with the other big donors, and to make large donations,” the well-informed business associate told me, “and so that part may now change. But Charles really runs the bus. Only when Charles goes will everything change.”\n\nThe election of Donald Trump, the single Republican Presidential candidate whom they had openly opposed, seemed to some to sideline the brothers. Charles had memorably described the choice between Trump and Hillary Clinton as like one between “cancer or a heart attack.” But while the Kochs didn’t get the candidate they wanted, under Trump they have nonetheless gotten many of the policies they wanted. Political allies, many of whom have have been subsidized by the Kochs in one way or another in the past, now fill numerous key Trump Cabinet and administrative posts.  \n\nAt the E.P.A. and the Interior Department, for instance, two government agencies that are vital to the profit levels of Koch Industries, top personnel have deep ties to the Kochs. The career of the E.P.A. administrator, Scott Pruitt, in Oklahoma politics was financially supported by the Kochs. Daniel Jorjani, now the acting solicitor in the Interior Department, formerly worked for Freedom Partners, the Kochs’ political-funding group, and at the Charles Koch Institute and Charles Koch Foundation. Dozens of other key Koch-affiliated personnel encircle Trump, including Marc Short, the congressional liaison in the Trump White House; Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who received backing from the Kochs  as a businessman and a congressman from Wichita; Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, who was a billionaire donor in the Kochs’ Seminar Network; and Vice-President Mike Pence, whose financial ties to the Kochs run so deep, the former Trump White House strategist Steve Bannon told me, that he worried that if Pence were ever elected “he’d be a President that the Kochs would own.”\n\nRecent news accounts have highlighted differences that the Kochs have had with Trump, including their plans to spend heavily against Trump’s imposition of tariffs on imports, and their opposition to Trump’s restrictive immigration policies. Some cite these fissures as evidence  that the Kochs are changing or moderating their views. Frank Baxter, a longtime donor to the Kochs’ political operation, told the [Washington *Post*](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/david-koch-steps-down-from-influential-conservative-network-he-helmed-with-his-brother/2018/06/05/aedeae68-68d6-11e8-bf8c-f9ed2e672adf_story.html) that the Koch network was “evolving.” But the Kochs have long favored free trade and minimal immigration barriers, both of which are consistent with their free-market beliefs, and also boost the profits of their multinational corporation. What has been evolving is merely their messaging, which casts their industry-friendly immigration and trade stances in terms of helping Dreamers and protecting low-income consumers.\n\nWhat is often overlooked, and is far more significant, is the large extent to which the Kochs’ policy preferences have prevailed under Trump. Trump’s only major legislative achievement, the tax bill, which reduced corporate taxes from thirty-five to twenty-one per cent, was passed with the support of a twenty-million-dollar campaign by Americans for Prosperity, the Kochs’ nationwide advocacy group. At the same time, the Kochs launched an equally effective political campaign to defeat the mechanism that Trump originally embraced to pay for these enormous tax cuts: a “border adjustment tax” devised by Republican Speaker of the House, Paul Ryan. Despite support from the White House and Republican leaders in Congress, the Koch network killed it. The final tax bill redistributed wealth from the bottom and the middle to the top and created gaping deficits that will likely require additional cuts in government spending, positions the Kochs have long embraced.\n\nTrump’s rollback of the Obama Administration’s environmental policies, crippling of Obamacare, and dismantling of key provisions in the Dodd-Frank financial-services law all have been top items on the Kochs’ wish list. There is no sign that David Koch’s departure from public life will significantly affect  any of this. The Kochs’ Seminar Network is promising to spend an estimated three to four hundred  million dollars  during the this fall’s midterm election. Evidently, even if there is only one Koch brother left at the table, the menu will remain exactly the same, and the tab will be larger than ever.","rubric":"","socialTitle":"One Koch Brother Forces the Other Out of the Family Business","socialDescription":"One less billionaire, but more political clout than ever.","seoTitle":"One Koch Brother Forces the Other Out of the Family Business","seoDescription":"Jane Mayer writes about David Koch’s retirement from Koch industries.

of the unsung heroes of the civil-rights legislation of the nineteen-sixties is a Republican congressman from Ohio named Bill McCulloch. Representing a nearly all-white district north of Dayton, McCulloch reflected the values of what was then still justifiably called the party of Lincoln. McCulloch preferred the term “equal rights” to “civil rights” because, as he put it, “the Constitution doesn’t say that whites alone shall have our most basic rights, but that we all shall have them.” In that spirit, and in partnership with Senator Everett Dirksen, of Illinois, a fellow-Republican, McCulloch did as much as anyone—apart from President Lyndon Johnson and those involved in the movement itself—to create and pass the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. As Todd Purdum notes in his book “An Idea Whose Time Has Come,” when McCulloch announced his retirement, in 1971, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis sent him a handwritten note, saying, “I know that you, more than anyone, were responsible for the civil rights legislation of the 1960s.”"],["p","This year’s midterm campaign demonstrated just how thoroughly the Republican Party, under the leadership of President Trump, has repudiated this heritage. As usual, Trump himself set the tone, by tweeting, shortly before Election Day, “Law Enforcement has been strongly notified to watch closely for any ",["em",{"class":"small"},"ILLEGAL VOTING"]," which may take place in Tuesday’s Election (or Early Voting). Anyone caught will be subject to the Maximum Criminal Penalties allowed by law.” It’s easy to trace the lineage of this threat to the Jim Crow era, when African-Americans were threatened with arrest and worse if they tried to register to vote. Many persisted in doing so anyway. Today, the methods employed may be less harsh, but the goal remains the same—to prevent certain Americans from exercising their rights."],["p","The Voting Rights Act was designed to redress intimidation and discrimination, but since the Supreme Court effectively neutered the law, in the 2013 case of Shelby County v. Holder, Republicans have embraced voter suppression with enthusiasm. In nearly every state where the G.O.P. has controlled the governorship and the legislature, it has tried to limit access to voting, most onerously by establishing such unnecessary requirements as having to produce a photo I.D. in order to register. (In a new twist this year, Native Americans in North Dakota were required to show a street address, which many people in that rural state do not have.) The stated justification for these actions has been to thwart incidents of voter fraud, such as non-citizens attempting to cast ballots, which is a nearly nonexistent problem. Trump and other Republicans turned voter fraud into a sort of all-purpose epithet, which they have also used to make spurious claims about the legitimate counting and recounting of votes in Florida, Georgia, and Arizona."],["p","Nonetheless, there were several important victories for voting rights this year. Florida voted overwhelmingly to rid the state of a vestige of its Jim Crow days—a law that forbade former felons from voting—and thus to reënfranchise 1.4 million citizens. In Kansas, Kris Kobach, the secretary of state, who was the architect of many of the worst voter-suppression schemes in the past decade, was defeated in the governor’s race. North Carolina, which became a graveyard for voting rights after the Shelby County case, added a Democrat to the state supreme court, who will help protect the right to vote from the Republican-dominated legislature. And, in New York, Democrats won a majority in the state senate, where, together with Governor Andrew Cuomo and the Democratic majority in the assembly, they have promised to reform the state’s appallingly restrictive rules on early and absentee voting."],["p","Even the good news from the election comes with a caveat, however. According to an analysis by the Brennan Center for Justice, Democrats won the over-all popular vote in the four hundred and thirty-five races for the House of Representatives by about nine per cent, but they managed to capture only a relatively narrow majority of seats. This is because the district lines are so egregiously gerrymandered, especially in states fully controlled by Republicans. Victories across the country will likely give Democrats a seat at the table when the lines are redrawn after the 2020 census, but gerrymandering deserves less a level playing field than a burial. Unfortunately, the only institution that could end the partisan practice, the Supreme Court, ducked its best chance to intervene when, earlier this year, it declined to upset the Republican redistricting of Wisconsin. Now, with the replacement of Anthony Kennedy by Brett Kavanaugh, it appears virtually certain that the Justices will not take up the issue in a productive way. And since Trump has effectively outsourced his judicial appointments to the Federalist Society, the incubator of far-right thinking on the law, recourse to the federal courts on voting rights may be a fading notion."],["p","Still, November brought some cause for optimism, and not only in the results from the first Tuesday. Just before the Federalist Society’s annual conference, a dozen prominent members, led by George T. Conway III, the husband of the White House counsellor Kellyanne Conway, announced that they are forming a group called Checks and Balances, which will seek to encourage conservatives to speak out whenever the President violates constitutional principles. “We believe in the rule of law,” they wrote. “We believe in the Constitution.” Coming from conservatives in the Trump era, such modest statements sound almost revolutionary. But this flicker of conscience offers the hope that more Republicans will try to reclaim the mantle of their predecessors."],["p","It is clear, at least, that the new crop of legislators—many of them women, many of them people of color, and all of them elected thanks to the engagement and the power of women voters—will do what they can to protect the right to vote. There’s also a lot of creative thinking going on about how to make elections fairer, with ideas like multiple-member districts and ranked-choice voting, which went into effect in Maine this year, getting serious consideration. As civil-rights heroes have known since the country’s founding, in a democracy all rights begin with the right to vote. Or, as Chief Justice Earl Warren wrote, “The right to exercise the franchise in a free and unimpaired manner is preservative of other basic civil and political rights.” He started out as a Republican, too. ♦"]]],"canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"sections":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine","children":[{"id":"592dfa44d5fda942c34a0b61","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"592dfa44d5fda942c34a0b61","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Comment","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"comment"},{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"},{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"}],"name":"Comment","parent":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"},"slug":"comment"}]}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"magazine","contributors":[{"name":"Jeffrey Toobin","type":"author","title":"Jeffrey Toobin has been a staff writer at \u003cem&gt;The New Yorker\u003c/em&gt; since 1993 and the senior legal analyst for CNN since 2002.

The ocean behind her was gray-green, uninviting, confused, the wind blowing hard onshore. A flock of surfers bobbed in the waves, a scattering of people strolled. Next to her, a huge black-and-orange L.E.D. roadwork sign flashed a series of messages: “",["em",{"class":"small"},"CLIMATE DENIAL KILLS"],"”; “",["em",{"class":"small"},"ABOLISH COAL ONIALISM"],"”; “",["em",{"class":"small"},"VOTE ECO LOGICALLY"],".” “I thought we would be getting a lot more questions, actually, about these specific messages,” Winckler said. “This one, for example, is pretty complicated.” The L.E.D. sign read “",["em",{"class":"small"},"HUMAN AGENDA AHEAD"],".”"],["p","The sign, which was solar-powered, was part of “Climate Signals,” a citywide installation by the artist Justin Brice Guariglia, presented by the Climate Museum in partnership with the Mayor’s office. Winckler, in a red leather jacket, the wind whipping her long brown hair, was taking part in “Ask a Scientist,” an event co-hosted by the museum and Columbia University’s Earth Institute, where Winckler works. Other scientists were stationed at nine other roadwork signs, situated across the five boroughs, in prominent and iconic public spaces: the 1964 World’s Fair Unisphere, in Queens; a former illegal dumping ground in the Bronx; Governor’s Island. The scientists at each post had handouts with “climate-communication tips,” such as “How to deal with a climate skeptic.” (One suggestion: look for common ground, i.e., how “we all depend on the same planet for our survival, and all of us want a good outcome.”)"],["p","One man rode by on his bike, staring at Winckler, then circled back and dismounted. “It says I can ask a scientist a question?” he said emphatically, indicating a banner hanging from a table in front of Winckler. She nodded. “I just got back from a cruise on the Rhine River, from Amsterdam to Frankfurt. Whole time there, in Germany, it was eighty-five degrees. I’m, like, ‘Eighty-five degrees! What’s going on here?’ They haven’t had rain in two months. The water levels were so low! Only twenty-five inches of water! Why? I’m asking you, why?” He was practically shouting."],["p","“I happen to actually come from Germany, so I know exactly what you’re talking about,” Winckler said. “There are changes to the climate system that we are seeing over longer time scales. This was a huge anomaly in Europe.”"],["p","Another curious passerby asked Winckler what, for her, was the biggest and scariest unknown in climate science.“What’s mostly occupying my mind right now, in terms of the importance of the question, is the contribution of ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/10/24/greenland-is-melting"},"Greenland"]," to sea-level rise,” she said. She nodded at the L.E.D. sign, which now read, “",["em",{"class":"small"},"50,000,000 CLIMATE REFUGEES"],".” “Sea-level rise is the big question that will affect pretty much everybody,” she continued. “Not just the coastal areas. Yes, there will be flooding. There already is flooding all over the place. But there are also all the indirect effects, like what the sign says: millions of climate refugees, forced migrations.”"],["p","Guariglia, the artist behind the roadwork signs, had been sitting in a traffic jam, waiting to go through the Holland Tunnel from New Jersey to Manhattan, when he saw a highway sign that was glitching on the side of the road. He recalled thinking, “Oh, L.E.D.s are flashing unreadable text, and my brain is registering it as something that’s out of place, and I cannot stop looking at it or thinking about it.” After thinking about it some more, he realized that the highway sign, which warns us to slow down and pay attention to what’s ahead, was “this great embedded metaphor.” “It’s exactly what we need right now across the planet,” he told me. The real challenge was then making his point at traffic-sign length. As he worked with the Climate Museum on the messages, the museum worked with the city to select locations for the signs and determined which languages—ultimately Spanish, French, Russian, and Chinese—should be included depending on local neighborhood demographics."],["p","At Rockaway, the sign was flashing in Russian. An eight-year-old named Miriam Bird, who was riding a scooter with her parents and four siblings, approached. “Is ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/climate-change"},"climate change"]," related to global warming?” she asked."],["p","“Yes, absolutely it is,” Winckler responded. “",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/global-warming"},"Global warming"]," just means that the temperature goes up, but there are other things that it causes, like the melting of ice, or the change in where it rains—more rain in places where it already rains a lot, or less rain in dry places, or no rain at all.” “In California, they are having a lot of wildfires because of global warming,” Bird said. Winckler nodded. Bird’s older brother, Cameron, asked whether climate change would affect all of the world’s biomes differently. It would. An elderly man stopped by and told Winckler that we were going to disappear in the next forty-eight years, at least Rockaway was: “We’re doomed.” He also wanted her to know that he had once met Jacques Cousteau, a scientist like her. “A very nice man,” he said."],["p","Was the man right, a curious bystander asked. Was Rockaway going to be completely gone within half a century? Winckler, who can’t help but think in millions of years, not hundreds, returned to Greenland. A few years ago, she said, scientists at Columbia’s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory had analyzed a rock core that had been drilled from underneath a Greenland glacier that was a hundred and twenty-five thousand years old. When galactic cosmic rays—like the ones that hit us from the sky every time we step outside—hit rock surfaces, certain isotopes are produced. When the rock was covered by an ice sheet, there was no isotope production."],["p","“So essentially you ask the rock beneath the ice sheet, ‘When did you last see the atmosphere?’ You want it to tell you ‘never’ or ‘ten million years ago.’ Then we wouldn’t have to worry about this,” Winckler said. That would mean, as scientists previously believed, that the sheet is stable, just a big ice cube sitting on top of the world. “But that was not the answer of the rock,” she said. The answer was that, in the last 1.2 million years, it was exposed for something like two hundred thousand years. “That’s a fairly long time,” Winckler said. “That means inherently there is something going on with the ice sheet that we weren’t aware of.” The new evidence suggests that the sheet—which would equal more than twenty feet of sea-level rise if it melted entirely—could thaw and flow into the Arctic Ocean at a potentially terrifying rate."],["p","A woman wearing a trucker hat and carrying a surfboard appeared. “Have those people been screaming at you guys?” she asked, gesturing down the block. At the intersection of Beach Ninety-fourth Street and Rockaway Beach Boulevard, a ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump"},"Trump"]," rally was under way. Winckler said no—that was a separate event, and they had ignored the scientists. As the afternoon passed and the rain picked up, the group, in “",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/news/letter-from-trumps-washington/under-trump-america-first-really-is-turning-out-to-be-america-alone"},"America First"],"” and Trump 2020 T-shirts, continued chanting “U.S.A.!” and waving ",["em",{"class":"small"},"MAGA"]," flags. Directly across the street, a group of counter-protesters had gathered, holding up signs like “Mermaids Against Misogyny” and “Rockaway Against Rape Culture.” On the ",["em",{"class":"small"},"MAGA"]," side, a man with a blow horn began to sing “God Bless America.” The counter-protesters quickly joined in, singing at the top of their lungs. For a moment, the two groups seemed like one. Then the song ended, everyone cheered, and a cop yelled, “Play ball!”"]]],"canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"sections":[{"id":"5904126172dadf5d0a508800","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news","children":[{"id":"5a8c99f952e589162b850cbc","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5a8c99f952e589162b850cbc","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Dispatch","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"dispatch"},{"id":"5904126172dadf5d0a508800","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news"},{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"}],"name":"Dispatch","parent":[{"id":"5904126172dadf5d0a508800","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"},"slug":"dispatch"}]}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"web","contributors":[{"name":"Carolyn Kormann","type":"author","title":"Carolyn Kormann is a staff writer at The New Yorker.","email":"","bio":["div",["p","Carolyn Kormann has been a contributor to the ",["em","The New Yorker"]," since 2012, and became a staff writer in 2018, covering energy, the environment, and climate change.

Her youngest child was exactly five months old on the day that the family, following protocol, got in line to surrender to Border Patrol. Days later, all four children were removed from Sandy’s care, including the still-nursing, months-old infant. The baby and his brothers were kept in a shelter, where they weren’t allowed to hug each other. Their mother was detained in a different state. They were separated from her for over a month."],["p","I won’t ventriloquize Sandy, and I can’t give voice to her baby. But I have a nursing son who is five months old, the same age as Sandy’s son was when he was taken from her, and I know my baby. I know the open-mouthed, wet-lipped, big-eyed look that he gives me when he is hungry. I know the small, guttural noises he makes to tell me it’s time to nurse. When he latches on to the breast, he melts into my chest with pleasure. His exposed arm reaches up to play with my necklace, or grab my chin, or finger a hem. I know the pace at which he sucks to get the breast to let down his milk, the clicking sound of his swallow. I know how much he can drink from the left breast before wanting to move to the right."],["p","My son doesn’t take a bottle. I know that if I were suddenly not there, and he was hungry, and someone put a bottle to his mouth, he would howl. He would get hungrier and angrier, and it would make it that much harder for him to learn this new feeding mechanism. Tears would stream down his face. And that’s before he’d even tasted the unfamiliar formula. And that’s assuming that the bottle-giver was someone he knew. I can’t imagine—or, rather, it hurts my heart to think about—how he would feel in the arms of a stranger, hungry, abandoned, alone."],["p","At five months, my son knows me. He knows his father, sister, extended family, friends. If I am away (by which I mean, if I disappear for five minutes to the next room), he greets me on return with the most radiant smile. He has soft, doughy little cheeks and big brown eyes, and if I bring my face close enough to his, he will give me a wet kiss with messy open lips, his hands extended to grab a fistful of hair from each side of my head.

I know to prop pillows around him, to cushion the fall. At five months, he is teething, and I know to run a clean finger firmly over his gums, to wipe the drool from his face to keep a rash away. At five months, my baby talks to me. He has likes and dislikes, needs and desires, a schedule. When he cries at night, I know that he might be hungry, teething, anxious, in pain, or just excited about the new things he has seen that day.

Observing the bittersweet reunion, Diaz-Cortes says, “While I’m there, the baby starts coughing up formula. She used to nurse him, breast-feed him, but her milk went dry when she was in detention. After all this, Sandy can’t even feed her own kid anymore.”"],["p","When my son first started sleeping through the night, my body didn’t expect it. My breasts would fill up in expectation of his hungry little mouth. The skin would tighten, the engorged breasts would harden, a certain pain would set in. Unbidden, my breasts would leak. My clothes would smell of undrunk milk. If someone took my baby away from me and kept him away for weeks, at first my body wouldn’t know what had happened. Then my body would think him dead.

Reading between the lines, the report seemed determined most of all to counter a widespread suspicion that Saudi Arabia’s young de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed, or M.B.S. as he’s popularly known, was behind the operation."],["p","“The crown prince had nothing to do with this issue,” al-Jubeir told the press conference, in Riyadh. “The criticism and fierce attacks targeting the kingdom are baseless and illogical.” He pledged that all involved would be punished and then, curiously, added that Saudi agents would not engage in such acts in the future."],["p","Instead of easing scrutiny of the kingdom, the prince’s inner circle is only digging a deeper hole for itself, U.S. congressional officials, former U.S. diplomats, and experts on Saudi Arabia told me. “Given the controlling nature of the regime, it is difficult to imagine that the murder was undertaken without the approval or understanding of senior officials,” James Smith, a former U.S. Ambassador to Riyadh, told me. “Without some degree of transparency, we are left with ‘trust me.’ ”"],["p","The Saudi investigation is merely “a poorly done coverup,” Bruce Riedel, a former senior C.I.A. analyst who also served in the White House and the Pentagon, told me. “Their story line is completely implausible—a team of fifteen killers travels to Istanbul where they take charge of a diplomatic facility with no instructions from the Saudi leadership and kill Jamal Khashoggi. The mastermind of the murder is undoubtedly the crown prince, which is why there is a coverup.”"],["p","The kingdom wants the actual executioners of the crime “to be seen to be punished,” Gregory Gause, the head of the Bush School of Government and Public Service at Texas A. &amp; M., told me. “In terms of determining the culpability of the top levels of the Saudi government, including the Crown Prince, the investigation has zero credibility.”"],["p","The ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump"},"Trump"]," Administration, on the other hand, appears willing to buy the latest Saudi story—and even to facilitate it. Within hours of the Saudi announcement, the Treasury Department imposed economic sanctions on seventeen Saudis, including some of the crown prince’s closest advisers. The Treasury Secretary, Steve Mnuchin, said that the men had “targeted and brutally killed a journalist who resided and worked in the United States” and must face the consequences for an “abhorrent” murder."],["p","Yet the sanctions will have limited impact—if any—on men already imprisoned in Saudi Arabia. And the Trump Administration was virtually forced to act after Congress, last month, ",["a",{"href":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/10/magnitsky-act-apply-khashoggi-case-181011184312416.html"},"invoked"]," the Magnitsky Act, which requires the White House to impose sanctions for major human-rights violations within a hundred and twenty-days. Gause described the U.S. move as a “minimum response.”"],["p","“The Treasury sanctions are mostly symbolic,” Riedel, the ",["a",{"href":"https://www.brookings.edu/book/kings-and-presidents/"},"author"]," of “Kings and Presidents: Saudi Arabia and the United States Since FDR,” told me. “The Administration is trying desperately to save M.B.S. from the consequences of his poor judgment.”"],["p","This week, both Republicans and Democrats have expressed skepticism about the White House’s intentions. “The Administration appears to be following the Saudi playbook of blaming mid-level officials and exonerating its leadership,” Senator Tim Kaine, a Democrat from Virginia, where Khashoggi resided after he went into exile last year, said. Ben Cardin, of Maryland, the senior Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, charged that President Trump is “enabling” the kingdom “in its effort to protect Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman from accountability.”"],["p","On Wednesday, Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican of South Carolina, who is often a defender of Trump, said that the powerful prince “has been unstable and unreliable, and I don’t see the situation getting fixed as long as he’s around.” The stakes in unravelling the Khashoggi murder ripple well beyond the desert kingdom and across the wider Middle East. Three of President Trump’s most important foreign-policy strategies—squeezing Iran, an Arab-Israeli peace plan, and containing jihadi extremism—rely on support from Saudi Arabia, and therefore on M.B.S., because he has consolidated control over all the kingdom’s major political, military, and economic decisions."],["p","Since Khashoggi’s murder, the Administration has even explored legal ways to get the Turkish President, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, to ease off pressure on Saudi Arabia—and halt the damaging leaks that he has made regarding the case, NBC News ",["a",{"href":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/white-house-weighs-booting-erdogan-foe-u-s-appease-turkey-n933996"},"reported"]," on Thursday. The White House has considered acceding to Erdoğan’s demand that Washington deport Fethullah Gülen, a popular Turkish cleric who has resided in Pennsylvania since 1999. Once an ally of the Turkish leader, Gülen was ",["a",{"href":"https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/turkey-military-coup/turkey-formally-requests-u-s-return-cleric-fethullah-gulen-not-n636791"},"blamed"]," by Erdoğan for a coup attempt against him, in 2016.

The bill includes a blanket embargo on sales of offensive weapons—munitions, bombs, missiles, aircraft, armored vehicles, and tanks—and use of U.S. aircraft to refuel Saudi warplanes in its three-year-old war on Yemen. The initiative was initiated by Graham, Todd Young, a Republican of Indiana, and Robert Menendez, a Democrat of New Jersey."],["p","In a statement, the Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, said that the United States would continue to “seek all relevant facts” and work with other nations to investigate Khashoggi’s murder. Yet the Administration has offered few of its own insights into his death since the director of the C.I.A., Gina Haspel, flew to Istanbul last month to be briefed and, among other things, listen to an audio recording of Khashoggi’s death. “The U.S. knows more about this than it is saying,” Gause told me."],["p","Meanwhile, Khashoggi’s son Salah posted a social-media notice on Thursday, saying that the family would begin to “accept condolences” at their father’s home in Jeddah—certain days for men, other days for women, as required in the rigid kingdom. For weeks, Khashoggi’s sons have appealed to the Saudi government to return their father’s body so he could be buried in Medina, his birthplace. That appears increasingly unlikely.

September 17th until Election Day, ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump"},"President Trump"]," tweeted nothing at all about the “witch hunt” by the special counsel, ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/robert-mueller"},"Robert Mueller"],", that had previously been a staple of his Twitter storms. With the midterm campaign in full swing, Trump showed that he was capable of restraint on the subject of Mueller, if only because he perceived a political benefit to his silence, reminding us that, no matter how scattershot, emotional, and impulsive his tweets seem, there are times when the President does practice a form of self-discipline. Trump clearly did not think it was a good idea to remind voters before the election that he is under investigation for serious potential crimes, including alleged conspiracy with the Russian election hacking of 2016 and obstruction of justice."],["p","So much for restraint. Within hours of his party losing the House of Representatives anyway, the President immediately returned the Mueller investigation to center stage, firing his Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, replacing him with a public critic of the Mueller investigation, and resuming his attacks on Mueller’s “disgusting Witch Hunt.” On Thursday morning, beset by negative media coverage about the possible unconstitutionality of his choice of the acting Attorney General, Matthew Whitaker, and having reportedly spent hours closeted with his lawyers going over answers to Mueller’s queries, Trump was back to full-on Twitter attack mode: “",["em",{"class":"small"},"A TOTAL WITCH HUNT LIKE NO OTHER IN AMERICAN HISTORY"],".”"],["p","The President is scared, and he is right to worry. I spent Wednesday on Capitol Hill, watching the real-time power shift as the House convened for its first post-election votes and members began the process of organizing for a new Democratic regime that will be defined by its aggressive efforts to investigate Trump and his Administration. Trump’s big sulk since the election suggests that the new reality of his political situation is starting to sink in, but I doubt he has fully reckoned with the consequences of pursuing a course of direct confrontation with another branch of government run by his diehard opponents. Richard Nixon, during Watergate, pushed the special prosecutor to the Supreme Court and lost when he refused to turn over the secret White House tapes. That course sank him in Congress. Reading Trump’s tweets this morning, I couldn’t help but wonder whether this President is also setting himself on a path toward a perilous legal confrontation over constitutional prerogatives."],["p","In an interview, Representative Adam Schiff, of California, described to me his evolving plan to act as Mueller’s congressional backstop, insuring that, even if Trump and Whitaker attempt to shut down the investigation, Mueller’s investigatory work and conclusions will not be covered up. Schiff, who is expected to secure the chairmanship when Democrats approve their new leadership, also made it clear that he will revive and expand the committee’s investigation of the Russia allegations that Republicans on the panel abruptly shut down earlier this year, telling me he would like to recall Steve Bannon, Trump’s former strategist, and Michael Cohen, the President’s estranged former lawyer and fixer, among others, to get answers that the G.O.P. majority wouldn’t or couldn’t extract."],["p","Most urgent is the crisis Trump has provoked in firing Sessions and installing Whitaker. Before our interview, Schiff had published a Washington ",["em","Post"]," op-ed, on Monday, promising, “Matthew Whitaker, we’re watching you.” In our conversation Schiff expanded on that, saying he was determined to “discover and expose any kind of wrongdoing” regarding the Mueller investigation. “If he takes any action adverse to the investigation or communicates any facts of the investigation to the President or his legal counsel, we’re going to find out about it,” Schiff told me. “There was a strong norm established after Watergate that the White House doesn’t intervene in specific cases. Now this is a specific case that involves the President, and this would go well beyond intervening. This would be affirmatively appointing someone to hinder the investigation.”"],["p","Schiff, a former federal prosecutor in California, said that he believes the Justice Department under Trump has set a precedent by turning over internal documents to the House Republicans in the Mueller probe and the investigation of Hillary Clinton’s e-mails that it would have to follow if Schiff demanded information regarding Whitaker’s actions involving Mueller. “They established a precedent, and I told them, ‘You are going to have to live with this,’ ” Schiff said. “ ‘Someone is going to be bereaved at the end of the Mueller investigation, and how are you going to say that the Democratic majority is not entitled to the same access to the materials that you have provided in the Clinton investigation or even in the Mueller investigation?’ ”"],["p","As for resurrecting the Intelligence Committee’s own Russia investigation, Schiff said the first step involves pushing to immediately release the transcripts from the panel’s interviews with key figures in the Mueller investigation; the committee has already voted to do so but never followed through. Schiff suggested that some of those who testified—he named the rogue Republican consultant and sometime Trump friend Roger Stone as one example—may have lied under oath in ways that would be relevant to Mueller and could subject them to possible perjury charges. “Our first order of business is to make sure that Mueller has the benefit of the work that we’ve done,” Schiff said, “so that he can view that evidence in the context of what he knows, which is far more than we do. But also so that he can determine whether people committed perjury before our committee.” Schiff said he wanted to recall Bannon because he simply refused to answer key questions when Republicans controlled the panel, not even bothering to cite a valid legal reason for his refusal beyond the White House’s request. And Trump’s former attorney Michael Cohen could have valuable additional information, given that his first testimony to the Hill panel occurred before he broke with the President and agreed to coöperate with Mueller. “We’d be very interested in talking to him again,” Schiff said."],["p","Mueller and the Russiagate allegations are hardly the only matters that should concern Trump. The new Democratic-controlled House is likely to investigate dozens of other scandals of the Trump era that the Republican majority has simply averted its gaze from; the Web site Axios has published ",["a",{"href":"https://www.axios.com/2018-midterm-elections-house-democrats-investigations-6bcfabb1-f1b2-49ce-8014-3e9b0c30db6c.html"},"a list of at least eighty-five different allegations and subjects"]," that might soon be the subject of hearings and subpoenas. Schiff is not the only incoming chairman eager to investigate. I asked Schiff, for example, about the enduring mystery of Trump’s private one-one-one meeting with the Russian President, Vladimir Putin, in Helsinki this summer, and whether his panel would try to uncover what had happened in it. Schiff said he wanted to look into it, but so did the House Foreign Affairs Committee. The Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi will have to adjudicate such disputes; I predict there will be many."],["p","No matter which committee is issuing the subpoenas, there is little doubt that Trump will choose a course of maximum confrontation, betting on the Republican-controlled Senate to be his bulwark against the Democrats. “We have to expect based on the President’s track record, based on

first votes of the House’s lame-duck session were called in the midst of our interview on Wednesday. When I walked over to the House floor with Schiff, I was reminded of how Congress, and politics more broadly, used to be, before Trump and the twenty-four-hour Twitter wars. Capitol Hill was always a place of backslappers and bipartisan bonhomie, where the heated rhetoric mostly stopped when the TV cameras were turned off."],["p","On the surface, it is still sort of that way, even after a campaign as scorching as any I can remember. At one point, Schiff and I got in an elevator with several other members of Congress, including the liberal Democratic congresswoman Maxine Waters, an African-American leader on the Financial Services Committee from California who has become a prime target of Trump, and Steve King, a far-right white congressman from Iowa who was denounced in the campaign for his sympathies toward white nationalists. “Hi, Maxine,” King said. “You’re gloriously dressed again today.” Waters smiled and responded politely. A similar scene played out as I waited for Schiff to return from casting his vote on the floor and saw Matt Gaetz, a junior congressman from Florida who has become one of Trump’s biggest congressional defenders on the TV talk shows, cheerily congratulate Kyrsten Sinema, the Democratic congresswoman from Arizona who had just pulled out a narrow win in her state’s Senate race."],["p","In our interview, Schiff began the conversation with the obligatory nods to bipartisanship and vows to restore “some semblance of comity” to a Congress that had lost it. He recalled fondly the “incredible gesture” of an Election Night phone call he received from the Texas Republican Lamar Smith back in 2010, when Republicans won the House and Smith stood to take over the Judiciary Committee. Smith had gone out of his way to ask Schiff, a member of the soon-to-be minority, to remain on his panel; it was, Schiff said, “one of the nicest phone calls I ever got.”"],["p","But this time there were no such phone calls, nor are there likely to be. Schiff told me he had not spoken with Devin Nunes, the panel’s Republican chairman, since the election, more than a week ago, and had no idea how the majority with which he once worked closely would handle the tricky period between now and the New Year, when Democrats take over. “The question is: Having walked away, are they going to walk back?” Schiff said. Schiff knows, of course, that a truce with Nunes, who abruptly shut down the panel’s probe of the Russia allegations earlier this year and has helped Trump float any number of unproved conspiracy theories about Mueller and the F.B.I., is beyond improbable."],["p","And, indeed, even as we were talking Wednesday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was on the Senate floor, refusing to take up a bipartisan measure, pushed by the Republican Jeff Flake and the Democrat Chris Coons, to protect Mueller from being fired by Trump. The barrage of Trump tweets attacking Mueller on Thursday morning “showed again why we need” the save-Mueller bill, Schiff said in a Twitter response of his own Thursday, but also why, with McConnell’s Senate a bulwark for Trump, the measure isn’t going to pass. Which means that Schiff and his fellow House Democrats will be the ones to wage the fight."],["p","So will Mueller be Trump’s undoing? “Impeachment” remains a taboo word for Democratic leaders who have officially pledged to keep an open mind until Mueller’s final report, but I asked Schiff whether he believes, based on what he’s seen so far, that the investigation constitutes any kind of existential threat to the Trump Presidency. “I think the only one who really knows that is Bob Mueller,” he said. Which is, of course, exactly why Adam Schiff has a new job in the upcoming Congress: Bob Mueller’s wingman."]]],"canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"sections":[{"id":"5904126172dadf5d0a508800","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news","children":[{"id":"5abaab1276329f082506d466","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5abaab1276329f082506d466","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Letter from Trump’s Washington","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"letter-from-trumps-washington"},{"id":"5904126172dadf5d0a508800","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news"},{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"}],"name":"Letter from Trump’s Washington","parent":[{"id":"5904126172dadf5d0a508800","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"},"slug":"letter-from-trumps-washington"}]}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"web","contributors":[{"name":"Susan B.

Lethem’s novel “",["a",{"href":"https://www.amazon.com/Motherless-Brooklyn-Jonathan-Lethem/dp/0375724834"},"Motherless Brooklyn"],",” which won the National Book Critics Circle Award for fiction in 1999, is a noir tale of mobsters and P.I.s that slips its suit to become a startling rumination on words and brains and the cords that correlate disparate ideas, sounds, and people. The main character, Lionel Essrog, works for a detective agency in the mostly benign thrall of a petty-crime lord named Frank Minna, who is murdered as the book opens. Lionel sets out to solve the mystery of his boss’s death. He has Tourette’s syndrome, and the novel lingers over the poetry of his logorrhea, how a word piped into his ear will set other words skittering from his mouth: ",["em","triage, arbitrage, sabotage"],". Tourette’s lends itself to detective work, Lethem implies. It conjoins elements, weaves meaning, deduces the shape of the thing. Tourette’s is a way of caressing the world with language. “Motherless Brooklyn,” with its interest in connectivity, might be read as a celebration of “consensual reality,” that which we create together and hold between us, “fragile and elastic . . . like the skin of a bubble.”"],["p","Lethem’s newest book, “",["a",{"href":"https://www.amazon.com/Feral-Detective-Novel-Jonathan-Lethem/dp/0062859064/"},"The Feral Detective"],",” begins in January, 2017, five days before the Inauguration of President ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump"},"Donald Trump"],", and consensual reality has popped. Or, rather, it has halved into two vesicles: red and blue America. The protagonist, Phoebe Siegler, is a New Yorker with Harvard, NPR, and the ",["em","Times"]," on her résumé; she unwinds by reading Elena Ferrante at a coffee shop. The rise of the “Beast-Elect” so disillusions her that she quits her job and breaks for the California badlands, where her friend’s teen-age daughter, Arabella, has gone missing. Phoebe is searching for Arabella, but perhaps she is also in search of a story: “Sew a Pepe the Frog medallion onto your backpack, young lady,” she thinks to herself. “Go seduce the unspeakable and hairy, then report back.” Phoebe enlists the help of Sam Heist, the feral detective of the title, a laconic and alluring Philip Marlowe type who has ties to the local community of runaways. Driving into the wilderness, the pair is swept up in a power struggle between two tribes of survivalists: the Rabbits (gentle, hippie-ish) and the Bears (ex-cons and bikers, tattooed, toxically masculine). Lethem seems to pull from “Mad Max” and “True Detective”—primordial dramas unfurling against desert voids. “Here in the desert we were enclosed in an unboundaried thing that ",["em","apocalypse"]," might be the word for,” Phoebe says. At one point, amid a gory ceremony to choose the next Bear King, Phoebe wades into the blood and muck to scream, “DO YOU EVEN KNOW WHAT’S GOING ON, YOU STUPID FUCKING ASSHOLES? DID YOU FUCKERS EVEN ",["em","VOTE"],"?”"],["p","A wonderfully menacing passage in this ridiculous book evokes the primal strangeness of the male id rising up to eat the world. Here is Solitary Love, the incumbent Bear liege, preparing to fight Heist:"],["blockquote",["p","His look and manner were a correction to what the nameless boy had called the chimerical dream of civilization. Seeing the Bear King stride into the flickering stony rink, it wasn’t even so much that all human charity and feeling . . . had been dispatched, rendered null—well, it was that, but it was more, too. Seeing him, you kind of wished it to be. Bring the flood. It was at this moment I did the math and realized that . . . Barack Obama was no longer president."]],["p","Here, Lethem captures the florid horror and the weird, nihilistic sense of possibility that arrived in the immediate wake of Trump’s election. Elsewhere, his tone is both wisecracking and stricken; its serious and comic notes cancel each other out, and what’s left is a cartoon despair."],["p","“The Feral Detective” is one of the first pieces of fiction to address the Trump Presidency, not obliquely (as in, for instance, Curtis Sittenfeld’s “",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/how-sloane-crosley-and-curtis-sittenfeld-make-profound-art-out-of-awkwardness"},"You Think It, I’ll Say It"],"”) but directly, inconsolably, furiously. Trump is “the monster in the tower”; the television that “had elected itself.” Lethem channels the unprocessed trauma of January, 2017—its stark existential bewilderment. (In an interview, the author ",["a",{"href":"http://www.vulture.com/2018/09/jonathan-lethem-the-feral-detective.html"},"cited J. R. R. Tolkien"],", the bard of vast vistas, as an influence.) “The Feral Detective” runs for nearly the same number of pages as “Motherless Brooklyn,” but it registers as much longer, both draggy and strained. It’s not just that the novel is loaded with lazy signifiers (Phoebe invokes the glories of “surefire viral content” and yearns “for my cubicle, for another Tinder date at the Bourgeois Pig”); it’s that Sam, her aide-de-camp and eventual lover, never lives on the page—he’s a thousand-mile stare, a leather jacket—and that Phoebe’s incessant, effortful banter is as repellent as Lionel’s was irresistible. “This discovery certainly did float my boat,” she says. “Talk to me in the King’s English, Tarzan, just like they taught you in finishing school,” she says. The Lethem of 1999 traffics in clean, taut, suggestive images. (“I could feel his anger unfolding, smooth as a fresh deck of cards.”) The 2018 Lethem attempts to transcend clichés via different, worse clichés. “I’ve endured my share of male strip-you-bare eyework,” Phoebe reflects, when she and Heist first size each other up, “but this was more existentially blunt, souls meeting in a sunstruck clearing.”"],["p","Lethem’s strategy for writing an “authentic” woman appears to consist mostly of emphasizing her sexuality. (“So I took my phone to a bakery and . . . hoped for some amusing college student to hit on me,” Phoebe recounts.) The author has stated that he was already “trying to talk about a crisis in gender relations” with his novel before Trump was coronated; afterward, he recommitted to the theme. The book suggests that men writ large are dangerous and atavistic (“stuck in the past”), whereas women writ large are flibbertigibbet clowns for whom nothing is sacred—more of a step sideways from Trumpism than a step forward."],["p","The real missing-persons case here is a meta one: Where has the sly, surprising Lethem gone? Phoebe perhaps expresses the author’s political frustration, his verbal playfulness, but the Essroggian inspiration has fled, as if an unerring gumshoe had been standing at the top of some steps when a masked figure with orange hair and a long red tie hit him over the head with a cudgel. “So many detectives have been knocked out and fallen into such strange swirling darknesses,” Lionel says, “such manifold surrealist voids.” The same fate has seized the novel, and us, trapping us in an America that is no hazy nightmare but our home."]]],"canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"sections":[{"id":"5908f18c98449f3364193dfd","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Books","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"books","children":[{"id":"5907eefc98449f3364193d6d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5907eefc98449f3364193d6d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Page-Turner","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"page-turner"},{"id":"5908f18c98449f3364193dfd","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Books","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"books"},{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"}],"name":"Page-Turner","parent":[{"id":"5908f18c98449f3364193dfd","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Books","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"books"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"},"slug":"page-turner"}]}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"web","contributors":[{"name":"Katy Waldman","type":"author","title":"Katy Waldman is a staff writer at \u003cem&gt;The New Yorker\u003c/em&gt;.","email":"","bio":["div",["p","Katy Waldman is a staff writer at ",["em","The New Yorker"],".

of universal suffrage in the U.S. Constitution. From the start, the franchise was defined by who could not, rather than who could, vote. On Election Day, people who were unable to meet intentionally restrictive I.D. requirements, which disproportionately affect people of color, were given provisional ballots. This was just the latest chapter in a long history of voter suppression. And, when these provisional ballots were contested immediately after the election, as Republican lawmakers, led by ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump"},"President Donald Trump"],", began to call fraud on efforts to insure the most fundamental premise of a free and fair election—that every vote counts and counts equally—that chapter grew a lot longer. Although it is not clear what impact these false accusations of voter fraud may have in future elections, what they expose, right now, is a blatant attack on democracy itself."],["p","Prior to the election, Brian Kemp, the secretary of state of Georgia, who was in charge of overseeing his own election while running for governor, ",["a",{"href":"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/10/26/18024468/georgia-voter-suppression-stacey-abrams-brian-kemp-voting-rights"},"repudiated"]," ongoing efforts to restore the one and a half million voters his office eliminated from the rolls between 2012 and 2016, many because of small discrepancies in their addresses, names, or voter histories. Kemp resigned as secretary of state on Thursday, after declaring himself the winner of Georgia’s gubernatorial race, and Governor Nathan Deal appointed a crony, Robyn Crittenden, to take Kemp’s place. On Sunday, Stacey Abrams, Kemp’s challenger, filed a class-action suit to delay certification of the election until every ballot is counted. Late Monday night, in response to a different suit, this one filed on the eve of the election by the Washington watchdog organization Common Cause, the district-court judge Amy Totenberg ",["a",{"href":"https://www.wsj.com/articles/federal-judge-orders-georgia-to-wait-until-friday-to-certify-election-results-1542095354"},"enjoined"]," the Georgia secretary of state from certifying the election until this Friday. Among other things, Totenberg’s order required Crittenden to provide ",["a",{"href":"https://twitter.com/bluestein/status/1062189673420939264"},"rolling updates"]," on rejected provisional ballots and to set up a phone line for voters to check their ballots’ status. Meanwhile, the Kemp campaign issued a statement calling “Stacey Abram’s antics . . . a disgrace to democracy.” President Trump weighed in, too, saying on Twitter that Kemp “ran a great race in Georgia—he won! It is time to move on.”"],["p","Trump has also inserted himself in the Florida elections, where the races for governor and Senate are so close that they have triggered a recount. “The Florida election should be called in favor of Rick Scott and Ron DeSantis in that large numbers of new ballots showed up out of nowhere, and many ballots are missing or forged,” Trump tweeted. To be clear, ",["a",{"href":"https://www.miaminewtimes.com/news/miami-ballots-are-still-inside-opa-locka-post-office-10899192"},"there is no evidence"]," that ballots have been forged, and, if any are missing, it may be because, like the hundreds discovered in a Miami-Dade postal facility over the weekend, they were never delivered. Scott, the governor of Florida, who is a fraction of a per cent ahead of Bill Nelson in the race for Senate, ",["a",{"href":"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/election/article221502395.html"},"has used his current office"]," to call on the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to investigate “rampant fraud” in South Florida and to urge state sheriffs to impound voting machines. In a letter to Scott requesting that he remove himself from the recount process, leaders at the local chapters of the League of Women Voters and Common Cause wrote that the governor has “intentionally politicized governance of the elections,” and pointed out that the Florida Department of Law Enforcement has not found any indication of election fraud. On Monday, the nonpartisan non-profit, Protect Democracy, filed suit in federal court to have Scott removed from exercising any authority over the election or the recount. Meanwhile, Scott has fired off five lawsuits of his own, including ",["a",{"href":"https://www.salon.com/2018/11/10/rick-scott-launches-voter-fraud-lawsuit-based-on-conspiracy_partner/"},"one against the Broward County"]," election supervisor for counting absentee ballots too slowly. “No ragtime group of liberal activists or lawyers from D.C. will be allowed to steal this election from the voters in this great state,” he said at a press conference announcing the suit. (It was dismissed on Monday.)"],["p","The rancor and wrangling in Georgia and Florida are the exceptions, but the rule turns out to be that voters across the country encountered impediments to voting on Tuesday, including prolonged wait times, intimidation, and broken voting machines. A woman named Michelle from Porter County, Indiana, ",["a",{"href":"https://twitter.com/varin/status/1060937524040884224"},"posted a long thread on Twitter"]," about her experience as a first-time poll worker that hit many of the discordant notes we’d been hearing from all over the country on Election Day: polls that couldn’t open on time because poll workers hadn’t shown up; polling places that didn’t open at all; missing ballots; ballots that weren’t being counted. The Election Protection Coalition, ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/news/dispatch/the-national-hotline-for-voter-complaints-has-received-more-than-twenty-thousand-calls-on-election-day"},"which runs the largest nonpartisan voter hotline"]," in the country, logged more than thirty thousand calls from voters across the country experiencing problems."],["p","With few exceptions, American elections are overseen by the country’s 3,141 counties and their equivalents, which in turn oversee more than 174,000 precincts. The precincts themselves are watched over by ",["a",{"href":"https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2018/10/22/few-people-want-to-be-poll-workers-and-thats-a-problem"},"volunteer poll workers"],", who are tasked with turning school gyms and church basements into one-day civic hubs equipped with technology few of them understand. (Most are retirees; twenty-four per cent of them are over seventy-one.) The amateur quality to the whole endeavor is by design: it’s a way to insure that, at its core, American democracy is local. This was beneficial early Tuesday morning when people were sent away from a Philadelphia church because voting machines were malfunctioning. Once the machines were fixed, poll workers phoned the people who had left to tell them to come back. “They were all neighbors,” Micah Sims, the executive director of Common Cause Pennsylvania, told me. “They knew who hadn’t been able to vote.”"],["p","But untrained (or poorly trained) poll workers were also responsible for sending voters to the wrong precincts, for telling people they had already voted when they hadn’t, for refusing language assistance to non-native speakers, and for aggressively challenging voters’ credentials. In Florida, when a Puerto Rican woman presented her U.S. passport as I.D., she was told, wrongly, that she couldn’t vote because she wasn’t from this country. In Texas, an election worker was heard making racist remarks after challenging the veracity of a voter’s address. In her Twitter account, Michelle, from Indiana, reported that her requests for poll-worker training were ignored. Even if that weren’t so, it’s unlikely that she, or many others supervising elections, would have had the expertise to fix the broken voting machines and jammed scanners that bedeviled numerous precincts—eighteen polling places in Philadelphia alone. Malfunctioning voting machines, most of which are well past their use-by date, were predictable. Many will still be in service in 2020, either because there is no money for replacements, or because, as the election security expert Harri Hursti told me last August, counties are locked into long-term vender contracts."],["p","Four days before the midterms, the secretary of Homeland Security, Kirstjen Nielsen, ",["a",{"href":"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/midterms-secure-elections-us-history-dhs-chief/story?id=58925202"},"told"]," the Council on Foreign Relations, “This is going to be the most secure election we’ve ever had.” On election day, D.H.S. set up a “virtual situation room” in Arlington, Virginia, with a hotline that election officials could call to report problems. Representatives from the major voting-machine manufacturers gathered in an unclassified area along with staffers from Facebook, Microsoft, the National Association of Secretaries of State, and the National Association of Election Officials. (High-level threats were handled in a classified briefing room.) For nearly two decades, Hursti and his colleagues have been ringing the alarm about the insecurity of computerized voting systems, like the ones used in Georgia. Voting machines, centralized tabulators, wireless systems for sending data, electronic poll books, and voter-registration databases are all vulnerable to various kinds of hacking. The 2016 election was proof of concept. This year, Christopher Deluzio, a lawyer with the Democracy Program at N.Y.U.’s Brennan Center for Justice, was an observer in the unclassified section of D.H.S.’s situation room. “It was useful to have the venders there when calls came in about problems with electronic poll books, and especially some of the older machines and software,” he said. But, he cautioned, “it is probably premature to assess how secure the election really was.”"],["p","One new security feature touted by D.H.S. was the addition of sensors designed to detect malicious activity on the election networks of forty states and sixty municipalities. (In 2016, twenty-nine states had them.) Although network sensors might have helped secure the election, they might not have helped very much. A Government Accountability Office test ",["a",{"href":"https://www.csoonline.com/article/3030028/security/dhs-einstein-firewall-fails-to-detect-94-of-threats-doesnt-monitor-web-traffic.html"},"found"]," that the sensors failed to detect ninety-four per cent of known malware. Another study showed them failing ninety-nine per cent of the time. Just as crucially, sensors cannot detect insider hacks, especially when those insiders have administrative access to electronic poll books, voter-registration databases, and ballot programming software."],["p","This was acknowledged in Judge Totenberg’s Monday evening order, which noted that “according to Plantiff’s Complaint, information in the State’s voter registration server, used at the polls to determine whether voters are eligible to vote, is vulnerable to multiple security breaches and exploitable by manipulation of voter data. . . . Plantiff further alleges that the Secretary’s knowing maintenance of an unsecure, unreliable voter registration database increased the risk that eligible voters have been and will be unlawfully removed from the State’s voter registration database or will have their voter registration information unlawfully manipulated or mismanaged that prevents them from casing a regular ballot.” As Susan Greenhalgh, the policy director of the National Election Defense Coalition told me in an e-mail recently, “While we gird against the possibility of foreign hackers attacking our election infrastructure, we also can’t ignore the possibility of corrupt insiders tampering with the election systems.”"],["p","There is a school of thought that American democracy is harmed by talk of election hacking and system vulnerabilities because these will discourage people from voting. (Apparently, this was one reason that President Obama did not immediately inform the American public about Russian attempts to infiltrate the election system). But this turns out not to be true. A Harris poll from September, which was commissioned by the security firm HackerOne, found that people were actually more likely to vote in the midterms because of their fear of hacking. Last week’s record turnout at least partly confirmed this."],["p","Still, long lines, broken voting machines, and discriminatory I.D. laws are known deterrents that will continue to dog American elections until they are systematically addressed. States actively committed to increasing voter participation, such as Colorado, Washington, Oregon, and Vermont, have passed a series of simple voting reforms, including same-day registration, automatic voter registration when getting a driver’s license, early voting, and enabling voting by mail by lifting restrictions on who can obtain an absentee ballot. Last Tuesday, a majority of citizens in Florida chose to restore voting rights to felons, and, in Michigan, a package of reforms popularly known as “promote the vote” garnered a sixty-six per cent victory, both cases demonstrating the national appetite for an electoral system that is as it is supposed to be: free and fair."],["p","Even as the vote counts continue in Florida and Georgia, the newly invigorated Democratic members of the House of Representatives have promised that their first act in the new Congress will be legislation to make voting easier and more inclusive. This is aspirational. It has no chance of passage in the Senate, where Republican members know that maintaining a majority will mean disenfranchising a sizable portion of the body politic. And that is to say nothing of a President who is unacquainted with the practice of democracy."]]],"canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"sections":[{"id":"5904126172dadf5d0a508800","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news","children":[{"id":"590a02541c7a8e33fb390be1","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"590a02541c7a8e33fb390be1","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News

July, I walked along one of the oldest existing sections of the border wall between the U.S. and Mexico, on the San Diego side. My companions on this walk were not bad people. They had come to Southern California on a church mission, and their group, of two dozen teen-agers and three adults, had taken the afternoon to go on a walk organized by the Border Angels, a nonprofit that helps immigrants coming across the Mexican border. As the Angels told the visitors about their work—leaving water in the desert for those crossing between the so-called ports of entry, among other things—the visitors nodded in sympathy. Later, as we walked in the scorching sun, the adults in the church mission told me that they had nothing against immigrants; they only wished that they would follow the proper legal procedures. As we talked of the shelters full of aspiring asylum seekers just on the other side of the wall, in Tijuana, and of the overtaxed ports of entry where lines stretched for weeks, they allowed that the laws and procedures may need to be changed. Until then, however, crackdowns, and the wall itself, were inevitable, they said. They had voted for ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump"},"Donald Trump"],"."],["p","On Friday, Trump ",["a",{"href":"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/presidential-proclamation-addressing-mass-migration-southern-border-united-states/"},"signed a proclamation"]," that denies the right to ask for asylum to anyone who does not use an official port of entry to cross the southern border. The American Civil Liberties Union, the Center for Constitutional Rights, and the Southern Poverty Law Center immediately joined forces ",["a",{"href":"https://www.aclu.org/blog/immigrants-rights/deportation-and-due-process/president-trumps-proclamation-suspending-asylum"},"to sue the Administration"],". The groups claim that the proclamation violates federal law, which recognizes the right of people to seek asylum regardless of where and how they entered the country; it also breaks the law, ",["a",{"href":"https://www.aclu.org/legal-document/east-bay-sanctuary-covenant-v-trump-complaint"},"they say"],", by circumventing the normal notice-and-comment period. Finally, though the lawsuit doesn’t mention this, the proclamation also contradicts the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was drafted and adopted by the U.N., in 1948, and which guarantees ‘the right to seek and to enjoy in other countries asylum from persecution.’ ”"],["p","The media reported the news of the proclamation uncritically. ",["a",{"href":"https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/09/politics/trump-signs-asylum-order/index.html"},"CNN wrote"]," that the measure will “bar migrants who cross into the US illegally through the southern border from seeking asylum.” The ",["em","Times"]," referred to “the illegal entry of immigrants across the southern border” in ",["a",{"href":"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/09/us/politics/trump-asylum-seekers-executive-order.html"},"the first line of its story"],". In fact, there is nothing illegal about seeking asylum, even if, as a matter of practice, people entering outside ports of entry are often charged with misdemeanor offenses. But Trumpian hysteria over the influx of immigrants has served to make the bureaucratic requirement of entering “officially” seem reasonable. “Entry at ports of entry at the southern border allows for orderly processing,” the President’s proclamation says. Before it gets to that calming promise, however, it uses the words “violence,” “crisis,” and “unlawful.” The message is that the people coming to the United States are dangerous, criminal, and, most importantly, undeserving: “Only a fraction of the claimants . . . ultimately qualify for asylum or other protection.”"],["p","This story of undeservedness rests on the distinction between refugees and migrants; the latter word has come into particularly wide usage since ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/how-the-mainstream-media-normalizes-trumps-anti-immigrant-rhetoric"},"the so-called caravan"]," became a feature of Trump’s campaigning in advance of the ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/midterms-2018"},"midterm elections"],". The people coming to the border from Latin America are fleeing gang violence and extreme poverty. Under existing U.S. asylum rules, neither circumstance would entitle them to asylum protection, though the Obama Administration recognized the fear of gang violence as grounds for asylum. But the distinction between the two words is a legal fiction: it asserts that economic hardship is somehow separate from political disenfranchisement and political persecution. Implicit in this claim is the view that economic inequality across nations is somehow natural, and therefore the citizens of wealthier nations have no responsibility to shelter those who are fleeing poverty elsewhere. The distinction between political and economic migrants is relatively new, dating to the second half of the twentieth century. But now that climate change is displacing tens of millions of people, its immorality comes into ever greater relief."],["p","Many arguments have been, and will continue to be, advanced for the distinction between refugee and migrant, as well as for the creation of the ports of entry, for Trump’s proclamation, and even for the border wall itself. All of these arguments are founded on the understanding that free movement of people across borders is undesirable, frightening, and ultimately impossible. As long as this premise goes unchallenged, people who think of themselves as good and compassionate will be able to support Trump and his Administration’s war on immigrants."]]],"canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"sections":[{"id":"5904126172dadf5d0a508800","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news","children":[{"id":"59ef6620c6604764e97c762c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"59ef6620c6604764e97c762c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Our Columnists","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"our-columnists"},{"id":"5904126172dadf5d0a508800","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news"},{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"}],"name":"Our Columnists","parent":[{"id":"5904126172dadf5d0a508800","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"},"slug":"our-columnists"}]}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"web","contributors":[{"name":"Masha Gessen","type":"author","title":"Masha Gessen, a staff writer, has written several books, including, most recently, “\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Future-History-Totalitarianism-Reclaimed-Russia/dp/159463453X/\"&gt;The Future Is History: How Totalitarianism Reclaimed Russia\u003c/a&gt;,” which won the National Book Award in 2017.","email":"","bio":["div",["p","Masha Gessen began contributing to ",["em","The New Yorker"]," in 2014, and became a staff writer in 2017.

On Saturday, a planned Presidential trip to Aisne-Marne, a cemetery and memorial in France for American war dead, was cancelled due to rain, a decision scorned by, among others, Nicholas Soames, a British M.P., who ",["a",{"href":"https://twitter.com/NSoames/status/1061270124404113408"},"tweeted"],", “They died with their face to the foe and that pathetic inadequate @realDonaldTrump couldn’t even defy the weather to pay his respects to The Fallen.” (Soames is a grandson of Winston Churchill.) Trump did little to diminish the sense that he was out of his depth, protocol-wise, by ",["a",{"href":"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1061171030801158146"},"tweeting"]," that he was “getting ready to celebrate the end of World War One,” making the commemoration of the Armistice on the hundredth anniversary of the end of the fighting of the war sound like Melania’s birthday. “Is there anything better to celebrate than the end of a war, in particular that one, which was the bloodiest and worst of all time?” he thumbed. On Sunday, Trump appeared at the cemetery in Suresnes where more than fifteen hundred American soldiers who died in the First World War are buried. In attendance were several veterans of the Second World War, whom Trump addressed with familiarity from the podium. “You look so comfortable up there, under shelter, as we’re getting drenched,” he said, with a chuckle. “You’re very smart people.”"],["p","For a primer on how a head of state might behave on an occasion as solemn as the observance of the end of a war in which an estimated ten million military personnel were killed, Trump might have looked across the Channel, where the Queen of England was appearing at the annual remembrance ceremony in Whitehall. The Queen, who was born only eight years after the war ended, attended a memorial service at Westminster Abbey and then observed the ceremonial laying of wreaths at the foot of the Cenotaph. Unlike the President, who avoided military service in Vietnam with a supposed diagnosis of bone spurs on his heels, the Queen enlisted in the military during the war of her youth, albeit in a role unlikely to face real conflict: in 1945, she joined the Auxiliary Territorial Service as a vehicle mechanic, seven years before ascending to the throne. On Sunday, the Queen, who is the official head of the armed forces in Britain, watched the marching ranks of veterans from the balcony of the Foreign Office. The Queen does not do ingratiation, having for the past sixty-six years not encountered anyone more highly ranked than she—and, on Sunday, her facility for stony-faced impassivity served her well, as she stood, diminutive and stoic during the long ceremony, flanked by her daughter-in-law and granddaughter-in-law, the Duchesses of Cornwall and Cambridge, all in black coats, black hats, and red poppies."],["p","Central London was awash with poppy lapel pins on Sunday, as thousands gathered in and around Westminster to pay their respects. After a scouring shower of rain first thing in the morning, the skies were blue with scudding clouds; and if the November sun did not rise much above the tops of the trees in St. James’s Park, where crowds gathered opposite Horse Guards Parade to watch the assembling marchers, the conditions might have proved tolerable even to President Trump. Long, orderly lines formed off Trafalgar Square to enter Whitehall proper, while large crowds gathered along Pall Mall to watch the ceremony in the abbey, which was being broadcast on several Jumbotrons. The atmosphere was sober and relatively formal, for every ten tourists in a puffer jacket among the crowds there seemed to be a veteran of one war or another, some visibly distinguished by a uniform, others by simply wearing his or her medals pinned to a coat or jacket. Participants in the People’s Procession, a march of ten thousand civilians, had been mustering since early morning, with veterans in wheelchairs moving alongside matrons in funereal black. Quiet fell among the crowd long before the signal for the official two-minute silence, a shattering cannon blast, at 11 ",["em",{"class":"small"},"A.M."]," After that, there was no disturbance but for birdsong, the distant siren of an emergency vehicle, a baby’s cry, and the rustle of yellow leaves in the wind."],["p","For a conflict that ended a century ago, and of which there are no living survivors, the First World War remains remarkably alive in British memory. It is studied in secondary schools, in some cases with field trips to Flanders or Ypres for students to see the cemeteries of war dead and to clamber into trenches at ",["a",{"href":"https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sanctuary-wood-museum"},"Sanctuary Wood"],", where the same corrugated iron that offered flimsy protection to British soldiers still stands. “War Horse,” the adaptation of the Michael Morpurgo novel that originated at the National Theatre, in 2007—and has just returned there for a sold-out run—ran for eight years in the West End, twice as long as the duration of the war it dramatized. And on Sunday evening the national observance continued with the airing on the BBC of a breathtaking documentary made by Peter Jackson, the director from New Zealand best known for “The Lord of the Rings.”"],["p","“They Shall Not Grow Old”—the title comes from the patriotic ",["a",{"href":"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/57322/for-the-fallen"},"poem"]," by Laurence Binyon, who served in the Red Cross on the Western Front—draws upon footage shot for a silent film, “",["a",{"href":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ_OZfaiUlc"},"The Battle of the Somme"],",”made in 1916, which inter-spliced real scenes of soldiers readying themselves for battle, or lying dead in its aftermath, with scenes of troops going “over the top” of their trenches in training sessions in advance of the conflict. The footage from the film, and also film shot in the following two years, has supplied First World War documentaries for decades, including the landmark television series “The Great War,” the twenty-six episodes of which were first broadcast, in 1964, to mark the fiftieth anniversary of the conflict."],["p","In the hands of Jackson and his team, however, the footage is seen as never before. Not only has it been restored, with spotting and crackling removed, but it has been sensitively colorized, bringing tone to the cheeks of the live soldiers and dull pallor to those of the dead ones. Most spectacularly, it has been digitally adjusted, so that the film no longer has what Jackson characterized as a “Charlie Chaplin” quality in a question-and-answer at the movie’s première at the British Film Institute.  Instead, the soldiers and horses, tanks and stretchers, move at a real-life pace. At a stroke—artfully timed in the documentary to coincide with the soldiers’ transfer from training camp to the Western Front itself—the distant figures of a hundred years ago are transformed into recognizably familiar brothers, fathers, and sons, with their big grins and terrible British teeth. They are disconcertingly immediate, whether they are jovially responding to the novel presence of a movie camera in their midst or absorbed in all-consuming fear in the minutes before being sent out to participate in an assault from which, the record shows, very few of those filmed returned."],["p","Lip readers who specialize in discerning the words spoken on surveillance videos for police investigations were recruited to examine the silent footage, and regional actors were hired to deliver the fragments of speech thus recovered, so that, for the first time, the soldiers on camera—many of whom died within minutes of being captured on film—can be heard as well as seen. The result is eerie, and intensely moving. “Hello, Mum!” one lad shouts as he strides through the muddy desolation of France; in another remarkable sequence, the audio is restored to a scene in which an officer gives a pep talk to his men shortly before the battle, for which Jackson found the exact text in an online archive and matched it to the sequence."],["p","The movie eschews traditional narration: in addition to the restored audio, the soundtrack consists of archival recordings of veterans that were gathered by oral historians. Contrary to the narrative most often presented of the Great War, many of the participants acknowledged the excitement of signing up and spoke of what they enjoyed about the service: being part of a community and the satisfaction of doing a job well. The voices are often phlegmatic, as British men of their generation were expected to be, which only increases the pathos of their words. “They say your past rises up when you’re going to die, but I didn’t have very much past, being nineteen,” one recalls. Another remembers the horrific conditions they endured, with recognizable English understatement and sarcasm: when it was pouring rain and the soldiers were slipping in mud, “the language was very edifying.” Of course, these men had no choice about whether to be there. The film, which is to be released in the U.S. in December, makes for devastating watching: Jackson does not shy away from showing, and colorizing, the blasted skulls and shattered limbs, or the rats that feast on them. But it should be required viewing for all those who want to better understand war and its costs—or ought to better understand it, including a U.S. Commander-in-Chief who, come rain or shine, is currently in a position to precipitate one of his own."]]],"canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"sections":[{"id":"5904126172dadf5d0a508800","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news","children":[{"id":"5a85c96108ed787fc1cfd378","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5a85c96108ed787fc1cfd378","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Letter from the U.K.","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"letter-from-the-uk"},{"id":"5904126172dadf5d0a508800","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news"},{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"}],"name":"Letter from the U.K.","parent":[{"id":"5904126172dadf5d0a508800","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"},"slug":"letter-from-the-uk"}]}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"web","contributors":[{"name":"Rebecca Mead","type":"author","title":"Rebecca Mead joined \u003cem&gt;The New Yorker\u003c/em&gt; as a staff writer in 1997.

before President Trump, at a press conference last Wednesday, derided a CNN reporter as a “terrible person,” he claimed, briefly, to be out of touch with his emotions. How, the President wondered, was he supposed to feel about the midterm electoral defeat of so many moderate and suburban Republicans? “I’m not sure that I should be happy or sad,” he said. True, their loss had cost his party control of the House. On the other hand, as he saw it, many of them had never been demonstrative enough in showing their loyalty to him or in asking for his help; they didn’t “want the embrace.” They should have known that without Trump they were nothing. And so, on balance, he said, “I feel just fine about it.”"],["p","Whether the President is happy or sad has become the central, if not the sole, concern of the Republican Party and of his Cabinet. A few hours after the press conference, Attorney General Jeff Sessions was finally forced to resign, yet, even in his resignation letter, he pleaded to be understood as an ideological loyalist, praising the President for his focus on the “rule of law.” Sessions was indeed a true Trumpist, particularly when it came to immigration policy. The White House’s announcement, on Thursday, that it was severely restricting asylum claims could almost be seen as an act of spite—denying Sessions the chance to preside over the demolition of a system he had so eagerly undermined."],["p","Sessions’s one misstep was to recuse himself from oversight of Robert Mueller’s investigation into possible Russian interference in the 2016 election. Trump believes that it’s the Attorney General’s job to protect the President from such annoyances. By most accounts, the man he has named acting Attorney General, Matthew Whitaker, believes so, too. When a reporter asked Trump if Whitaker would “rein in Robert Mueller,” he replied only, “What a stupid question.” Perhaps, to him, the answer was obvious."],["p","One of the more dangerous outcomes of the midterms is the belief, in some quarters of the G.O.P., that putting the Party in Trump’s hands was worth it. Three of the Democratic senators whom he personally campaigned against—Joe Donnelly, in Indiana; Claire McCaskill, in Missouri; and Heidi Heitkamp, in North Dakota—lost. “He worked very hard, drew large crowds, and I think it clearly had a positive impact,” Mitch McConnell, who will remain the Senate Majority Leader, said, apparently untroubled by the bigotry, the lies, and the fear-mongering that Trump had used as he worked up those crowds. McConnell also warned against “Presidential harassment”—a phrase that, in the Trump era, could describe many things, but by which he meant the Democrats’ using control of the House to investigate Trump."],["p","Despite Trump’s description of the midterm results as “close to complete victory,” there were some notable setbacks for his party, especially at the state level, with a net loss of at least six governorships and more than two hundred legislative seats. Some of the Republican House members who won’t be returning in January, including the twenty-three who chose to retire, would likely agree that they might have been able to keep their seats if they had embraced Trump, but they just could not or would not make that bargain. Others stayed away for a pragmatic reason: Trump was deeply unpopular in their districts. The President said that Barbara Comstock, the incumbent in Virginia’s Tenth District, was among those who had forfeited a win by not aligning herself with him. In fact, she lost to an opponent, Jennifer Wexton, who had labelled her “Barbara Trumpstock.” Trump’s kind of Republican would have bragged about how great that sounded."],["p","Yet Trump is right in one respect. The midterms ",["em","were"]," a party-building exercise, if all one was trying to build is the Party of Trump. The G.O.P. is acclimating itself to accepting divisiveness and unconstitutional travesties—including, perhaps, efforts to end birthright citizenship—in return for a few Senate seats. Worse, more and more Republicans elected under Trump’s auspices, such as Josh Hawley, of Missouri, and Marsha Blackburn, of Tennessee, don’t even see their association with him as a trade-off. They like what the President stands for and seem to regard being loyal to him and keeping him happy as natural parts of the job."],["p","The same appears true of Whitaker. A former federal prosecutor who was, until last week, Sessions’s chief of staff, Whitaker is, in many ways, a walking distillation of Trumpism. He has spoken of the border as being “under assault” and of the need for “New Testament” judges; and, in an echo of his new boss’s flimflammery, he was recently involved in a questionable invention-marketing operation. (“Anybody that works for me, they do a number on them,” Trump said on Friday. He added, “I don’t know Matt Whitaker”—a reminder that Trumpist loyalty goes only one way.) Whitaker has already announced that there never was any collusion with Russia: last year, in a column for CNN, he wrote that Mueller was headed for “witch hunt” territory."],["p","Nevertheless, instead of recusing himself, as Sessions did, Whitaker has taken control of Mueller’s investigation; even if he doesn’t fire the special counsel, he could try to veto subpoenas that Mueller’s team might want to serve on the President or on members of his family. Mueller has apparently begun writing his final report; efforts by the Administration to scuttle any indictments could easily escalate into obstruction of justice. According to the ",["em","Times"],", by last Thursday congressional Democrats, who are anticipating the subpoena power that the chairmanship of House committees will give them, had held a conference call to map out ways to protect Mueller—or to jump into the fight themselves."],["p","The firing of Sessions is an illustration of how the President’s demand for loyalty brings the country ever closer to a constitutional crisis. Whitaker has said that the list of Supreme Court decisions that he thinks are wrong begins with Marbury v. Madison—the landmark 1803 case that delineated the Court’s power to interpret the Constitution, and which is woven into almost every aspect of American jurisprudence. If the Court doesn’t decide what’s constitutional, who does? Trump?"],["p","On Friday, meanwhile, the President headed to Paris for a centennial commemoration of the end of the First World War. The trip gives him a chance to brag to other leaders about his midterm victory and, he no doubt expects, to accept their congratulations, their thanks, and their embrace. ♦"]]],"canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"sections":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine","children":[{"id":"592dfa44d5fda942c34a0b61","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"592dfa44d5fda942c34a0b61","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Comment","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"comment"},{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"},{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"}],"name":"Comment","parent":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"},"slug":"comment"}]}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"magazine","contributors":[{"name":"Amy Davidson Sorkin","type":"author","title":"Amy Davidson Sorkin, a \u003cem&gt;New Yorker\u003c/em&gt; staff writer, is a regular contributor to Comment for the magazine and writes a Web \u003ca href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson\"&gt;column\u003c/a&gt;, in which she covers war, sports, and everything in between.","email":"","bio":["div",["p","Amy Davidson Sorkin became a staff writer in 2014.
