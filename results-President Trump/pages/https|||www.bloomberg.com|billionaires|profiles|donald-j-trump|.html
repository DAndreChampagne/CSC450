His other real estate ventures in New York have included the Trump World Tower, Trump Place and the Plaza Hotel. \nHe achieved notoriety in the 1990s for his extramarital affair with Marla Maples, which led him to divorce his wife, Ivana, in 1992.

          <p>Trump's fortune is derived from his ownership of the Trump Organization, a real estate conglomerate and licensing business that owns commercial and residential properties and golf courses in the U.S., Ireland and Scotland. </p>
        
          <p>He controls 30 percent of New York's 1290 6th Ave. and 555 California St. in San Francisco through a partnership with Vornado Realty Trust, and leaseholds at New York's 40 Wall St. and 6 East 57th St. He also owns a penthouse in Trump Tower. These assets are valued using disclosures from Vornado, data from CBRE, DTZ and RCA and other real estate consultants, and financial disclosures compiled by Bloomberg for three of the properties. </p>
        
          <p>About 20 condominiums at 502 Park Ave. in New York are valued using reported sales prices for recently sold units in the building, according to New York City's ACRIS directory. Sixteen golf and resort properties, including the Mar-a-Lago and Trump Doral in Florida, are valued using price-to-sales ratios for similar properties. Debt for these properties is included as a liability. </p>
        
          <p>Trump restructured his business after he was elected president of the U.S. in November 2016 and retains ownership of his assets through a trust managed by his sons, according to comments made by Sheri Dillon, an attorney at Morgan Lewis, at a Jan. 11, 2017, press conference. </p>
        
          <p>His cash investments are valued at the high end of the range filed to the Office of Government Ethics and made public in June 2017. A liability of $520 million is included based on the filing and mortgage documents. Trump said in June 2015 his fortune was $8.7 billion, including $2 billion for the golf and resort properties and $3.3 billion for "brand, branded developments and license agreements." He said in May 2016 that he was worth "more than 10" billion dollars.</p>
