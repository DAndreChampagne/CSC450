class="SectionBreak SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7"></div><div class="SectionBreak SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7"><p>Decades ago, amid the most overt privations of Jim Crow, African-Americans used to tell a joke about a black Harvard professor who moves to the Deep South and tries to register to vote. A white clerk tells him that he will first have to read aloud a paragraph from the Constitution. When he easily does so, the clerk says that he will also have to read and translate a section written in Spanish. Again he complies. The clerk then demands that he read sections in French, German, and Russian, all of which he happens to speak fluently. Finally, the clerk shows him a passage in Arabic. The professor looks at it and says, “My Arabic is rusty, but I believe this translates to ‘Negroes cannot vote in this county.’ ”</p><p>Old jokes have lately been finding renewed salience. Literacy tests, poll taxes, and grandfather clauses, once the most common mechanisms for disadvantaging minority voters, have been consigned to the history books, but one need look no further than the governor’s race in Georgia to see their modern equivalents in action. The race between the Republican, Brian Kemp, Georgia’s secretary of state, and the Democrat, Stacey Abrams, the former minority leader of the state House of Representatives—who, if she wins, will be the first black female governor in the country—is a virtual tie. But Kemp has invoked the so-called exact-match law to suspend fifty-three thousand voter-registration applications, for infractions as minor as a hyphen missing from a surname. African-Americans make up thirty-two per cent of the state’s population, but they represent nearly seventy per cent of the suspended applications. Kemp’s move is particularly questionable given that Abrams’s electoral strategy hinges on mobilizing the six hundred thousand unregistered black voters who have long been seen as the holy grail of Democratic politics in the state.</p><div class="bxc bx-base bx-custom bx-active-step-1 bx-campaign-811003 bx-width-full bx-type-agilityzone bx-has-close-x-1 bx-has-close- bx-fx-fade" id="bx-campaign-811003" style="display: none;

In 2012, after the Asian American Legal Advocacy Center, in Atlanta, discovered that many of its clients who were naturalized citizens were not on the voter rolls, despite having registered, the group raised the issue with Kemp’s office. “In a show of raw intimidation,” Anderson writes, “Kemp ordered an investigation questioning the methods that the organization had used to register new voters.” In 2014, Kemp investigated the New Georgia Project, a voter-registration initiative that Abrams had founded. In a similar vein, officials in Jefferson County last week ordered a group of African-American senior citizens off a bus taking them to an early-voting site, on the ground that the transportation, which had been organized by the nonpartisan group Black Voters Matter, was a “political activity.”</p><p>The events in Georgia are part of a broader political project. The xenophobia and the resentment that Donald Trump stirred up during the 2016 election are fundamentally concerns about the future of the American electorate. (His reported comment that too many people are immigrating from “shithole countries” in Africa and the Caribbean was paired with a lament that not enough are coming from Europe.) He has repeatedly stated that he lost the popular vote because non-citizens voted for Hillary Clinton. Last Thursday, at a rally in Montana, he suggested that Democrats were responsible for a caravan of migrants now heading north from Honduras, because they “figure everybody coming in is going to vote Democrat.” Kemp, likewise, claimed that Abrams wants to let undocumented people vote in Georgia. The suppression of minority votes is the homegrown corollary of this strategy—an attempt to place a white thumb on the demographic scale.</p><p>According to the Brennan Center for Justice, ninety-nine bills designed to diminish voter access were introduced last year in thirty-one state legislatures. Many of the recent Republican-led efforts stem from the Supreme Court’s 2013 decision in Shelby v. Holder. In an opinion that eviscerated the Voting Rights Act of 1965, Chief Justice John Roberts wrote that discrimination still exists, but not sufficiently to warrant the “extraordinary” remediation measures that the act imposed on the states of the former Confederacy. That argument is roughly equivalent to saying that a decline in the prevalence of an infectious disease means that we should stop vaccinating against it. Within hours of the decision, Texas announced a strict new voter-I.D. law. Mississippi and Alabama shortly afterward began enforcing similar laws that previously had been barred.</p><p>The decision added a layer of severity to a voter-access crisis precipitated by state laws that prohibit six million Americans with past convictions from voting. In three Southern states—Florida, Tennessee, and Kentucky—this means that at least twenty per cent of eligible-age African-Americans cannot vote. Meanwhile, North Carolina enacted restrictions on early voting, a policy that particularly affects African-Americans, who are likely to be hourly-wage workers and cannot always get to the polls on Election Day. Last year, the Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal to reinstate a voter-I.D. law in North Carolina that a federal court had found targeted black voters “with almost surgical precision.” In effect, the question posed by Roberts’s ruling is how much discrimination there has to be before you can justify protecting voters.</p><p>Ironically, though, a number of the recent laws validate Roberts’s argument about the undue burden that the Voting Rights Act put on the South; complaints have been lodged in several states that fought for the Union, such as Ohio, Wisconsin, Indiana, and<span data-page="page_final"></span> Iowa, which have passed strict voter-I.D. or roll-purge laws. Earlier this year, in Kansas, a federal judge struck down a law that required voters to provide proof of citizenship to register, championed by Kris Kobach, the secretary of state, who served as a vice-chair of Donald Trump’s short-lived voter-fraud commission and is now running for governor. In North Dakota, which didn’t become a state until twenty-four years after the Civil War, Native Americans must now provide an I.D. that shows a street address—even though many have only a P.O. box.</p><div id="cns-ads-slot-type-article-body-0" class="cns-ads-stage cns-ads-slot-type-article-body cns-ads-slot-type-article-body-0" data-name="article_body_0" data-slot-type="article_body" style="font-size: 0px; line-height: 0; overflow: hidden;"><div id="article_body_0" class="cns-ads-container" data-ad-seq="0" style="margin: 0px auto; box-sizing: content-box;"></div></div><p>The midterm elections are in two weeks. The results will be read as a referendum primarily on Trump’s Presidency, but also on the effectiveness of the electoral restrictions. The old punch line has changed: a professor fluent in five languages no longer need travel south to encounter voter suppression. Voter access is not just a regional crisis; it is a national one. ♦</p></div></div></div></div><footer class="ArticleFooter__footer___3-wlJ"><span class="ArticleDisclaimer__articleDisclaimer___2kCNX">This article appears in the print edition of the October 29, 2018, issue, with the headline “Not Every Vote Counts.”</span><div class="ArticleContributors__bio___3XQjk"><div class="ArticleContributors__contributorWrapper___1CrIJ"><div class="Avatar__avatar___1_uRc ArticleContributors__bioAvatar___11Nu0"><a class="Link__link___3dWao  " href="/contributors/jelani-cobb"><div class="Image__image___1PhYl" role="button" tabindex="0"><picture class="component-responsive-image"><source srcset="https://media.newyorker.com/photos/59097b78ebe912338a37865c/1:1/w_130,c_limit/cobb-jelani.png, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/59097b78ebe912338a37865c/1:1/w_260,c_limit/cobb-jelani.png 2x" /><img alt="" src="https://media.newyorker.com/photos/59097b78ebe912338a37865c/1:1/w_130,c_limit/cobb-jelani.png" title="" /></picture></div></a></div><ul class="ArticleContributors__contributorBios___3_jrJ false"><li><p class="ArticleContributors__contributorBioText___3m1QB">Jelani Cobb is a staff writer at <em>The New Yorker</em> and the author of “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/080271739X/?tag=thneyo0f-20" data-amzn-asin="080271739X">The Substance of Hope: Barack Obama and the Paradox of Progress</a>.”</p><a class="Link__link___3dWao ArticleContributors__contributorBioLink___3ifgZ " href="/contributors/jelani-cobb">Read more »</a></li></ul></div></div><ul class="Tags__tags___1WDCj"><span class="Tags__heading___3sE5b">More:</span><li class="Tags__item___3xh9I"><a class="Link__link___3dWao  " href="/tag/voting">Voting</a></li><li class="Tags__item___3xh9I"><a class="Link__link___3dWao  " href="/tag/georgia">Georgia</a></li><li class="Tags__item___3xh9I"><a class="Link__link___3dWao  " href="/tag/brian-kemp">Brian Kemp</a></li><li class="Tags__item___3xh9I"><a class="Link__link___3dWao  " href="/tag/african-americans">African-Americans</a></li><li class="Tags__item___3xh9I"><a class="Link__link___3dWao  " href="/tag/voting-rights">Voting Rights</a></li><li class="Tags__item___3xh9I"><a class="Link__link___3dWao  " href="/tag/voter-suppression">Voter Suppression</a></li></ul><div class="undefined ArticleFooter__adEndArticle___2_iy_" data-cns="cns-slot-end-of-article"><div id="cns-ads-slot-type-ams-nyr-endofarticletout-0" class="cns-ads-stage cns-ads-slot-type-ams-nyr-endofarticletout cns-ads-slot-type-ams-nyr-endofarticletout-0 cns-ads-slot-state-filled cns-ads-slot-size-710x75" data-name="AMS_NYR_ENDOFARTICLETOUT_0" data-slot-type="AMS_NYR_ENDOFARTICLETOUT" style="font-size: 0px; line-height: 0; overflow: hidden;"><div id="AMS_NYR_ENDOFARTICLETOUT_0" class="cns-ads-container" data-ad-seq="0" data-google-query-id="CM7n-sjsxN4CFVR_fgod9q0B3Q" style="margin: 0px auto; box-sizing: content-box; height: 75px; min-height: 75px; width: 710px; min-width: 710px;"><div id="google_ads_iframe_3379/newyorker.cm/magazine/comment_6__container__" style="border: 0pt none; margin: auto; text-align: center; height: 75px; min-height: 75px; width: 710px; min-width: 710px;"><iframe id="google_ads_iframe_3379/newyorker.cm/magazine/comment_6" title="3rd party ad content" name="google_ads_iframe_3379/newyorker.cm/magazine/comment_6" width="710" height="75" scrolling="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" frameborder="0" srcdoc="" style="border: 0px; vertical-align: bottom; height: 75px; min-height: 75px; width: 710px; min-width: 710px;" data-google-container-id="b"></iframe></div></div></div></div><div class=""><form><section class="NewsletterSubscribe__newsletterComponent___1ZI2a"><p class="NewsletterSubscribe__newsletterDek___29WDu">Never miss a big <i>New Yorker</i> story again.

ago, amid the most overt privations of Jim Crow, African-Americans used to tell a joke about a black Harvard professor who moves to the Deep South and tries to register to vote. A white clerk tells him that he will first have to read aloud a paragraph from the Constitution. When he easily does so, the clerk says that he will also have to read and translate a section written in Spanish. Again he complies. The clerk then demands that he read sections in French, German, and Russian, all of which he happens to speak fluently. Finally, the clerk shows him a passage in Arabic. The professor looks at it and says, “My Arabic is rusty, but I believe this translates to ‘Negroes cannot vote in this county.’ ”"],["p","Old jokes have lately been finding renewed salience. Literacy tests, poll taxes, and grandfather clauses, once the most common mechanisms for disadvantaging minority voters, have been consigned to the history books, but one need look no further than the governor’s race in Georgia to see their modern equivalents in action. The race between the Republican, Brian Kemp, Georgia’s secretary of state, and the Democrat, Stacey Abrams, the former minority leader of the state House of Representatives—who, if she wins, will be the first black female governor in the country—is a virtual tie. But Kemp has invoked the so-called exact-match law to suspend fifty-three thousand voter-registration applications, for infractions as minor as a hyphen missing from a surname. African-Americans make up thirty-two per cent of the state’s population, but they represent nearly seventy per cent of the suspended applications. Kemp’s move is particularly questionable given that Abrams’s electoral strategy hinges on mobilizing the six hundred thousand unregistered black voters who have long been seen as the holy grail of Democratic politics in the state."],["p","Kemp’s acts are singled out for scrutiny in “One Person, No Vote,” a book about modern-day voter suppression, by the historian Carol Anderson. In 2012, after the Asian American Legal Advocacy Center, in Atlanta, discovered that many of its clients who were naturalized citizens were not on the voter rolls, despite having registered, the group raised the issue with Kemp’s office. “In a show of raw intimidation,” Anderson writes, “Kemp ordered an investigation questioning the methods that the organization had used to register new voters.” In 2014, Kemp investigated the New Georgia Project, a voter-registration initiative that Abrams had founded. In a similar vein, officials in Jefferson County last week ordered a group of African-American senior citizens off a bus taking them to an early-voting site, on the ground that the transportation, which had been organized by the nonpartisan group Black Voters Matter, was a “political activity.”"],["p","The events in Georgia are part of a broader political project. The xenophobia and the resentment that Donald Trump stirred up during the 2016 election are fundamentally concerns about the future of the American electorate. (His reported comment that too many people are immigrating from “shithole countries” in Africa and the Caribbean was paired with a lament that not enough are coming from Europe.) He has repeatedly stated that he lost the popular vote because non-citizens voted for Hillary Clinton. Last Thursday, at a rally in Montana, he suggested that Democrats were responsible for a caravan of migrants now heading north from Honduras, because they “figure everybody coming in is going to vote Democrat.” Kemp, likewise, claimed that Abrams wants to let undocumented people vote in Georgia. The suppression of minority votes is the homegrown corollary of this strategy—an attempt to place a white thumb on the demographic scale."],["p","According to the Brennan Center for Justice, ninety-nine bills designed to diminish voter access were introduced last year in thirty-one state legislatures. Many of the recent Republican-led efforts stem from the Supreme Court’s 2013 decision in Shelby v. Holder. In an opinion that eviscerated the Voting Rights Act of 1965, Chief Justice John Roberts wrote that discrimination still exists, but not sufficiently to warrant the “extraordinary” remediation measures that the act imposed on the states of the former Confederacy. That argument is roughly equivalent to saying that a decline in the prevalence of an infectious disease means that we should stop vaccinating against it. Within hours of the decision, Texas announced a strict new voter-I.D. law. Mississippi and Alabama shortly afterward began enforcing similar laws that previously had been barred."],["p","The decision added a layer of severity to a voter-access crisis precipitated by state laws that prohibit six million Americans with past convictions from voting. In three Southern states—Florida, Tennessee, and Kentucky—this means that at least twenty per cent of eligible-age African-Americans cannot vote. Meanwhile, North Carolina enacted restrictions on early voting, a policy that particularly affects African-Americans, who are likely to be hourly-wage workers and cannot always get to the polls on Election Day. Last year, the Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal to reinstate a voter-I.D. law in North Carolina that a federal court had found targeted black voters “with almost surgical precision.” In effect, the question posed by Roberts’s ruling is how much discrimination there has to be before you can justify protecting voters."],["p","Ironically, though, a number of the recent laws validate Roberts’s argument about the undue burden that the Voting Rights Act put on the South; complaints have been lodged in several states that fought for the Union, such as Ohio, Wisconsin, Indiana, and",["inline-embed",{"type":"analytics","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22analytics%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22final%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":""}]," Iowa, which have passed strict voter-I.D. or roll-purge laws. Earlier this year, in Kansas, a federal judge struck down a law that required voters to provide proof of citizenship to register, championed by Kris Kobach, the secretary of state, who served as a vice-chair of Donald Trump’s short-lived voter-fraud commission and is now running for governor. In North Dakota, which didn’t become a state until twenty-four years after the Civil War, Native Americans must now provide an I.D. that shows a street address—even though many have only a P.O. box."],["p","The midterm elections are in two weeks. The results will be read as a referendum primarily on Trump’s Presidency, but also on the effectiveness of the electoral restrictions. The old punch line has changed: a professor fluent in five languages no longer need travel south to encounter voter suppression. Voter access is not just a regional crisis; it is a national one. ♦"]]],"canonicalUrl":"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/10/29/voter-suppression-tactics-in-the-age-of-trump","categories":{"formatting":{"ledeImageLayout":{"id":"5904907fc9e5b50e348ceb2c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5904907fc9e5b50e348ceb2c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Lede Image Layout","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"lede-image-layout"},{"id":"5902aba007071543e751a993","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Formatting","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"formatting"}],"name":"Lede Image Layout","parent":[{"id":"5902aba007071543e751a993","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5902aba007071543e751a993","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Formatting","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"formatting"}],"name":"Formatting","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5902aba007071543e751a993","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Formatting","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"formatting"},"slug":"formatting"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5902aba007071543e751a993","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5902aba007071543e751a993","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Formatting","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"formatting"}],"name":"Formatting","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5902aba007071543e751a993","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Formatting","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"formatting"},"slug":"formatting"},"slug":"lede-image-layout","subcategories":{"ledeImage":"rightAligned"}}},"sections-toc":[{"id":"590411b362471d663d5a94db","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"590411b362471d663d5a94db","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"The Talk of the Town","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"the-talk-of-the-town"},{"id":"5902abaf27562e4d156e37e1","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections -

Abbe was ambushed by color in 2000, while working on an archeological dig in the ancient Greek city of Aphrodisias, in present-day Turkey. At the time, he was a graduate student at New York University’s Institute of Fine Arts, and, like most people, he thought of Greek and Roman statues as objects of pure white marble. The gods, heroes, and nymphs displayed in museums look that way, as do neoclassical monuments and statuary, from the Jefferson Memorial to the Caesar perched outside his palace in Las Vegas."],["p","Aphrodisias was home to a thriving cadre of high-end artists until the seventh century A.D., when an earthquake caused it to fall into ruin. In 1961, archeologists began systematically excavating the city, storing thousands of sculptural fragments in depots. When Abbe arrived there, several decades later, he started poking around the depots and was astonished to find that many statues had flecks of color: red pigment on lips, black pigment on coils of hair, mirrorlike gilding on limbs. For centuries, archeologists and museum curators had been scrubbing away these traces of color before presenting statues and architectural reliefs to the public. “Imagine you’ve got an intact lower body of a nude male statue lying there on the depot floor, covered in dust,” Abbe said. “You look at it up close, and you realize the whole thing is covered in bits of gold leaf. Oh, my God! The visual appearance of these things was just ",["em","totally"]," different from what I’d seen in the standard textbooks—which had only black-and-white plates, in any case.” For Abbe, who is now a professor of ancient art at the University of Georgia, the idea that the ancients disdained bright color “is the most common misconception about Western aesthetics in the history of Western art.” It is, he said, “a lie we all hold dear.”"],["p","In the early nineteen-eighties, Vinzenz Brinkmann had a similar epiphany while pursuing a master’s degree in classics and archeology from Ludwig Maximilian University, in Munich. As part of an effort to determine what kinds of tool marks could be found on Greek marble sculpture, he devised a special lamp that shines obliquely on an object, highlighting its surface relief. When he began scrutinizing sculptures with the lamp, he told me, he “quite immediately understood” that, while there was little sign of tool marks on the statues, there was significant evidence of polychromy—all-over color. He, too, was taken aback by the knowledge that a fundamental aspect of Greek statuary “had been so excluded” from study. He said, “It started as an obsession for me that has never ended.”"],["inline-embed",{"type":"callout","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22callout%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22feature-small%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22image%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522image%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%2522%252Fphotos%252F5bc7acaba3d7f513627ea519%2522%252C%2522width%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522height%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522caption%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%225bc7acaba3d7f513627ea519%5C%22%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%22%2C%22attrs%22%3A%7B%7D%7D","ref":""},["inline-embed",{"type":"image","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22image%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22%2Fphotos%2F5bc7acaba3d7f513627ea519%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":"5bc7acaba3d7f513627ea519"}]],["p","Brinkmann soon realized that his discovery hardly required a special lamp: if you were looking at an ancient Greek or Roman sculpture up close, some of the pigment “was easy to see, even with the naked eye.” Westerners had been engaged in an act of collective blindness. “It turns out that vision is heavily subjective,” he told me. “You need to transform your eye into an objective tool in order to overcome this powerful imprint”—a tendency to equate whiteness with beauty, taste, and classical ideals, and to see color as alien, sensual, and garish."],["p","One afternoon this summer, Marco Leona, who runs the scientific-research department at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, gave me a tour of the Greek and Roman galleries. He pointed out a Greek vase, from the third century B.C., that depicts an artist painting a statue. Leona said, of polychromy, “It’s like the best-kept secret that’s not even a secret.” Jan Stubbe Østergaard, a former curator at the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek museum, in Copenhagen, and the founder of an international research network on polychromy, told me, “Saying you’ve seen these sculptures when you’ve seen only the white marble is comparable to somebody coming from the beach and saying they’ve seen a whale because there was a skeleton on the beach.”"],["p","In the nineteen-nineties, Brinkmann and his wife, Ulrike Koch-Brinkmann, who is an art historian and an archeologist, began re-creating Greek and Roman sculptures in plaster, painted with an approximation of their original colors. Palettes were determined by identifying specks of remaining pigment, and by studying “shadows”—minute surface variations that betray the type of paint applied to the stone. The result of this effort was a touring exhibition called “",["a",{"href":"http://buntegoetter.liebieghaus.de/en"},"Gods in Color."],"” Versions of the show, which was launched in 2003, have been seen by three million museumgoers in twenty-eight cities, including Istanbul and Athens."],["p","The replicas often deliver a shock. A Trojan archer, from approximately 500 B.C., wears tight pants with a harlequin pattern that is as boldly colored as Missoni leggings. A lion that once stood guard over a tomb in Corinth, in the sixth century B.C., has an azurite mane and an ochre body, calling to mind Mayan or Aztec artifacts. There are also reconstructions of naked figures in bronze, which have a disarming fleshiness: copper lips and nipples, luxuriant black beards, wiry swirls of dark pubic hair.

In 2008, Fabio Barry, an art historian who is now at Stanford, complained that a boldly colored re-creation of a statue of the Emperor Augustus at the Vatican Museum looked “like a cross-dresser trying to hail a taxi.” Barry told me, in an e-mail, that he still found the colors unduly lurid: “The various scholars reconstructing the polychromy of statuary always seemed to resort to the most saturated hue of the color they had detected, and I suspected that they even took a sort of iconoclastic pride in this—that the traditional idea of all-whiteness was so cherished that they were going to really make their point that it was colorful.”"],["p","But some of the disorientation among viewers comes from seeing polychromy at all. Østergaard, who put on two exhibitions at the Glyptotek which featured painted reconstructions, said that, to many visitors, the objects “look tasteless.” He went on, “But it’s too late for that! The challenge is for us to try and understand the ancient Greeks and Romans—not to tell them they got it

this obscure academic debate about ancient sculpture has taken on an unexpected moral and political urgency. Last year, a University of Iowa classics professor, Sarah Bond, published two essays, one in the online arts journal ",["a",{"href":"https://hyperallergic.com/383776/why-we-need-to-start-seeing-the-classical-world-in-color/"},"Hyperallergic"]," and one in ",["a",{"href":"https://www.forbes.com/forbes/welcome/?toURL=https://www.forbes.com/sites/drsarahbond/2017/04/27/whitewashing-ancient-statues-whiteness-racism-and-color-in-the-ancient-world/&amp;refURL=http://tny-yoshi.aws.conde.io/issues/20181029/181029fa_fact_talbot/&amp;referrer=http://tny-yoshi.aws.conde.io/issues/20181029/181029fa_fact_talbot/#de3836675ad5"},["em","Forbes"]],", arguing that it was time we all accepted that ancient sculpture was not pure white—and neither were the people of the ancient world. One false notion, she said, had reinforced the other. For classical scholars, it is a given that the Roman Empire—which, at its height, stretched from North Africa to Scotland—was ethnically diverse. In the ",["em","Forbes"]," essay, Bond notes, “Although Romans generally differentiated people on their cultural and ethnic background rather than the color of their skin, ancient sources do occasionally mention skin tone and artists tried to convey the color of their flesh.” Depictions of darker skin can be seen on ancient vases, in small terra-cotta figures, and in the Fayum portraits, a remarkable trove of naturalistic paintings from the imperial Roman province of Egypt, which are among the few paintings on wood that survive from that period. These near-life-size portraits, which were painted on funerary objects, present their subjects with an array of skin tones, from olive green to deep brown, testifying to a complex intermingling of Greek, Roman, and local Egyptian populations. (The Fayum portraits have been widely dispersed among museums.)"],["p","Bond told me that she’d been moved to write her essays when a racist group, Identity Evropa, started putting up posters on college campuses, including Iowa’s, that presented classical white marble statues as emblems of white nationalism. After the publication of her essays, she received a stream of hate messages online. She is not the only classicist who has been targeted by the so-called alt-right. Some white supremacists have been drawn to classical studies out of a desire to affirm what they imagine to be an unblemished lineage of white Western culture extending back to ancient Greece.

The casting decision elicited a backlash in right-wing publications. Online commenters insisted that the “real” Achilles was blond-haired and blue-eyed, and that someone with skin as dark as the actor’s surely would have been a slave. It’s true that Homer describes the hair of Achilles as ",["em","xanthos"],", a word often used to characterize objects that we would call yellow, but Achilles is fictional, so imaginative license in casting seems perfectly acceptable. Moreover, several scholars explained online that, though ancient Greeks and Romans certainly noticed skin color, they did not practice systematic racism. They owned slaves, but this population was drawn from a wide range of conquered peoples, including Gauls and Germans."],["p","Nor did the Greeks conceive of race the way we do. Some of the ancients’ racial theories were derived from the Hippocratic idea of the humors. Rebecca Futo Kennedy, a classicist at Denison University, who writes on race and ethnicity, told me, “Cold weather made you stupid but also courageous, so that was what people from the Far North were supposed to be like. And the people they called Ethiopians were thought of as very smart but cowardly. It comes out of the medical tradition. In the North, you have plenty of thick blood. Whereas, in the South, you’re being desiccated by the sun, and you have to ",["em","think"]," about how to conserve your blood.” Pale skin on a woman was considered a sign of beauty and refinement, because it showed that she was privileged enough not to have to work outdoors. But a man with pale skin was considered unmasculine: bronzed skin was associated with the heroes who fought on battlefields and competed as athletes, naked, in amphitheatres."],["p","In an ",["a",{"href":"https://aeon.co/essays/when-homer-envisioned-achilles-did-he-see-a-black-man"},"essay"]," for the online magazine Aeon, Tim Whitmarsh, a professor of Greek culture at the University of Cambridge, writes that the Greeks “would have been staggered” by the suggestion that they were “white.” Not only do our modern notions of race clash with the thinking of the ancient past; so do our terms for colors, as is clear to anyone who has tried to conceive what a “wine-dark sea” actually looked like. In the Odyssey, Whitmarsh points out, the goddess Athena is said to have restored Odysseus to godlike good looks in this way: “He became black-skinned again and the hairs became blue around his chin.” On the Web site Pharos, which was founded, last year, in part to counter white-supremacist interpretations of the ancient world, a ",["a",{"href":"http://pages.vassar.edu/pharos/2018/05/11/scholars-respond-to-racist-backlash-against-black-achilles-part-1-ancient-greek-attitudes-toward-africans/"},"recent essay"]," notes, “Although there is a persistent, racist preference for lighter skin over darker skin in the contemporary world, the ancient Greeks considered darker skin” for men to be “more beautiful and a sign of physical and moral superiority.”"],["p","Last year, high-school students participating in a summer program at the ",["em",{"class":"small"},"risd"]," Museum, in Providence, were so fascinated to learn about polychromy in classical statuary that they made a coloring book allowing gallery visitors to create brightly hued versions of the objects on display. Christina Alderman, who runs the program, told me, “The moment they found out that the statues were originally painted, I just lost them to that idea. They were, like, ‘Wait, are you serious? I’ve played video games set in ancient times, and all I see are white sculptures.

idealization of white marble is an aesthetic born of a mistake. Over the millennia, as sculptures and architecture were subjected to the elements, their paint wore off. Buried objects retained more color, but often pigments were hidden beneath accretions of dirt and calcite, and were brushed away in cleanings. In the eighteen-eighties, Russell Sturgis, an American art critic, visited the Acropolis, in Athens, and described what happened after objects were unearthed: “The color of all these soon began to fall and vanish. The beautiful statue first described lay on a table in the museum on the Acropolis in May, 1883, and already some of its color had been shaken off; for as it lay it was surrounded by a little deposit of green, red and black powder which had fallen from it.” Paint that survived was sometimes concealed in recesses: between strands of hair, or inside navels, nostrils, and mouths."],["p","In time, though, a fantasy took hold. Scholars argued that Greek and Roman artists had left their buildings and sculptures bare as a pointed gesture—it both confirmed their superior rationality and distinguished their aesthetic from non-Western art. Acceptance of this view was made easier by the fact that ancient Egyptian sculptures looked very different: they tended to retain brilliant surface color, because the dry climate and the sand in which they were interred did not result in the same kind of erosion. But, as Østergaard put it to me, “nobody has a problem hailing Nefertiti as a spectacular piece of world art, and nobody says that it’s unfortunate that it’s painted. Because it’s not Western, it’s perfectly O.K. for it to be polychrome. But let’s not have it in ",["em","our"]," part of the world, because we’re different, aren’t we?”"],["p","Starting in the Renaissance, artists made sculpture and architecture that exalted form over color, in homage to what they thought Greek and Roman art had looked like. In the eighteenth century, Johann Winckelmann, the German scholar who is often called the father of art history, contended that “the whiter the body is, the more beautiful it is,” and that “color contributes to beauty, but it is not beauty.” When the ancient Roman cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum were first excavated, in the mid-eighteenth century, Winckelmann saw some of their artifacts in Naples, and noticed color on them. But he found a way around that discomfiting observation, claiming that a statue of Artemis with red hair, red sandals, and a red quiver strap must have been not Greek but Etruscan—the product of an earlier civilization that was considered less sophisticated. He later concluded, however, that the Artemis probably was Greek. (It is now thought to be a Roman copy of a Greek original.) Østergaard and Brinkmann believe that Winckelmann’s thinking was evolving, and that he might eventually have embraced polychromy, had he not died in 1768, at the age of fifty, after being stabbed by a fellow-traveller at an inn in Trieste."],["p","The cult of unpainted sculpture continued to permeate Europe, buttressing the equation of whiteness with beauty. In Germany, Goethe declared that “savage nations, uneducated people, and children have a great predilection for vivid colors.” He also noted that “people of refinement avoid vivid colors in their dress and the objects that are about them.”"],["inline-embed",{"type":"callout","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22callout%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22feature-small%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22callout%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522callout%2522%252C%2522name%2522%253A%2522group-2%2522%252C%2522body%2522%253A%2522%253Cinline-embed%2520type%253D%255C%2522image%255C%2522%2520meta%253D%255C%2522%25257B%252522type%252522%25253A%252522image%252522%25252C%252522url%252522%25253A%252522%25252Fphotos%25252F5bca5f1d75aaf6710e468dc7%252522%25252C%252522width%252522%25253A%252522%252522%25252C%252522height%252522%25253A%252522%252522%25252C%252522caption%252522%25253A%252522%252522%25257D%255C%2522%2520ref%253D%255C%25225bca5f1d75aaf6710e468dc7%255C%2522%253E%253C%252Finline-embed%253E%253Cinline-embed%2520type%253D%255C%2522image%255C%2522%2520meta%253D%255C%2522%25257B%252522type%252522%25253A%252522image%252522%25252C%252522url%252522%25253A%252522%25252Fphotos%25252F5bca5f1dec3de0785297aa3c%252522%25252C%252522width%252522%25253A%252522%252522%25252C%252522height%252522%25253A%252522%252522%25252C%252522caption%252522%25253A%252522%252522%25257D%255C%2522%2520ref%253D%255C%25225bca5f1dec3de0785297aa3c%255C%2522%253E%253C%252Finline-embed%253E%2522%252C%2522attrs%2522%253A%257B%257D%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%22%5C%22%3E%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22image%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522image%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%2522%252Fphotos%252F5bca5f1d75aaf6710e468dc7%2522%252C%2522width%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522height%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522caption%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%225bca5f1d75aaf6710e468dc7%5C%22%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22image%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522image%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%2522%252Fphotos%252F5bca5f1dec3de0785297aa3c%2522%252C%2522width%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522height%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522caption%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%225bca5f1dec3de0785297aa3c%5C%22%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%22%2C%22attrs%22%3A%7B%7D%7D","ref":""},["inline-embed",{"type":"callout","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22callout%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22group-2%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22image%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522image%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%2522%252Fphotos%252F5bca5f1d75aaf6710e468dc7%2522%252C%2522width%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522height%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522caption%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%225bca5f1d75aaf6710e468dc7%5C%22%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22image%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522image%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%2522%252Fphotos%252F5bca5f1dec3de0785297aa3c%2522%252C%2522width%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522height%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522caption%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%225bca5f1dec3de0785297aa3c%5C%22%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%22%2C%22attrs%22%3A%7B%7D%7D","ref":""},["inline-embed",{"type":"image","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22image%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22%2Fphotos%2F5bca5f1d75aaf6710e468dc7%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":"5bca5f1d75aaf6710e468dc7"}],["inline-embed",{"type":"image","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22image%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22%2Fphotos%2F5bca5f1dec3de0785297aa3c%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":"5bca5f1dec3de0785297aa3c"}]]],["p","In the nineteenth century, a series of major excavations should have toppled the monochrome myth. In Rome, the architect Gottfried Semper used scaffolding to examine Trajan’s Column, and reported finding myriad traces of color. Victorian excavations of the Acropolis turned up some painted reliefs, sculptures, and marble gutters. The Augustus of Prima Porta and the Alexander Sarcophagus retained bold hues when they were discovered, as contemporaneous paintings of them confirm."],["p","In a catalogue essay for an 1892 exhibition at the Art Institute of Chicago, the classical scholar Alfred Emerson said of polychromy that “literary testimony and the evidence of archeology are too strong and uniform to admit of quibble or doubt.” Nevertheless, Emerson continued, “so strong was the deference for the Antique, learned from the Italian masters of the Renaissance, that the accidental destruction of the ancient coloring” had been “exalted into a special merit, and ridiculously associated with the ideal qualities of the highest art”—from “lofty serenity” to “unsullied purity.”"],["p","This ardor for whiteness was so intense that the evidence didn’t stand a chance. Scholars who continued to discuss polychromy were often dismissed. Auguste Rodin is supposed to have pounded his chest and said, “I feel it ",["em","here"]," that they were never colored.” Sculpture and painting had become increasingly independent disciplines, and artists who tried to merge the two were met with scorn. In the eighteen-fifties, when the British artist John Gibson, a proponent of polychromy, showed his delicate “Tinted Venus”—the goddess’s body is mostly white, but she has muted golden hair and cornflower-blue eyes—a titillated reviewer described the figure as “a naked, impudent Englishwoman.”"],["p","As the artist and critic David Batchelor writes in his 2000 book, “",["a",{"href":"https://www.amazon.com/Chromophobia-Focus-Contemporary-Issues-Batchelor/dp/1861890745"},"Chromophobia"],",” at a certain point ignorance becomes willful denial—a kind of “negative hallucination” in which we refuse to see what is before our eyes. Mark Abbe, who has become the leading American scholar of ancient Greek and Roman polychromy, believes that, when such a delusion persists, you have to ask yourself, “",["em","Cui bono"],"?”—“Who benefits?” He told me, “If we weren’t benefitting, we wouldn’t be so invested in it. We benefit from a whole range of assumptions about cultural, ethnic, and racial superiority. We benefit in terms of the core identity of Western civilization, that sense of the West as more rational—the Greek miracle and all that. And I’m not saying there’s no truth to the idea that something singular happened in Greece and Rome, but we can do better and see the ancient past on a broader cultural horizon.”"],["p","In the twentieth century, appreciation for ancient polychromy and decoration went further into eclipse—largely on aesthetic, rather than racial, grounds. Modernism lauded the abstraction of white forms and derided earthy verisimilitude in sculpture. In a 1920 essay titled “Purism,” the architect Le Corbusier wrote, “Let us leave to the clothes-dyers the sensory jubilation of the paint tube.” In Italy and Germany, Fascist artists created white marble statuary of idealized bodies. After the Second World War, European architects sought a neutral common heritage by promoting the modest virtues of spare white spaces, such as the parliamentary building in Bonn."],["p","Over the centuries, many art restorers and dealers felt obliged to vigorously scrub Greek and Roman objects, so as to enhance their marmoreal gleam—and their collectibility. Mark Bradley, a classicist at the University of Nottingham, believes that in some cases restorers were merely trying to remove residue left by oil lamps that had lit galleries before the advent of electricity. But, he noted in an e-mail, many museums propagated “an enduring Renaissance conspiracy” to “eradicate traces of paint.” In the nineteen-thirties, restorers at the British Museum polished the Elgin

day in July, Abbe was in Bloomington, Indiana, peering at two Roman busts: one of the militaristic Emperor Septimius Severus and one of his learned wife, Julia Domna. The busts belong to Indiana University’s Eskenazi Museum, which is closed for renovation, and Abbe was examining them in a storage facility. The sculptures, made from a creamy white marble, appeared to have negligible speckles and stains. But Abbe knew better. He had examined their surfaces with a powerful microscope and with infrared and UV light, and had discovered rich purples, blues, and pinks."],["p","In 2007, Giovanni Verri, who now teaches conservation at the Courtauld Institute, in London, figured out how to confirm the presence of an ancient pigment known as Egyptian blue.

Ancient organic dyes—such as Tyrian purple, made from the glands of sea snails—are harder to identify, but scholars have had some success using surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy, which measures molecular vibrations.

He gave me one to put on; it looked like a dorky version of a miner’s lamp. “I try to convince everyone that they need to buy these for when they go to museums,” he said.

And then they’re washing that over with a paint pigment that seems to have a number of elements—it seems to have Egyptian blue in it, and it seems to have a mercury-rich red pigment, probably cinnabar. That’s a good example of how they’re layering.”"],["p","Abbe and Van Voorhis are interested in finding out not just which colors the ancients favored but what techniques they used to apply paint: how sculptors polished stone surfaces in preparation for pigment, how they added highlights and shading to faces. Learning more about these methods will help scholars create more nuanced facsimiles, and will also illuminate how painting and sculpting worked in tandem in the ancient world. Skeptics of polychromy question why Greek and Roman artists would have sculpted with such beautiful materials—Parian marble, which was commonly used, has a prized translucence—and then painted over the surface, or bedazzled it with gilt and jewels. But if painters and sculptors worked together as partners, with an understanding of how tactically applied color could enhance a work’s luminosity, polychromy makes more aesthetic sense."],["p","Abbe said, “We have this wonderful anecdote from Praxiteles, the Greek sculptor from the fourth century B.C. When he’s asked which of his sculptures he liked the best, he names those that the premier painter of the day, Nicias, ‘applied his hand to.’ ” He noted that, in the ancient Roman Empire, statues would not have been sequestered in art galleries—they would have been on the streets and in people’s homes. Figures that were deftly painted would have looked eerily lifelike, particularly in low and flickering light. “There’s a real aesthetic, especially in the Roman period, for the visual trick,” he said. “When you went into a place, the divide between what was sculpture and what was actual life was fluid, and highly theatrical. You go to a dinner party in Pompeii, and there are statues of nude homoerotic youths, in the old, noble Greek tradition. And then there are actual slave boys that look just like those well-tanned bronzes, and at first they’re standing still. And then they move, the same way the sculptures seem to move in the reflections of pools and fountains.

At times, he added, the impulse to clean is less about a dislike of color and more about “the excitement of discovery”: “You want to see what you’ve got. Archeology is a slow business. Then, imagine, it’s the last day, and you finally find something. The first thing you want to do is make it legible.” This impulse, he said, must be checked: “You should treat a discovery like a medical situation. Treat it like triage. What you want to do is stabilize the patient. Less is more. Take the thing, wrap it up in something like neutral cotton gauze, and put it on a shelf in a stable place. Then call us, and we will come and do the micro-excavation of the surface.” This process needs to happen relatively quickly, because, after extraction, the soil clinging to an object dries, and “the paint layers literally delaminate with it,” leaving a denuded object and “a painting in reverse” adhering to scattered flakes of soil."],["p","As we examined the bust of Julia, Van Voorhis pointed out a tendril of hair peeking out from under her wig. This made it clear that she was wearing the wig for fashion, not to cover up baldness. Her face was so carefully modelled that you could see where her cheek was beginning to sag slightly. She had horizontal creases encircling her neck—Venus rings, I learned they were called—and a delightful unibrow, both of which connoted desirability. All this humanizing detail had been conveyed purely through form. I wondered if Abbe ever regretted having to see such sculptures, in his mind’s eye, saturated in the bright colors that many people find kitschy."],["p","The first time I saw a statue that had been painted to approximate ancient polychromy, I was in Nashville, of all places. In 1897, a full-scale replica of the Parthenon was erected in a city park there, and inside it is an enormous statue of Athena. To my eye, the figure, which was painted and gilded in the two-thousands, looked awful: her golden robes had a blinding shimmer, her eyes were a doll-like blue, and her lips could have beckoned from a lipstick ad. It reminded me of a Jeff Koons piece that revels in its tackiness. Yet Abbe assured me that the colorized Athena was consistent with the aesthetics of the lost original, from the fifth century B.C."],["p","Some of the painted replicas that I saw subsequently seemed more subtle and persuasive.

how should we represent the colors of the classical world in museums? The reality-television, big-reveal style of the “Gods in Color” exhibition is certainly effective at upending our preconceptions. As Østergaard said, “A physical object right next to an original gives the public a real ‘Aha!’ moment. It’s spectacularly successful as a means of communication.”"],["p","But Abbe, like many scholars I talked to, wasn’t crazy about the reconstructions in “Gods in Color.” He found the hues too flat and opaque, and noted that plaster, which most of the replicas are made from, absorbs paint in a way that marble does not. He was also bothered by the fact that the statues “all look fundamentally the same, whereas styles would have differed enormously.”"],["p","The Brinkmanns have made several replicas in synthetic and real marble—an expensive undertaking—and these do reflect light somewhat better than the plaster models. Cecilie Brøns, who currently heads a project at the Glyptotek called Tracking Colour, which is investigating all the museum’s ancient pieces for traces of color, admires the Brinkmanns’ reconstructions but said she worries that museumgoers accept them too literally. The replicas were best appreciated as interpretations, she said, adding, “Reconstructions can be difficult to explain to the public—that these are not exact copies, that we can never know exactly how they looked.”"],["p","Giovanni Verri, of the Courtauld Institute, told me, “Knowing the particular pigments and the painting materials is useful, but it’s not the sum of the painting. There is the technique component—the style, the sensibility.” To paint exactly as an ancient painter did would require a psychic form of time travel. “We have so much knowledge that those painters would not have had,” he said. “We have experienced two thousand years of history, and art history, that would be extremely difficult to forget.”"],["inline-embed",{"type":"video","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22video%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FgRMPYh2QdSM%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22100%25%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22380%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":""}],["p","Verri, like Abbe and others in the field, believes that digital reproductions—computer animations and the like—can offer advantages that physical ones do not. They can be revised as new information becomes available, and they can also show multiple possibilities of how an object might have looked. Verri created such a digital reproduction a few years ago, after he spent time investigating the traces of polychromy on the Treu Head—an idealized female figure, sculpted in the second century A.D., that is in the collection of the British Museum. Verri performed what he called “a digital face transplant.” He identified pigments that had originally covered the sculpture: Egyptian blue mixed into pinkish skin tones and the whites of the eyes; yellow and red ochre in the hair; rose-colored madder lake for the lips. He also studied and mimicked the sophisticated painting techniques used in the Fayum portraits. The result is refined and naturalistic."],["p","When the Eskenazi Museum reopens, in a year or two, it will host a special exhibition featuring the busts of Severus and Julia. To show the original polychromy, Abbe and Van Voorhis have considered projecting colored light on the statues for part of the day. (A set of friezes at the Ara Pacis museum, in Rome, have been presented this way, to pleasing effect.) Another idea is to present a video animation in which the color gradually appears on the two Roman busts, suggesting how successive layers of paint might have been applied."],["p","Abbe and Van Voorhis will have to engage in some speculation, particularly when it comes to hair color and skin tone. They have no reason to believe that there wasn’t pigment on the skin or hair of the busts, but they have not found any traces of it. “The absence of evidence is not evidence of absence,” Abbe wrote to me, in an e-mail. “Classic neoclassical assumption!”"],["p","Later, in another e-mail, Abbe pointed out that much of the Roman élite “came from diverse-looking stock—Berber, Arab, Transylvanian, Danubian, Spanish, etc.” He also noted that sculptures of African people from the ancient world were sometimes carved from black stones, such as basalt, and then painted with reddish-brown pigments to create a lifelike effect. One such example, at the Museum für Kunst und Gewerbe, in Hamburg, is the head of a young boy, from the first century B.C.; patches of mahogany-colored paint can still be seen on the nose and the cheeks."],["p","Severus and Julia were Romans, but neither was of Italic descent. Severus was of Berber origin, from an élite family in Libya. Julia came from a priestly family in Emesa, Syria. A panel painting of the couple, known as the Berlin Tondo, has survived: Severus has a chestnut-brown complexion and a grizzled gray beard; Julia is paler, with dark hair and eyes. The Tondo will help guide Abbe and Van Voorhis in their work on the busts, just as the Fayum portraits aided Verri."],["p","The easiest, and cheapest, way for museums to address the fact of polychromy is to say more about it in their labelling. One day in July, Gina Borromeo, the curator of ancient art at the ",["em",{"class":"small"},"risd"]," Museum, walked me through the Greek and Roman galleries, and pointed out a label that she’d written in 2009: “The surviving traces of reddish pigment, still visible in the hair of this figure, reflect the fact that most ancient statues were originally quite vividly painted.” But Borromeo believes that nothing can match the power of displaying a polychrome work that has retained its original hues. In 2016, she successfully lobbied to acquire an Etruscan urn that still has much of its original color."],["p","Vinzenz Brinkmann, who now heads the antiquities department of the Liebieghaus sculpture collection, in Frankfurt, told me that viewing classical sculptures in color does far more than expand your notion of what such objects originally looked like; it helps you understand that “everything that seems to be so clearly and firmly set is not always so clearly and firmly set.” In other words, he said, seeing these colors affects people’s understanding of themselves. With a small chuckle, he added, “And, for us, this is beautiful.” ♦"]]],"canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"sections":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"},"slug":"magazine","children":[{"id":"5907f0bec14b3c606c1027e8","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5907f0bec14b3c606c1027e8","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Onward and Upward with the Arts","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"onward-and-upward-with-the-arts"},{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"},{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"}],"name":"Onward and Upward with the Arts","parent":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"},"slug":"onward-and-upward-with-the-arts"}]}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"magazine","contentTags":[],"contentType":"article","contributors":[{"name":"Margaret Talbot","type":"author","title":"Margaret Talbot is a staff writer and the author of “\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/1594631883/?tag=thneyo0f-20\"&gt;The Entertainer: Movies, Magic and My Father’s Twentieth Century\u003c/a&gt;.”","email":"","bio":["div",["p","Margaret Talbot joined ",["em","The New Yorker"]," as a staff writer in 2003.\nPreviously, she was a contributing writer at the New York ",["em","Times\nMagazine"]," and, from 1995 to 1999, an editor at ",["em","The New Republic."]," Her\nstories, covering legal issues, social policy, and popular culture, have\nappeared, in addition to in the ",["em","Times Magazine"]," and ",["em","The New\nRepublic,"]," in ",["em","The Atlantic Monthly, National Geographic,"]," and\nthe ",["em","Times Book Review"],".

Born in 1841, Morisot first showed at the Paris Salon in 1864—initially with works influenced by teachers she had, chiefly the Barbizon master Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot—and figured prominently in all the annual Impressionist exhibitions, from 1874 to 1886, except that of 1879, when she was too ill, after the birth of her only child, Julie, to participate. Manet kept three of her paintings in his bedroom. She was a painter’s painter, but only by default. Today, she is the most interesting artist of her generation, for feats of form and depths of meaning that were still developing when she died from pneumonia, in 1895, at the age of fifty-four. She is due for full-blown fame.

You see the distinction in her pictures of fashionably dressed Parisiennes, who are not spectacles but bodily presences in dresses that feel rendered from the inside. Rather than look at these women, you adduce what it’s like to be them. Even Morisot’s semi-nudes, painted from models, radiate selfhood, defying objectification. She achieves this effect with intricate and fast brushwork that yields porous, tactile surfaces that absorb the eye and stir sensations of touch. She had the loosest, least finished-looking of Impressionist techniques—a trait that helps explain her neglect, versus the more decisively branded manners of the men, but one that also fascinates. Her paintings, indefinite at first glance, are hard to stop contemplating once you’ve started.

Her upper-middle-class family (her father was a former architect and a highly placed civil servant, her mother a distant relative of the rococo painter Jean-Honoré Fragonard) enthusiastically supported her vocation and that of an older sister, Edma. Their parents built a studio for the two girls and enabled them to study with a number of leading artists—crucially Corot, who praised them both (Edma especially). Berthe and Edma served each other as soul mates and, perhaps, when not accompanied by their mother, as mutual chaperones in a nearly all-male art world. Early in the Barnes show, there is an astonishingly strong portrait by Edma (circa 1865) of Berthe painting; she captured her sister in an attitude that strikes me as at once unconfident and unstoppable. Those qualities persisted after 1869, when Edma gave up serious painting to marry a naval officer and moved away from Paris. Berthe was prone throughout her life to self-doubt, and she destroyed many of her works. But she never ceased to push the limits of her ability, seeking sweet spots of personal satisfaction and aesthetic power. Although she had no need of money, she did well in the marketing of her art. Her breakthrough from unadventurous early styles came when she met Édouard Manet, in 1868, and quickly grasped the revolutionary import of his way with paint."],["inline-embed",{"type":"callout","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22callout%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22feature-small%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22image%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522image%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%2522%252Fphotos%252F5bc8fd572c734e2cee06b714%2522%252C%2522width%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522height%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522caption%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%225bc8fd572c734e2cee06b714%5C%22%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%22%2C%22attrs%22%3A%7B%7D%7D","ref":""},["inline-embed",{"type":"image","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22image%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22%2Fphotos%2F5bc8fd572c734e2cee06b714%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":"5bc8fd572c734e2cee06b714"}]],["p","There’s abundant suspicion that Morisot and Manet were in love with each other. His many paintings of her, beginning with “The Balcony” (1868), in which she sits in a white dress behind a green railing, as much as say simply, again and again, “There she is.” She returns his gaze, when she does, with unreadable aplomb. But he was married, and she was careful. In 1874, at the age of thirty-three—late for a woman of that period—she married his younger brother Eugène, forty-one, and a painter, who then set his own career aside to support hers. Eugène appears in her subsequent work as a mild, nice man, at times playing with their daughter, Julie. Morisot painted outdoors when she could, a dicey practice at a time when respectable, unaccompanied women passed their lives under what amounted to house arrest—she was liable to be stared at by passersby and flocked by children. There’s a harbor scene in the show, from 1869, which Manet pronounced a masterpiece—whereupon she made him a gift of it. But the curators—from the Barnes and from museums in Paris, Montreal, and Dallas—concentrate on the portraits and the figurative works that constitute most of her œuvre, while featuring hybrid pictures of interiors with blazing views of the outside world through large windows. By historical good fortune for Morisot, the bourgeois home was becoming a socially and psychologically charged arena for artistic exploration."],["inline-embed",{"type":"callout","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22callout%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22feature-small%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22image%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522image%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%2522%252Fphotos%252F5bc8fd56d0b12f2ceffc04ff%2522%252C%2522width%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522height%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522caption%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%225bc8fd56d0b12f2ceffc04ff%5C%22%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%22%2C%22attrs%22%3A%7B%7D%7D","ref":""},["inline-embed",{"type":"image","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22image%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22%2Fphotos%2F5bc8fd56d0b12f2ceffc04ff%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":"5bc8fd56d0b12f2ceffc04ff"}]],["p","In “The Cradle” (1872), Edma, head propped on hand, pensively regards her sleeping baby through a white veil. The mood is tender but subtly tense. The new mother is transfixed but tired. She may be wondering what she has let herself in for. All Morisot’s treatments of mothers and children, and of children alone, are affectionate enough, but without so much as a whisper of sentimentality. Even her infants register as separate creatures, though years short of being aware of it. (Are they cute? They can’t not be.) In “Cottage Interior” (1886), an eight-year-old Julie focusses intently on the doll that she holds as she stands oblivious of a lovely view of a harbor through a window to her right and, to her left, a large table set for breakfast. (Morisot had planned to paint Eugène at the table, but decided against it.) A knockout portrait of red-haired Julie at sixteen, in 1894, takes apparent inspiration from the Symbolist painters who were then on the rise, notably ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/02/29/edvard-munch-at-the-neue-galerie"},"Edvard Munch"],", to vivify a slightly sullen, alarmingly beautiful teen-ager. The hint of a new emotional audacity in Morisot’s art, with colors that sizzle and lines that whip, makes her death, in 1895, painfully untimely.

But, aside from a few partial failures that instructively exemplify risks Morisot took, they are all more than museum-worthy. Morisot is still emerging from the margins of the Impressionist club of certified alphas, betas, and minions, but the priority for valuing her work is not just the issuing of retroactive membership. It’s re-seeing and rethinking the whole history of modern art from the perspective of women who never stood a chance of major attainment. In a different world, Morisot would be the doyenne of an established tradition that built and expanded on her example. Her subsequent avatars were discontinuous until recently.

Men have held forth at relative liberty for a few thousand years. They may continue to impress, but they are considerably less likely to surprise than a class of creators whose testimony, with exceptions mainly in literature, has tended to be patronized even when heeded. Let all canons fall until we have this imbroglio sorted out. How does the past century and a half of art register if, as an experiment, we set Berthe Morisot at center stage and look around from there?

he’s at work, at the Tower of London, Yeoman Warder Christopher Skaife typically wears a uniform featuring a royal-blue tabard with scarlet ornamentation, a brass-buckled belt, and a bonnet. (Formalwear involves stockings and a ruff.) Skaife lives at the Tower, too, with his wife, in a house with forty-foot walls and arrow slits for windows. Skaife is the Tower’s Ravenmaster—his new book, “",["a",{"href":"https://www.amazon.com/Ravenmaster-Life-Ravens-Tower-London/dp/0374113343"},"The Ravenmaster,"],"” just came out—and in that role he cares for its most famous current residents, Merlin (a.k.a. Merlina), Erin, Rocky, Jubilee II, Gripp II, Harris, and Poppy, and gives tours to some of the Tower’s three million annual visitors. Recently, while vacationing in Manhattan, Skaife, who is Beefeater-shaped, with a bristly beard, was incognito, dressed in a zippered jacket and cargo shorts. He has tattoos on his calves depicting ravens, as well as, he said, “the skulls of those who were executed on the Tower Green.” On a crisp Friday, Skaife met up with his friend Gabriel Willow, a trim man in a cap, who works with New York City Audubon, to embark on a raven quest."],["p","After a long absence, ravens have returned to the metro area: about six pairs nest in or around New York City. Willow and Skaife visited three potential hot spots—Pelham Bay Park, in the Bronx (mallards, cormorants, egrets; no ravens), far West Twenty-third Street, and Inwood Hill Park, at the northernmost tip of Manhattan. At West Twenty-third and the Hudson River, Skaife and Willow peered through binoculars. “I did see a raven this morning up in Central Park—a big flyby,” Willow said. “I heard cawing and calling, and a murder of crows swirled around, chasing a raven.”"],["p","“Crows can be quite vicious, and quite territorial,” Skaife said. He has a Cockney accent—“fevvers” for “feathers,” and the like. “One of our ravens mimics crows,” he said: Merlina, one of “The Ravenmaster” ’s most entertaining characters. “When I let her out in the morning, sometimes she’ll make the crow sound, to attract crows to play with her. She shares food as well.” Willow asked what Tower ravens eat. “Mice, rats, day-old chicks, dog biscuits soaked in blood, and anything they can steal from the public,” Skaife replied. Some ravens mimic humans. “We had one raven once who said ‘Good morning’ to ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/vladimir-putin"},"Vladimir Putin"],",” Skaife went on. “He was quite taken aback.”"],["p","They scanned the Hudson—blue jays, gulls, and monarch butterflies, but no ravens. They headed east, to catch a cab. At the corner of Eleventh Avenue, Willow looked up. “Turkey vultures!” he said."],["p","A construction worker in a hard hat was waiting to cross the street. He looked up, too. “Get out of here!” he shouted. “They fly around when someone’s dead, right?”"],["p","“They may or may not see anything dead—they might just be moving through,” Willow said."],["p","“Sometimes bird-watching just ",["em","happens"],",” the construction worker said."],["p","Skaife sat in the front seat of the taxi to Inwood. “You’re wearing shorts?” the driver asked. His name was Mohammed Ali."],["p","“I come from England, and in England this is warm,” Skaife told him. They chatted, and Skaife mentioned living at the Tower of London."],["p","“That’s where you have seven ravens, right?”"],["p","“Yes, and I’m—”"],["p","“One of them is gone, do you know that?”"],["p","“No, it’s ",["em","not"],", because I’m their ",["em","keeper!"],"” Skaife said, laughing."],["p","“That’s the fall of England, isn’t it?” Ali said."],["p","“If the ravens leave the Tower of London, it will crumble into dust and great harm will befall our kingdom,” Skaife said. (According to Skaife, this legend was invented around 1880, by the Tower itself. “Marketing,” he explained.) “So I’ve come over here to steal some of yours.”"],["p","“Take as many as you want,” Ali said. “Ravens—those bastards never forget! In Bangladesh, every time one of them saw me it would dive on my head.” He asked about the Crown Jewels, also resident at the Tower. “Don’t you have our diamond?” he said. (The Koh-i-Noor, one of the largest cut diamonds in the world, was “ceded” to Queen Victoria in 1849.)"],["p","“We ",["em","kind"]," of have it,” Skaife said."],["p","“My God, man, when are you going to return it?” Ali said."],["p","In the park, Willow pointed out mugwort and a pokeweed bush teeming with goldfinches. At a brackish inlet of the Harlem River, Skaife spotted a kestrel. They hiked into the woods, past a boulder commemorating the 1626 “purchase” of Manhattan from the Lenape, and up a paved incline, alongside the Hudson. Willow identified tufted titmice and yellow-rumped warblers, and Skaife talked about Brân the Blessed, whose head, according to legend, is buried beneath the Tower.

The complex sat on Montrose, just across from St. Thomas. They rented it from a woman who couldn’t be bothered with a lease, or regular maintenance, or even a deposit; Rod had talked her down so that she wouldn’t raise the charges on them. Rod was the one who spent the least time fucking around. He was always out tricking. Most of them were. But, on the rare mornings Poke awoke on the fading carpet of the room, he could watch crowds from the chapel drifting up the block. The apartment was next to the Chevron on Richmond and the pharmacy on Yoakum, with the diner in between, and Poke would hover by the window, humming at the sink, willing the tap into something a little nicer."],["p","Usually he was cleaning up from last night’s john. Poke tried to keep things local. It made life easier. Most guys were fine getting jerked off in their cars, or driving Poke and the other boys a block from the bars on Fairview—but others insisted that they had to be comfortable, and these were the ones who took Poke home with them."],["p","Although, once, Poke ended up at Memorial Hermann.

Larry Krasner entered the race for District Attorney of Philadelphia last year, he had never prosecuted a case. He began his career as a public defender, and spent three decades as a defense attorney. In the legal world, there is an image, however cartoonish, of prosecutors as conservative and unsparing, and of defense attorneys as righteous and perpetually outraged. Krasner, who had a long ponytail until he was forty, seemed to fit the mold. As he and his colleagues engaged in daily combat with the D.A.’s office, they routinely complained about prosecutors who, they believed, withheld evidence that they were legally required to give to the defense; about police who lied under oath on the witness stand; and about the D.A. Lynne Abraham, a Democrat whose successful prosecutions, over nearly twenty years, sent more people to death row than those of any other D.A. in modern Philadelphia history."],["p","In 1993, Krasner opened his own law firm, and went on to file more than seventy-five lawsuits against the police, alleging brutality and misconduct. In 2013, he represented Askia Sabur, who had been charged with robbing and assaulting a police officer. A cell-phone video of the incident, which had gone viral, showed that it was the police who had beaten Sabur, on a West Philadelphia sidewalk. Daniel Denvir, a former criminal-justice reporter at the Philadelphia ",["em","City Paper"]," and a friend of Krasner’s, recalled that, at the trial, Krasner revealed the unreliability of the officers’ testimony, “methodically unspooling their lies in front of the jury.” In dealing with such cases, Denvir said, Krasner sought to illustrate “prosecutors’ and judges’ typical credulity with regard to anything that a police officer said, no matter how improbable.” (Krasner later filed a civil lawsuit on Sabur’s behalf, which was settled for eight hundred and fifty thousand dollars. The police officers were never charged with lying on the witness stand.)"],["p","In Krasner’s spare time, he worked pro bono, representing members of ",["em",{"class":"small"},"ACT UP"],", Occupy Philadelphia, and Black Lives Matter. In 2001, his wife, Lisa Rau, decided to run for state-court judge. Krasner asked some of the activists he had represented, including Kate Sorensen, of ",["em",{"class":"small"},"ACT UP"],", for help. “We were involved with a whole community of anarchist activists—folks who generally don’t vote,” Sorensen said, “but we got hundreds and hundreds of lawn signs up all over the city.” Rau won, and later earned a reputation for challenging questionable testimony from the police."],["p","In early 2017, when Krasner told the six-person staff of his firm that he was running for D.A., they erupted in laughter. On February 8th, he announced his candidacy with a speech in which he attacked the culture of the D.A.’s office, accusing prosecutors of embracing “bigger, meaner mandatory sentencing.” He accused the office, too, of casting a “very wide net,” which had “brought black and brown people from less prosperous neighborhoods into the system when that was in fact unnecessary and destructive.”"],["p","The president of the police union pronounced Krasner’s candidacy “hilarious.” Krasner received no mainstream-newspaper endorsements and, at first, was supported by only a few Democratic elected officials. He seemed to please almost no one in power––certainly not those in the office he hoped to lead, which has had its troubles in recent years. In 2017, the D.A. at the time, Seth Williams, was accused of accepting gifts, including a trip to a resort in Punta Cana, and later pleaded guilty to bribery, and was sent to federal prison. But few people saw Krasner as the solution. Twelve former prosecutors, nearly all of whom had worked under Williams, wrote a letter that was published in the Philadelphia ",["em","Citizen:"]," “While it might be demoralizing to work for someone who is federally indicted, imagine working for someone who has openly demonized what you do every day,” it read. “Why work for someone that reviles a career you are passionate about?”"],["p","Krasner, who is fifty-seven, is a compact man with an intense, slightly mischievous demeanor. He likes to say that he wrote his campaign platform—eliminate cash bail, address police misconduct, end mass incarceration—on a napkin. “Some of us had been in court four and five days a week in Philadelphia County for thirty years,” he said. “We had watched this car crash happen in slow motion.” Krasner often talks about how, running as a defense attorney, his opponents, most of whom had worked as prosecutors in the D.A.’s office, frequently attacked him for having no experience. At one event, they were “beating the tar out of me because I have not been a prosecutor. ‘Oh, my God! He’s never been a prosecutor!’ ” But the line of attack worked to his advantage. “You could hear people saying, ‘that’s good!’ ” Brandon Evans, a thirty-five-year-old political organizer, said. “I remember people nodding profusely, rolling their eyes, and shrugging their shoulders.”"],["p","In 2015, Philadelphia had the highest incarceration rate of America’s ten largest cities. As its population grew more racially diverse and a new generation became politically active, its “tough on crime” policies fell further out of synch with its residents’ views. During Krasner’s campaign, hundreds of people—activists he had represented, supporters of Bernie Sanders, Black Lives Matter leaders, former prisoners—knocked on tens of thousands of doors on his behalf. Michael Coard, a left-wing critic of the city’s criminal-justice system, wrote in the Philadelphia ",["em","Tribune"]," that Krasner was the “blackest white guy I know.” The composer and musician John Legend, a University of Pennsylvania graduate, tweeted an endorsement. In the three weeks before the primary, a ",["em",{"class":"small"},"PAC"]," funded by the liberal billionaire George Soros spent $1.65 million on pro-Krasner mailers and television ads. Strangers started recognizing him on the street. He trounced his six opponents in the primary, and went on to win the general election, on November 7, 2017, with seventy-five per cent of the vote. He was sworn in on January 1, 2018, by his wife."]],["inline-embed",{"type":"section","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22section%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cp%3EIn%20the%20past%20ten%20years%2C%20violent%20crime%20across%20the%20country%20has%20fallen%2C%20but%2C%20according%20to%20polls%2C%20many%20people%20continue%20to%20believe%20that%20it%20has%20increased.%20President%20Trump%E2%80%99s%20campaign%20exploited%20the%20fear%20of%20%E2%80%9CAmerican%20carnage%2C%E2%80%9D%20and%20the%20criminal-justice%20system%20of%20the%20United%20States%2C%20which%20has%20the%20highest%20incarceration%20rate%20in%20the%20world%2C%20seems%20built%20on%20this%20misinformation.%20And%20yet%2C%20at%20a%20local%20level%2C%20there%20are%20signs%20of%20change.%20Krasner%20is%20one%20of%20about%20two%20dozen%20%E2%80%9Cprogressive%20prosecutors%2C%E2%80%9D%20many%20of%20them%20backed%20by%20Soros%2C%20who%20have%20won%20recent%20district-attorney%20races.%20In%202016%2C%20Aramis%20Ayala%20got%20early%20support%20from%20Shaquille%20O%E2%80%99Neal%20and%20won%20a%20state%E2%80%99s%20attorney%20race%20in%20Florida%2C%20and%20Mark%20Gonzalez%2C%20a%20defense%20attorney%20with%20%E2%80%9C%3Cem%20class%3D%5C%22small%5C%22%3ENOT%20GUILTY%3C%2Fem%3E%E2%80%9D%20tattooed%20on%20his%20chest%2C%20became%20the%20D.A.%20in%20Corpus%20Christi%2C%20Texas.%20Last%20month%2C%20Rachael%20Rollins%2C%20a%20former%20federal%20prosecutor%2C%20became%20the%20first%20African-American%20woman%20to%20win%20in%20a%20Democratic%20primary%20for%20D.A.%20in%20Suffolk%20County%2C%20Massachusetts%2C%20having%20promised%20to%20stop%20prosecuting%20drug%20possession%2C%20shoplifting%2C%20and%20driving%20with%20a%20suspended%20license%2C%20among%20other%20crimes.%20Instead%2C%20she%20said%2C%20she%20would%20handle%20the%20cases%20she%20didn%E2%80%99t%20dismiss%20in%20other%20ways%2C%20by%20sending%20defendants%20to%20community-service%20or%20education%20programs%2C%20for%20example.%20On%20September%207th%2C%20President%20Barack%20Obama%20delivered%20a%20speech%20to%20students%20at%20the%20University%20of%20Illinois%20at%20Urbana-Champaign%20in%20which%20he%20referred%20to%20Krasner%20and%20Rollins%3A%20%E2%80%9CIf%20you%20are%20really%20concerned%20about%20how%20the%20criminal-justice%20system%20treats%20African-Americans%2C%20the%20best%20way%20to%20protest%20is%20to%20vote%2C%E2%80%9D%20he%20said.%20%E2%80%9CDo%20what%20they%20just%20did%20in%20Philadelphia%20and%20Boston%20and%20elect%20state%20attorneys%20and%20district%20attorneys%20who%20are%20looking%20at%20issues%20in%20a%20new%20light.%E2%80%9D%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EKrasner%20now%20oversees%20five%20hundred%20and%20thirty-seven%20employees%2C%20including%20some%20three%20hundred%20prosecutors%2C%20and%20an%20annual%20budget%20of%20forty-two%20million%20dollars.%20With%20his%20tailored%20suits%2C%20well-trimmed%20silver%20hair%2C%20and%20square%20jaw%2C%20he%20could%20be%20mistaken%20for%20a%20Republican%20senator%2C%20but%20his%20speech%20is%20freewheeling%20and%20at%20times%20leaves%20his%20spokesperson%2C%20Ben%20Waxman%2C%20a%20thirty-three-year-old%20former%20journalist%2C%20looking%20anxious.%20At%20lunchtime%20each%20day%2C%20prosecutors%20returning%20from%20the%20courthouse%20stream%20through%20the%20doors%20of%20the%20D.A.%E2%80%99s%20office%2C%20pulling%20metal%20carts%20stacked%20with%20boxes%20of%20files%2C%20and%20ride%20an%20escalator%20to%20the%20mezzanine%2C%20then%20board%20an%20elevator%20to%20their%20offices.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EWhen%20Krasner%20first%20arrived%2C%20he%20found%2C%20at%20the%20top%20of%20the%20escalator%2C%20a%20wall%20of%20portraits%20of%20his%20predecessors%3A%20Arlen%20Specter%20(1966-74)%2C%20who%20was%20later%20elected%20to%20the%20U.S.%20Senate%3B%20Edward%C2%A0G.%20Rendell%20(1978-86)%2C%20who%20went%20on%20to%20become%20the%20mayor%20of%20Philadelphia%20and%20the%20governor%20of%20Pennsylvania%3B%20Lynne%20Abraham%20(1991-2010)%2C%20who%20ran%2C%20unsuccessfully%2C%20for%20mayor.%20It%20bothered%20Krasner%20that%20the%20wall%20did%20not%20feature%20portraits%20of%20the%20two%20former%20African-American%20D.A.s%2C%20Williams%20and%20the%20interim%20D.A.%2C%20Kelley%C2%A0B.%20Hodge.%20But%2C%20Krasner%20admitted%2C%20%E2%80%9Cit%E2%80%99s%20a%20little%20hard%20to%20love%20putting%20up%20a%20picture%20of%20a%20D.A.%20who%20is%20currently%20doing%20five%20years%20in%20jail.%E2%80%9D%20He%20took%20the%20portraits%20down.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EKrasner%20often%20talks%20about%20his%20ambition%20to%20make%20Philadelphia%20the%20best%20progressive%20D.A.%E2%80%99s%20office%20in%20the%20country%2C%20but%20he%20knows%20that%20he%20faces%20an%20almost%20insurmountable%20challenge.%20Resistance%20comes%20not%20only%20from%20the%20lawyers%20he%20now%20supervises%20but%20also%20from%20some%20judges%2C%20many%20of%20whom%20are%20former%20prosecutors.%20%E2%80%9CThey%20are%20being%20forced%20to%20look%20back%20on%20their%20entire%20careers%20and%20say%20to%20themselves%2C%20Did%20I%20get%20it%20all%20wrong%20as%20a%20prosecutor%3F%20Have

the past ten years, violent crime across the country has fallen, but, according to polls, many people continue to believe that it has increased. President Trump’s campaign exploited the fear of “American carnage,” and the criminal-justice system of the United States, which has the highest incarceration rate in the world, seems built on this misinformation. And yet, at a local level, there are signs of change. Krasner is one of about two dozen “progressive prosecutors,” many of them backed by Soros, who have won recent district-attorney races. In 2016, Aramis Ayala got early support from Shaquille O’Neal and won a state’s attorney race in Florida, and Mark Gonzalez, a defense attorney with “",["em",{"class":"small"},"NOT GUILTY"],"” tattooed on his chest, became the D.A. in Corpus Christi, Texas. Last month, Rachael Rollins, a former federal prosecutor, became the first African-American woman to win in a Democratic primary for D.A. in Suffolk County, Massachusetts, having promised to stop prosecuting drug possession, shoplifting, and driving with a suspended license, among other crimes. Instead, she said, she would handle the cases she didn’t dismiss in other ways, by sending defendants to community-service or education programs, for example. On September 7th, President Barack Obama delivered a speech to students at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in which he referred to Krasner and Rollins: “If you are really concerned about how the criminal-justice system treats African-Americans, the best way to protest is to vote,” he said. “Do what they just did in Philadelphia and Boston and elect state attorneys and district attorneys who are looking at issues in a new light.”"],["p","Krasner now oversees five hundred and thirty-seven employees, including some three hundred prosecutors, and an annual budget of forty-two million dollars. With his tailored suits, well-trimmed silver hair, and square jaw, he could be mistaken for a Republican senator, but his speech is freewheeling and at times leaves his spokesperson, Ben Waxman, a thirty-three-year-old former journalist, looking anxious. At lunchtime each day, prosecutors returning from the courthouse stream through the doors of the D.A.’s office, pulling metal carts stacked with boxes of files, and ride an escalator to the mezzanine, then board an elevator to their offices."],["p","When Krasner first arrived, he found, at the top of the escalator, a wall of portraits of his predecessors: Arlen Specter (1966-74), who was later elected to the U.S. Senate; Edward G. Rendell (1978-86), who went on to become the mayor of Philadelphia and the governor of Pennsylvania; Lynne Abraham (1991-2010), who ran, unsuccessfully, for mayor. It bothered Krasner that the wall did not feature portraits of the two former African-American D.A.s, Williams and the interim D.A., Kelley B. Hodge. But, Krasner admitted, “it’s a little hard to love putting up a picture of a D.A. who is currently doing five years in jail.” He took the portraits down."],["p","Krasner often talks about his ambition to make Philadelphia the best progressive D.A.’s office in the country, but he knows that he faces an almost insurmountable challenge. Resistance comes not only from the lawyers he now supervises but also from some judges, many of whom are former prosecutors. “They are being forced to look back on their entire careers and say to themselves, Did I get it all wrong as a prosecutor? Have I gotten it all wrong as a judge? All these years coming down with twenty-five years when it should’ve been ten? And ten when it could’ve been two?” He went on, “It takes a pretty remarkable human being, who turned down big law firms, turned down big money, to do public service, to say, ‘Damn, I screwed up, I’ve

After moving back home, while working as a carpenter he got called for jury duty and was assigned to a murder trial: an African-American handyman was accused of raping and strangling to death a seventy-six-year-old white woman in her home. One juror, an older man, “showed up with a cowboy hat,” Krasner recalled. “The first thing he said was something like, ‘We got to get this boy.’ ” After deliberation, Krasner and the other jurors voted to convict; the evidence of guilt was overwhelming.

He was accepted at Stanford Law, and, at a mixer on the third day, met his future wife, Rau. In his third year at Stanford, he applied for a job at the office he now leads. He summed up the interviewer’s stance as “Why aren’t you in love with the death penalty? What the hell is wrong with you?” Krasner said, “It was very clear to me, about five sentences in, that this was not an office where I could ever work.”"],["p","On the morning of September 13th, I watched Krasner greet thirty-eight young Assistant District Attorneys, known among the staff as “baby A.D.A.s,” at the start of an eight-week training period. A new class of prosecutors arrives every fall, and this year’s A.D.A.s could have been forgiven for thinking that they had mistakenly wandered into training for public defenders. “Who here has read Michelle Alexander?” Krasner asked, referring to the author of “The New Jim Crow,” an influential analysis of mass incarceration. “Well, even if you haven’t read it,” he said, “open the flyleaf. Look at the stats. There are more people of color in jail, in prison, on probation and parole than there were in slavery at the beginning of the Civil War.” He reminded the trainees that they represent “the commonwealth.” “That means you represent people who are not victims of crime, people who are not defendants. You represent kids who are going to public schools, and they have too many kids in the class,” he said. “You represent—because you are stewards of an enormous amount of social resources—what their lives can be in ten or fifteen years if resources are in those schools.”"],["p","To assist with his office’s training, Krasner had hired an organization called Prosecutor Impact, run by Adam Foss, a thirty-eight-year-old former prosecutor from Suffolk County, Massachusetts. In 2016, Foss, who has dreadlocks that fall below his waist, became a celebrity in social-justice circles after giving a ",["em",{"class":"small"},"TED"]," talk in which he detailed how prosecutors are “judged internally and externally by our convictions and our trial wins, so prosecutors aren’t really incentivized to be creative or to take risks on people we might not otherwise.” Foss, wearing jeans and a button-down shirt, stepped forward and told the A.D.A.s about his first day as a prosecutor, in 2008. “All I was told was how great I was, and how great prosecutors were, and how great everything that we did was,” he said. “Never once did I hear about the term ‘mass incarceration’ or trauma or poverty.”"],["p","For the A.D.A.s, Foss and his team had planned a visit to a prison, to talk to men who were given life sentences as teen-agers, and a sleepover at a homeless shelter. “We want people who are about to exercise their discretion and deal with the realities of homelessness and addiction and mental illness and danger, potentially, to have been in the vicinity of and to have spoken to some homeless people,” Krasner said. In his three decades as a defense attorney, he estimated that he had spent at least a year in prison, visiting clients. Six years ago, he and Rau bought a second-hand Lexus hard-top convertible, which Krasner drove with the roof down whenever he went to see imprisoned clients, as an antidote to the claustrophobia of prison."],["p","Ten years ago, Krasner was attacked outside his office by two men, one of whom slashed his face with a razor blade. He rarely speaks about the incident, but when he does it is usually to make a point about how victims of crime often desire something other than what the criminal-justice system provides. He summarized the traditional approach to caring for victims as “We’re not going to have a robust form of therapy for you.

weeks after the training, I visited Krasner at his eighteenth-floor office, which looks onto City Hall. On top of an empty bookshelf was a poster featuring two post-arrest photos, one of Martin Luther King, Jr., the other of Rosa Parks. “These are my kind of mug shots,” he said."],["p","After Krasner’s primary victory, he sought advice from a few progressive prosecutors, including Kim Ogg, who, in 2016, became the first Democratic D.A. in Harris County, Texas, in nearly four decades. She told Krasner that, shortly before she took office, she sent letters to thirty-eight prosecutors, informing them that she was planning to fire them. Within hours, she said, crime victims began contacting her to say that they’d been called by prosecutors, warning them that their cases would be compromised by the new D.A. She later discovered that relevant emails and documents had been deleted. At a press conference, she condemned the “lack of professionalism and the deliberate sabotage.” (The prosecutors denied any wrongdoing.)"],["p","Krasner, too, had a list of prosecutors who he believed would resist his efforts to change the office; he had fought many of them in court. “Some of them may be absolutely great, hardworking attorneys who just believe that too much incarceration is not enough, and they’re not capable of following orders, and they’re always going to be undermining you,” he said. “You’ve got to show them the door.” But he didn’t repeat Ogg’s mistake of letting them know in advance. On Krasner’s fourth day in office, a Friday, the office was closed, due to a snowstorm. Thirty-one employees received calls telling them to come in and reported to the office. One by one, they were asked to resign; if they didn’t, they were told, they would be fired on Monday. The list included the first Assistant District Attorney, a Deputy District Attorney, twelve supervisors, and seven prosecutors in the Homicide Unit. Security escorted them out of the building, and soon there were TV cameras outside, filming them carrying their belongings in cardboard boxes. A former homicide prosecutor named Richard Sax, who had resigned in 2017, after thirty-seven years in the office, told the Philadelphia ",["em","Inquirer"]," that the firings were “personal and vindictive.”"],["p","By February, Krasner had hired sixteen new lawyers, many of them former public defenders whom he knew. To help him run the office, he brought in Robert Listenbee, who had overseen juvenile-justice programs under Obama, and an eighty-three-year-old former judge named Carolyn Engel Temin, who had most recently been training judges in Bosnia. He also hired Movita Johnson-Harrell, an activist whose eighteen-year-old son was fatally shot seven years ago, to run the office’s newly renamed Victim Witness Services and Restorative Justice division. Krasner’s first initiative was to eliminate cash bail for most nonviolent crimes. “We don’t imprison the poor in the United States for the so-called crime of poverty,” he said. In March, he sent a memo to his staff outlining his policies, which he described as “an effort to end mass incarceration and bring balance back to sentencing.” Few of the ideas were truly new—many progressive prosecutors have stopped prosecuting people for possessing small amounts of marijuana, for instance, or have increased the number of people diverted from prison into drug-rehab programs—but the memo caught on in criminal-justice circles, arguably because of one recommendation: each time a prosecutor wanted to send somebody to prison, he had to calculate the cost of that imprisonment (an estimated forty-two thousand dollars per inmate per year), state it aloud in court, and explain the “unique benefits” of the punishment. James Forman, Jr., the author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning study of race and criminal justice “Locking Up Our Own,” teaches at Yale Law School. He assigned the memo as reading in his criminal-law class. Krasner’s suggestion was powerful, Forman told me: “Nobody seems to ask the questions of prison that we ever ask of any other aspect of the system.

Pennsylvania, unlike in New York and New Jersey, incarceration has increased in recent years. A 2018 report by Vincent Schiraldi, who used to oversee the Department of Probation in New York City and is now a research scientist at Columbia University, revealed that an extraordinary number of people in Pennsylvania are also under “mass supervision”—either by way of probation or parole. There are more parolees in the state than anywhere else in the country. One-third of the people in Pennsylvania’s prisons are there because they violated the rules of their probation or parole."],["p","In February, Mark Fazlollah, a reporter from the ",["em","Inquirer,"]," called Ben Waxman, Krasner’s spokesperson, about a police officer named Reggie Graham. A decade earlier, Graham had arrested the rapper Meek Mill on gun and drug charges. He spent several months in prison before his release, and received probation, which was periodically extended, by the same judge, until 2017. That fall, the judge found that Meek Mill had violated the terms of his probation by, among other things, getting arrested for popping wheelies on a dirt bike. He was sentenced to two to four years."],["p","The reporter wanted to know whether prosecutors were still calling on Graham to testify in court. Waxman asked around the office, and unearthed a “do not call” list, made by prosecutors during the previous regime, of sixty-six current and former police officers who had troubling histories, many of whom prosecutors had deemed insufficiently credible to call as witnesses in court. Graham was on the list. The list included the officers’ alleged transgressions:"],["blockquote",["p","aided and abetted his live-in girlfriend in a prostitution/escort business"],["p","deployed OC spray and kicked a handcuffed prisoner"],["p","arrested and charged with sexual abuse of children"],["p","drank alcohol then drove city car on-duty, misused city time, and accepted gifts from news reporters"],["p","physically assaulted his girlfriend"]],["p","The ",["em","Inquirer"]," broke the news about the list, and the Defender Association of Philadelphia subpoenaed Krasner to obtain it. A judge ordered Krasner to hand it over. The ",["em","Inquirer"]," obtained and published it, including the officers’ names. The story gave new momentum to Meek Mill’s efforts to get out of prison; in April, he was released on bail."],["p","“That list is a sliver of the information that we actually should provide,” Krasner told me. He had recognized many of the names from his time as a defense attorney. “But there were a lot of missing ones, too,” he said. He was trying to obtain records from the police department’s internal-affairs division, in order to compile a more thorough document. “We’re in the middle of a tug-of-war. If they don’t collaborate, we’ll sue them because we have to comply with our constitutional obligations—and we take that very seriously.” The Defender Association filed petitions to reopen six thousand four hundred cases in which an officer on the list had been involved."],["p","The Conviction Review Unit of the D.A.’s office was set up in 2014 to investigate claims of innocence. It had been run by a veteran prosecutor, who was among those asked to resign in January. Skeptical that anyone could impartially investigate his longtime colleagues, Krasner hired an outsider, Patricia Cummings, who had overseen the Conviction Integrity Unit in Dallas County, which was the first unit of its kind and gained national attention for its aggressive approach to investigating wrongful convictions. Andrew Wellbrock, whom Krasner kept on as the unit’s second-in-command, explained that, under the previous D.A., “if we came to a case where we wanted to exonerate somebody, it had to go through a ridiculous chain of command that, depending on who was in charge on any given day last year, could have a different result.” Krasner has expanded the unit to include five attorneys, two paralegals, and an administrator, and the news about his willingness to investigate past convictions has spread. “There’s a lot of people in jail with time on their hands who don’t actually deserve to have their convictions overturned, but they’re all going to write you letters,” Krasner said. “So by being evenhanded and being fair, you make a lot more work for yourself. But, obviously, we need to be evenhanded and fair.”"],["p","The Law Division handles appeals filed by prisoners. Its head is Nancy Winkelman, a former partner at Schnader Harrison Segal &amp; Lewis, one of the biggest law firms in Philadelphia. In 2016, a friend suggested that she watch Foss’s ",["em",{"class":"small"},"TED"]," talk, after which, she said, “All of a sudden everything I started seeing and reading was about progressive prosecution. You know how that happens? All of a sudden it was everywhere. And then it was here in Philadelphia.” Krasner hired her in January. Since then, much of her time is spent dealing with the appeals of men on Pennsylvania’s death row, many of whom, she and Krasner have found, received especially poor legal representation. According to the Death Penalty Information Center, of the approximately two hundred death sentences handed down in Philadelphia since 1974, nearly a hundred and fifty have been overturned, often because of inadequate representation or prosecutors’ misconduct."],["p","To overhaul the Homicide Unit, Krasner hired Anthony Voci, who had served as a homicide prosecutor in the D.A.’s office, sometimes facing Krasner in court, before going to work as a defense attorney for twelve years. Last spring, Krasner and Voci reviewed the case of Dontia Patterson, who had been in prison since 2007, when he was seventeen, convicted of killing his friend. Krasner and Voci filed a motion in court that pointedly blamed their predecessors in the D.A.’s office for imprisoning Patterson for “a crime he did not commit, in all likelihood.” Although two witnesses had identified somebody else as the assailant, prosecutors had failed to share this information with the defense attorney. Patterson was freed from prison, after eleven years."]],["inline-embed",{"type":"section","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22section%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cp%3EOn%20March%208th%2C%20former%20prosecutors%20held%20an%20event%20at%20the%20Fraternal%20Order%20of%20Police%20lodge%20to%20honor%20the%20thirty-one%20prosecutors%20whom%20Krasner%20had%20fired.%20%E2%80%9CPlease%20join%20us%20as%20we%20celebrate%20our%20former%20colleagues%20who%20worked%20tirelessly%20on%20behalf%20of%20crime%20victims%20and%20the%20citizens%20of%20the%20City%20of%20Philadelphia%2C%E2%80%9D%20the%20invitation%20read.%20The%20attendees%20included%20former%20colleagues%20and%20police%20officers.%20The%20fired%20prosecutors%20lined%20up%20to%20receive%20commemorative%20plaques%2C%20and%20were%20honored%20for%20their%20%E2%80%9Cseven%20hundred%20seventy%20years%E2%80%99%20worth%20of%20combined%20service.%E2%80%9D%20Eight%20had%20worked%20in%20the%20D.A.%E2%80%99s%20office%20for%20at%20least%20three%20decades.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EEdward%20McCann%2C%20who%20had%20retired%20in%202015%20after%20twenty-six%20years%2C%20addressed%20the%20crowd.%20%E2%80%9CThose%20of%20you%20who%20tried%20homicide%20cases%E2%80%94I%20saw%20the%20hours%20you%20put%20in%2C%E2%80%9D%20he%20said.%20%E2%80%9CWhen%20something%20like%20this%20happens%2C%20there%20is%20a%20natural%20reaction.%C2%A0.%C2%A0.%C2%A0.%20You%20say%2C%20%E2%80%98I%20gave%20everything%20to%20this%20job%2C%20to%20this%20work%E2%80%94sometimes%20too%20much%E2%80%94and%20this%20is%20my%20payoff%3F%E2%80%99%C2%A0%E2%80%9D%20He%20went%20on%2C%20%E2%80%9CIf%20you%E2%80%99re%20feeling%20that%2C%20it%E2%80%99s%20completely%20natural%2C%20and%20I%E2%80%99m%20sure%20you%20aren%E2%80%99t%20alone.%C2%A0.%C2%A0.%C2%A0.%20The%20anger%20won%E2%80%99t%20pass%20and%20it%20shouldn%E2%80%99t.%20But%20questioning%20whether%20your%20commitment%20and%20talent%20and%20heart%20were%20wasted%20on%20this%20job%E2%80%94that%20will%20pass.%E2%80%9D%20They%20had%20all%20%E2%80%9Ctouched%20lives%2C%E2%80%9D%20he%20said.%20%E2%80%9CWhether%20you%20had%20the%20mother%20of%20a%20homicide%20victim%20crying%20on%20your%20shoulder%20and%20thanking%20you%20for%20getting%20justice%20for%20her%20son%2C%20or%20whether%20a%20victim%20of%20a%20car%20theft%20or%20a%20burglary%20said%20to%20themselves%20one%20random%20day%20after%20you%20handled%20their%20case%2C%20%E2%80%98That%20A.D.A.%20really%20cared%20about%20what%20happened%20to%20me.%E2%80%99%C2%A0%E2%80%9D%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EThe%20former%20A.D.A.s%2C%20aligned%20with%20the%20police%20and%20the%20victims%2C%20appeared%20to%20be%20at%20war%20with%20the%20newcomers%2C%20many%20of%20them%20former%20public%20defenders.%20A%20new%20employee%20told%20me%20that%20sometimes%20he%20stepped%20onto%20an%20elevator%20with%20longtime%20employees%2C%20and%20suddenly%20everyone%20would%20stop%20talking.%20Soon%20after%20Krasner%20took%20the%20job%2C%20someone%20who%20purported%20to%20be%20an%20employee%20began%20posting%20on%20Twitter%20as%20%E2%80%9CWen%20Baxman%E2%80%9D%E2%80%94a%20play%20on%20the%20name%20of%20Krasner%E2%80%99s%20spokesperson%E2%80%94identifying%20himself%20as%20the%20office%E2%80%99s%20%E2%80%9CDirector%20of%20Unofficial%20Communications.%E2%80%9D%20Krasner%20later%20described%20the%20tweets%20as%20%E2%80%9Cjust%20a%20lot%20of%20carping%20about%20%E2%80%98We%20shouldn%E2%80%99t%20have%20fired%20these%20people%2C%E2%80%99%20or%20%E2%80%98We%20shouldn%E2%80%99t%20have%20this%20policy%2C%E2%80%99%20or%20%E2%80%98The%20city%20is%20burning%2C%E2%80%99%20or%20whatever%20nonsense.%E2%80%9D%20He%20didn%E2%80%99t%20bother%20launching%20an%20investigation.%20%E2%80%9CYou%20go%20to%20war%20when%20you%E2%80%99ve%20got%20to%2C%E2%80%9D%20he%20said.%20%E2%80%9CLet%20them%20get%20their%20ya-yas%20out.%E2%80%9D%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EIn%20late%20June%2C%20the%20media%20learned%20that%20Krasner%20had%20offered%20a%20plea%20deal%20to%20the%20two%20brothers%20who%20had%20killed%20Sergeant%20Robert%20Wilson%20III%20while%20trying%20to%20rob%20a%20video-game%20shop%20in%202015.%20In%20exchange%20for%20pleading%20guilty%2C%20they%20would%20be%20sentenced%20to%20life%20in%20prison%20without%20parole%2C%20plus%20an%20additional%20fifty%20to%20a%20hundred%20years%2C%20rather%20than%20given%20the%20death%20penalty.%20The%20death%20penalty%20in%20Pennsylvania%20is%20now%20a%20relic%E2%80%94no%20one%20has%20been%20executed%20since%201999%2C%20and%20the%20governor%20instituted%20a%20moratorium%20on%20executions%20in%202015.%20But%20Wilson%E2%80%99s%20sister%20said%20that%20she%20was%20%E2%80%9Cdisgusted%E2%80%9D%20by%20the%20plea%20deal.%20Police%20officers%20packed%20the%20courtroom%20to%20honor%20the%20memory%20of%20their%20fellow-officer%2C%20and%20railed%20against%20Krasner%20on%20the%20police%20union%E2%80%99s%20Facebook%20page.%20One%20called%20him%20a%20%E2%80%9Cpathetic%20cop%20hating%20DA.%E2%80%9D%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22callout%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522callout%2522%252C%2522name%2522%253A%2522inset-l

March 8th, former prosecutors held an event at the Fraternal Order of Police lodge to honor the thirty-one prosecutors whom Krasner had fired. “Please join us as we celebrate our former colleagues who worked tirelessly on behalf of crime victims and the citizens of the City of Philadelphia,” the invitation read. The attendees included former colleagues and police officers. The fired prosecutors lined up to receive commemorative plaques, and were honored for their “seven hundred seventy years’ worth of combined service.” Eight had worked in the D.A.’s office for at least three decades."],["p","Edward McCann, who had retired in 2015 after twenty-six years, addressed the crowd. “Those of you who tried homicide cases—I saw the hours you put in,” he said. “When something like this happens, there is a natural reaction. . . . You say, ‘I gave everything to this job, to this work—sometimes too much—and this is my payoff?’ ” He went on, “If you’re feeling that, it’s completely natural, and I’m sure you aren’t alone. . . . The anger won’t pass and it shouldn’t. But questioning whether your commitment and talent and heart were wasted on this job—that will pass.” They had all “touched lives,” he said. “Whether you had the mother of a homicide victim crying on your shoulder and thanking you for getting justice for her son, or whether a victim of a car theft or a burglary said to themselves one random day after you handled their case, ‘That A.D.A. really cared about what happened to me.’ ”"],["p","The former A.D.A.s, aligned with the police and the victims, appeared to be at war with the newcomers, many of them former public defenders. A new employee told me that sometimes he stepped onto an elevator with longtime employees, and suddenly everyone would stop talking. Soon after Krasner took the job, someone who purported to be an employee began posting on Twitter as “Wen Baxman”—a play on the name of Krasner’s spokesperson—identifying himself as the office’s “Director of Unofficial Communications.” Krasner later described the tweets as “just a lot of carping about ‘We shouldn’t have fired these people,’ or ‘We shouldn’t have this policy,’ or ‘The city is burning,’ or whatever nonsense.” He didn’t bother launching an investigation. “You go to war when you’ve got to,” he said. “Let them get their ya-yas out.”"],["p","In late June, the media learned that Krasner had offered a plea deal to the two brothers who had killed Sergeant Robert Wilson III while trying to rob a video-game shop in 2015. In exchange for pleading guilty, they would be sentenced to life in prison without parole, plus an additional fifty to a hundred years, rather than given the death penalty. The death penalty in Pennsylvania is now a relic—no one has been executed since 1999, and the governor instituted a moratorium on executions in 2015. But Wilson’s sister said that she was “disgusted” by the plea deal. Police officers packed the courtroom to honor the memory of their fellow-officer, and railed against Krasner on the police union’s Facebook page. One called him a “pathetic cop hating DA.”"],["inline-embed",{"type":"callout","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22callout%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22inset-left%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22cartoon%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522cartoon%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%2522%252Fcartoon%252F5bca74ee67790b40d0247ad4%2522%252C%2522width%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522height%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522caption%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%225bca74ee67790b40d0247ad4%5C%22%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%22%2C%22attrs%22%3A%7B%7D%7D","ref":""},["inline-embed",{"type":"cartoon","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22cartoon%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22%2Fcartoon%2F5bca74ee67790b40d0247ad4%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":"5bca74ee67790b40d0247ad4"}]],["p","In September, Krasner’s office enraged the union again, when it filed first-degree-murder charges against a former police officer named Ryan Pownall, who had shot a thirty-year-old man in the summer of 2017. The victim, David Jones, had been riding a dirt bike when Pownall stopped him, patted him down, and felt a gun. Jones bolted and dropped his weapon, but the officer fired at him anyway, striking him twice in the back and killing him. These were the first such charges in nearly twenty years brought against a Philadelphia cop for an on-duty shooting. The president of the city’s police union called Krasner’s decision an “absurd disgrace.” But it was the second time that Pownall, who is white, had shot an African-American man in the back while in uniform. The first shooting, seven years earlier, left the victim paralyzed."],["p","Krasner is unfazed by the union’s ire. In his view, the union does not represent the will or the views of many of the sixty-three hundred officers on Philadelphia’s police force, who, he said, “want accountability, they want integrity.” Krasner has called the union “frankly racist and white-dominated,” and reminds people that it endorsed Trump for President “in a city where he got fifteen per cent of the vote.” The Guardian Civic League, which represents two thousand African-American officers in Philadelphia, by contrast, endorsed Krasner’s candidacy after he won the primary."],["p","The union is so powerful, Krasner said, that, frequently, when the police commissioner fires someone, that officer is returned to the force. “He has almost no capacity to discipline, to terminate, or even to move to another unit, because everything is overturned in this corrupt arbitration process.” In this context, Krasner suggested, the D.A. has a responsibility to stand firm against police misconduct.

the past, the Philadelphia D.A.’s office has drawn its prosecutors primarily from local law schools, many of them from Temple University’s Beasley School of Law. Partly as a result, the office felt insular, Krasner said. He is looking for “every kind of diversity,” and is particularly interested in “people who are willing to stand up to judges.” This fall, he and his staff are visiting twenty-nine law schools, including Harvard, Yale, Howard, the University of Texas at Austin, Stanford, and N.Y.U., to recruit new prosecutors. One September afternoon, at N.Y.U. Law School, several dozen students had crowded into a classroom, reaching for sandwiches on a table, before Krasner, with two of his senior lawyers, Nancy Winkelman and Robert Listenbee, gave a presentation. “We are looking for raw talent, hard work, and a big old moral compass,” he said. He explained that, in Philadelphia, “the people are actually pretty damn progressive, and the court system is stuck in 1954. While that is terrible, in a way, it’s kind of wonderful if you’re a young, civil-rights-type lawyer.”"],["p","Krasner recounted his own experiences as a young public defender begging for mercy from prosecutors, many of whom were, in his view, “disinterested in the possibility of actual innocence.” Wouldn’t the criminal-justice system be more just, he asked, if the people who traditionally had become public defenders decided to become prosecutors instead? If the students wanted to go into criminal law, they could be prosecutors or public defenders—or, he said, they could be progressive prosecutors. “Some people call them public defenders with power,” he joked."],["p","An hour later, Krasner arrived at the Fordham University School of Law, on West Sixty-second Street in Manhattan. Outside the building, he changed his shirt and put on a new tie—his routine when he has three or four speaking events in a day. In a lecture hall, before some thirty students, he launched into another law-school stump speech. After he finished, several hands rose. He called on a young woman in the front row, who looked ready for court in a gray dress and black jacket. “I have two questions,” she said."],["p","“You only get one,” Krasner said."],["p","“Well, I’ll make it a really run-on one,” she said, cheerily. She asked how Krasner balanced the perspective of victims in his work. After he spoke, he turned back to her. “I know I was unkind when I said I wouldn’t answer another question, but do you have another question?”"],["p","“I do,” she said, and asked about his plan to address recidivism rates, especially for young people coming out of prison."],["p","After finishing his presentation, Krasner lingered in the hall outside, fielding more questions. The young woman approached, a student named Dana Kai-el McBeth. “I was at E.J.I. this summer,” she said."],["p","“You were at E.J.I.?” Krasner said. “That’s awesome.” There is stiff competition to get a summer position at the Equal Justice Initiative, the progressive legal organization run by Bryan Stevenson, in Alabama."],["p","“I don’t have my résumé, but here is my business card,” she said. Twenty minutes later, Krasner, Listenbee, and Winkelman interviewed the student in an empty conference room. Halfway through, Winkelman sent Krasner a text asking if he wanted to offer her a job on the spot. Krasner flipped over the business card the student had given him and scribbled a note to his first assistant: “Nancy thinks immediate offer. You agree/disagree?” Listenbee agreed. Krasner has rarely made a job offer to a candidate during an interview, but, he said, “She just seemed like a lot of talent, a lot of spunk. Either a perfect employee or a rebel. We’ll see.” ♦"]]],"canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"sections":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"},"slug":"magazine","children":[{"id":"591baeb5e859f74338458b7f","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"591baeb5e859f74338458b7f","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Annals of Justice","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"annals-of-justice"},{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"},{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"}],"name":"Annals of Justice","parent":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"},"slug":"annals-of-justice"}]}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"magazine","contentTags":[],"contentType":"article","contributors":[{"name":"Jennifer Gonnerman","type":"author","title":"Jennifer Gonnerman joined The New Yorker as a staff writer in 2015.

ostensible subject of “The Lifespan of a Fact” (directed by Leigh Silverman, at Studio 54) is the truth—what constitutes it and who gets to decide. Actually, the play is about the prerogatives demanded by an unyielding ego, here of the defensive-male variety. The script, which is credited to a trio of playwrights—Jeremy Kareken, David Murrell, and Gordon Farrell—is based on ",["a",{"href":"https://www.amazon.com/Lifespan-Fact-John-DAgata/dp/0393340732"},"a curious book of the same name"],", from 2012, which grew out of an antagonistic e-mail correspondence between the writer John D’Agata and Jim Fingal, an intern at the magazine ",["em","The Believer"],", who had been assigned to fact-check a piece D’Agata had written about Levi Presley, a teen-ager who committed suicide by leaping from the top of a Las Vegas hotel. What began as a string of simple factual queries from Fingal swiftly escalated into an epic tussle over questions of authorial invention and the nature of narrative nonfiction. D’Agata, who had apparently never encountered a fact that he was unwilling to fudge in the name of art, refused to give an inch; Fingal pressed on, growing more persnickety with each dispute. The tug-of-war lasted for half a decade."],["p","For the purposes of the stage, it has been compressed into a frantic five days. When the action begins, it is Wednesday, and Jim Fingal (a charmingly insistent Daniel Radcliffe) is hovering in the office of Emily Penrose (the ever-sensitive Cherry Jones), the editor-in-chief of the magazine where he is interning. His usual duties amount to glorified coffee-fetching, but Emily has decided to crash John D’Agata’s Vegas piece into the upcoming issue, which must go to the printer first thing on Monday. The article needs a speedy fact-check, and Jim, who is quick to mention his Harvard pedigree, convinces her that he’s the man for the job. Earnestly scribbling in a Moleskine notebook, Jim radiates nervous energy and ambition; Emily notices the way he hungrily eyes her desk when she asks him where he sees himself in five years. But by Thursday morning he’s back in her office to report that he has gotten snagged on a tangle of errors:"],["blockquote",["p","Okay, he says that on the day Levi died, “lap dancing was temporarily banned by the city,” but that doesn’t check out. The day ",["em","before"]," Levi died, the Las Vegas ",["em","Sun"]," wrote about a possible upcoming ban on touching strippers in fully nude establishments, but there’s nothing about a possible ban on lap dancing altogether in topless or even so-called go-go bars, where nipple nudity is essentially banned, but of course establishments get around that using pasties—"]],["p","And that’s just the second clause of D’Agata’s first sentence."],["p","Some writers might appreciate this scrupulous attention to detail. John (Bobby Cannavale) is not one of them. First, in an outraged fusillade of e-mails, which are cleverly projected onto a screen at the side of the stage, and then in person—growling bearishly into his phone as he sits in an overstuffed armchair, swaddled in an incongruous pink bathrobe—he tells Jim, in no uncertain terms, to piss off. He has written not an “article,” as Jim so thoughtlessly calls it, but an “essay,” a semantic distinction that lies at the core of John’s very sense of self. He is not a journalist, a small-minded fact-grubber; he is a literary essayist, a self-appointed heir to ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2008/04/28/arms-and-the-man-3"},"Herodotus"],", Cicero, Seneca, and Plutarch, who, in his view, “nudged details to create a closer understanding.” Isn’t he entitled to do some nudging of his own if it allows him to better convey the symbolic meaning of Levi Presley’s tragic death?"],["p","Thus are the battle lines drawn: soulful artist vs. nitpicking pedant, in John’s view; amoral fabricator vs. ethical realist, in Jim’s. The battle itself plays out mostly in John’s home in Vegas, where the playwrights contrive to send Jim so that the two foes can confront each other in the flesh; Emily eventually follows, to act as referee, or babysitter. (One wonders about the team effort it took to write this play about collaborative dysfunction.) John, who moved to Vegas to care for his ailing mother, is still living in her house after her death; he stalks around her dowdy, fifties-style living room, with its stiffly upholstered sofa and yellow floral wallpaper, like a wild animal stuck in the wrong habitat. Few actors do wounded masculinity better than Cannavale. His John, by turns petty, aggressive, and self-pitying, looms a head above Radcliffe’s Jim, pouring whiskey and slinging insults, plus the occasional fist, as the younger man stands his ground, piously pelting him with inaccuracy after inaccuracy."],["p","For such a conceit to work, we have to believe in the merit of the thing that is in dispute. Is one essay really worth all this fuss? Time and again, we are reminded of the profundity of D’Agata’s writing. “David Foster Wallace called him one of America’s most significant living writers,” Jim, who has done his due diligence on Google, informs us; if there is such a thing as damning with strong praise, this kind of starry-eyed overreach might be it. As with the book version of “The Lifespan of a Fact,” the trouble here is that John’s literary style, and therefore his authority, depends on an accrual of exactly the kinds of niggling details that he is so eager to dismiss. His essay on Levi Presley is loaded with precise figures and dates; they’re just not the right ones. Take his explanation for why, in that fraught first sentence, he chose to inflate the number of strip clubs in Vegas from thirty-one to thirty-four: “I picked thirty-four because I liked the rhythm.” This is funny, even a little poignant. Writers are shown up as the pathetically vain, illogical creatures we are, and the scene ends with a big laugh from the audience. Less amusing, as Emily points out, is John’s assertion that a girl who jumped to her death on the same day as Levi killed herself by hanging. John wants his subject to feel unique. If the price is callous disregard for another person, well, that’s just aesthetic necessity."],["p","As the play goes on, and its initially sharp comedy dulls into a repetitive deadlock, it becomes clear that John is a martyr not to his notion of poetic truth but to the demands of his paper-thin writerly pride. He can’t tolerate any of Jim’s interferences, no matter how valid or minute, because to do so would throw his whole identity into doubt. Why does he feel so victimized by scrutiny? Might it have something to do with his own depressive, possibly suicidal tendencies, which are hastily suggested as a kind of emotional shortcut by which to understand his intransigence; or with his relationship with his mother, whose presence is still so oppressively felt in her old home? We don’t find out. Instead, we get Emily as a representative of female authority, alternately cajoling and threatening the two men in an effort to reach some form of compromise as the hour grows ever later. Emily may be hardened in the way of tough women who’ve had to claw their way to the top—in the early scenes in her office, she wears black patent-leather brogues polished to a vicious sheen and displays a withering phone manner—but in Vegas she finds herself constrained by a more archetypal role. “Fuck off. I am not your mother,” she says to Jim—not that he, or John, is willing to stop behaving as if she were. Jones, a consummately generous performer, softens Emily’s rougher edges, but I wish that Silverman had found a way for her to serve as more than a mere foil to these bickering men."],["p","This is a strange time to be debating the merits of truth in journalism on the stage—and it ",["em","is"]," journalism that John is practicing here, regardless of his genre hairsplitting. What distinguishes him from a ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2003/05/26/laffaire-blair"},"Jayson Blair"],", or a Stephen Glass, or, for that matter, a ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/09/10/how-rudy-giuliani-turned-into-trumps-clown"},"Rudy Giuliani"],", whose “Truth isn’t truth” slogan may come closest to capturing John’s point of view? The climactic scene of the play, in which John, with the obsessive precision of a lawyer making a summation, raises doubts about the dimensions of a piece of furniture in order to prove that there’s no such thing as objective reality, feels like an unintentional parody of our postmodern times. Applied to essay writing or to journalism, his logic is barely coherent, but that’s not to say that it doesn’t have a place. He should give politics a try. ♦"]]],"canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"sections":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"},"slug":"magazine","children":[{"id":"5910aa3ddd6207318b5db99c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5910aa3ddd6207318b5db99c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"The

Storm Won’t Come,” the first track from Richard Thompson’s new album, “13 Rivers,” also happened to be the weather forecast for New York Harbor. Another East Coast storm would stay well south that day, making for a misty morning in the city and a low, gray sky that cast a flat light over the water. In short, it was a good day to ride the Staten Island Ferry."],["p","Larking about in the city has not been an option for Thompson until recently. He lived in Los Angeles for three decades, before moving to Montclair, New Jersey, earlier this year. At sixty-nine, he has the aquiline features and facial hair of an aging knight of King Arthur’s court. Thompson underscored his West-to-East transition by driving cross-country in five days this past January. He passed through many of the places he has long known only from songs. As a songwriter, he said, while waiting for the next ferry in the terminal, “it’s frustrating, if you’re British, to look over and see how much subject matter is built into America.” He added, “ ‘Drove my Chevy to the levy’—you’ve already written half a song!”"],["p","In composing his best-known tune, “1952, Vincent Black Lightning”—a kind of biker Child Ballad—he said, “I was thinking, What place and brand names have the same mythology to the British?” His neighbor had a Vincent, a now defunct British bikemaker."],["p","Thompson had not ridden the ferry since 1970, when he was still in Fairport Convention, a seminal band in British folk rock. Les Paul, among others, taught him how to combine the drone of Scottish pipes with the complex harmonic moves on his father’s jazz records. “Did you know that, according to ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/duke-ellington"},"Duke Ellington"],", jazz and Scottish music are the only two kinds of music with natural swing?” he asked."],["p","The harbor was full of droning sounds that would feel right on Thompson’s new record—mournful foghorns emerging from the mist that hid the banks and the stanchions of the Brooklyn Bridge. On Staten Island, Thompson found a diner up the hill and got some breakfast."],["p","“13 Rivers” was recorded in L.A., before Thompson left the city, but it sounds as if he’s ready for a change. The opening lines of “The Storm Won’t Come” are:"],["blockquote",["p","I’m longing for a storm to blow through town"],["p","And blow these sad old buildings down"],["p","Fire to burn what fire may"],["p","And rain to wash it all away"]],["p","The lyrics have the menace and the mystery of the Scottish Border poets who were on the shelf in Thompson’s family home. After the third verse, which declares, “There is no storm, so I’ll make my own,” there’s a guitar solo, in which Thompson’s right hand follows the Celtic patterns of traditional music, while the left hand does harmonic escape tricks. “When I was growing up, my father had these great records from Earl Hines”—the jazz pianist—“who was the master of skating on the edge,” Thompson said. “He would create inescapable musical knots for himself. ‘How the hell is he getting out of this one?’ But he’d always escape.”"],["p","Thompson gets a deep twang from his Stratocaster by grabbing hold of the strings with two fingers while keeping the pick between his thumb and the base of his index finger. “It covers a lot of emotion, a deep twang,” he said. Audiovisually, it can take you out to the moors of Scottish songs or up to the high lonesome of country-and-Western, as heard on Thompson’s improvised soundtrack for ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2006/04/24/the-ecstatic-truth"},"Werner Herzog’s"]," “Grizzly Man.” A military-history buff, Thompson scored “The Cold Blue,” a new HBO film made from restored footage shot by William Wyler for a 1943 documentary about the men of the Eighth Air Force."],["p","But why Montclair? The move was prompted by a sequence of events that Thompson calls “family troubles,” involving the end of his marriage and the start of a new relationship on this coast. Fans know something of earlier Thompson family troubles involving Linda, his wife and partner onstage in the seventies. They continued as an act while their marriage fell apart, getting some of their best songs out of the breakup, which can be heard on their 1982 album “Shoot Out the Lights.”"],["p","After breakfast, Thompson caught the ferry back. In terms of monuments per minute, the Staten Island Ferry may be the best twenty-five-minute boat ride in the world, but Thompson was lukewarm on the sights. He perked up, though, when a fellow-passenger mentioned that Spalding Gray is believed to have killed himself by jumping from the boat. “Not to add a darker note,” the passenger said."],["p","“As if one were needed!” Thompson declared, looking happy for the first time. ♦"]]],"canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"sections":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"},"slug":"magazine","children":[{"id":"59113a3e6c4c222f03a87c6a","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"59113a3e6c4c222f03a87c6a","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"The Musical Life","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"the-musical-life"},{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"},{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"}],"name":"The Musical Life","parent":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"},"slug":"the-musical-life"}]}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"magazine","contentTags":[{"name":"Richard Thompson","url":"/tag/richard-thompson"},{"name":"\"13 Rivers\"","url":"/tag/13-rivers"},{"name":"Pop Music","url":"/tag/pop-music"},{"name":"Musicians","url":"/tag/musicians"},{"name":"Folk Music","url":"/tag/folk-music"}],"contentType":"article","contributors":[{"name":"John Seabrook","type":"author","title":"John Seabrook has been a contributor to \u003cem&gt;The New Yorker\u003c/em&gt; since 1989 and became a staff writer in 1993.","email":"","bio":["div",["p","John Seabrook has been a contributor to ",["em","The New Yorker"]," since 1989 and became a staff writer in 1993.

the two weeks leading up to Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation to the Supreme Court, nearly everyone seemed to have a strong opinion about Christine Blasey Ford, who, on September 27th, testifying nervously but sincerely before the Senate Judiciary Committee, said that Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted her when they were both high-school students, and about Kavanaugh, who furiously insisted that he had never done such a thing, to her or to any woman. Was there any remotely politically attuned American for whom that astonishing day, followed by the six-day F.B.I. investigation and the down-to-the-wire Senate vote, was not at the top of her mind? Yes. That person—to judge from her public pronouncements—was Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri, who is running for a third term this fall in a state that Donald Trump carried in 2016 by nineteen points."],["p","On September 19th, three days before Ford agreed to testify, McCaskill announced that she would vote against Kavanaugh, but she explained that her decision was not related to Ford’s accusations. Instead, she cited a mostly overlooked line from an e-mail that Kavanaugh had written to a colleague in 2002, when he was a White House staff member, indicating that he thought the limits on campaign contributions to candidates had “some constitutional problems.” McCaskill said that this kind of thinking on the Court would further corrupt the political process, and encourage large donations of “dark money” from wealthy people and foreign governments."],["p","With the confirmation vote approaching—as Senators Heidi Heitkamp, of North Dakota, and Joe Manchin, of West Virginia, two other red-state Democrats who are up for reëlection, publicly agonized over their votes on Kavanaugh, and a third, Joe Donnelly, of Indiana, announced that he was voting no because of Ford’s testimony—McCaskill said nothing at all about the Court. She talked instead about her determination to protect Obamacare’s provisions guaranteeing coverage for people with preëxisting conditions. On the day of Ford’s testimony, McCaskill tweeted about a bipartisan bill, which she had co-sponsored, intended to combat the opioid epidemic. “This happens when we talk, listen, and compromise. And it will save lives,” she wrote. The next day, her travelling press secretary, Eric Mee, tweeted a picture of McCaskill holding an adorable puppy, under the legend “What we all really need today.”"],["p","Through it all, McCaskill’s Republican opponent, Josh Hawley, who is thirty-eight years old, talked about Kavanaugh non-stop. Hawley, Missouri’s attorney general, has gleefully portrayed McCaskill as part of a radical smear campaign created by obstructionist liberals, tweeting, “ignoring her state &amp; voting against Judge Kavanaugh is bad enough. But she also watched her party turn this confirmation process into a circus, and said nothing. That’s shameful. @clairecmc won’t stand up to the leftwing because she’s ONE OF THEM.”"],["p","Hawley’s campaign is mainly about McCaskill—lately, he has been touring Missouri in a bus decorated with unflattering pictures of her and the Democratic leaders in Congress, Charles Schumer and Nancy Pelosi. He insists that she is on the far left; she insists, much more plausibly, that she is one of the remaining centrists in Congress. As she said to me, “I am truly a moderate. To my core, I am a moderate.” Republicans have had McCaskill’s seat in their sights for years, and the fight over Kavanaugh has given a big boost to most of the candidates who are trying to unseat Democratic senators in red states. Polls show the Missouri race to be a tossup, with Hawley gaining slightly in recent weeks. Outside money is pouring into the state—$54.9 million, according to the latest reports, from independent groups, evenly split between the two campaigns, plus nearly forty million that the candidates have raised themselves. The race, possibly the Senate’s closest this year, is a test of whether a Democrat who doesn’t openly break ranks with the national party—even an adept veteran like McCaskill—can survive in Trump

than thirty years ago, when McCaskill was a young state legislator, she had a recurring nightmare, from which she would wake up in a cold sweat. In the nightmare, which she describes in her 2015 memoir, “Plenty Ladylike,” she’s standing on the floor of the state legislature, waiting to be sworn in for a new term. Somebody taps her on the shoulder and says, “Claire, what are you doing here? Don’t you remember? You lost.” McCaskill has run for political office twenty-three times, and lost only once, but the fear has never really gone away. A Democrat in a place that seems to become more Republican with each election cycle, she has had to hone her instinct for locating the ever-smaller zone where there is some remaining overlap between her party and her state."],["p","McCaskill grew up in a politically obsessed family, and decided at a very early age that she wanted to be a politician. Her father was an elected county Democratic Party chairman and, later, the state insurance commissioner; her mother was a member of the city council in Columbia. When she was nine, they took her to the annual Jackson Days dinner, in Springfield, Missouri, a long-standing Democratic fund-raising event that has featured speakers such as William Jennings Bryan, Huey Long, Harry Truman, and John F. Kennedy. This spring, McCaskill delivered the closing address."],["p","The event, now called the Democrat Days dinner, took place on April 7th, at the Oasis, a hotel designed to call to mind Las Vegas in the Rat Pack days. McCaskill, who is sixty-five, has a helmet of short blond hair and a broad, open face. If you didn’t know she was a politician, you might take her for the president of a college or a hospital in a small Midwestern city. She arrived early, greeted people in the foyer, and wandered over to the tables set up for a live auction, where she bid five hundred dollars on a large basket of meat and cheese. In the ballroom, she listened with apparently rapt attention to remarks by a long procession of state officials."],["p","Springfield is the largest city in southern Missouri, which is overwhelmingly white, mainly rural, economically stressed, and dominated culturally by farms, factories, and military bases. McCaskill knows her voters, and practices an everyday, provincial politics that bears no resemblance to the big-picture, left-wing variety associated with Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. In her focus on improving government services that help ordinary people, McCaskill represents an alternative future of the Democratic Party, one that deserves closer attention than it usually gets. She writes in her book that people in Missouri “wanted to know if I could help them get their veterans’ benefits, keep their post office open, get drought relief to help feed their cattle.” In her 2012 reëlection race, she carried Greene County, which includes Springfield, by four points, and won the election by almost fifteen points. In the 2016 Presidential race, Hillary Clinton lost Greene County by almost thirty points. This year, McCaskill is counting on winning the voters who supported her in 2012 and went for Trump four years later."],["inline-embed",{"type":"callout","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22callout%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22inset-left%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22cartoon%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522cartoon%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%2522%252Fcartoon%252F5bca4a5989a5e048821cf61e%2522%252C%2522width%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522height%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522caption%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%225bca4a5989a5e048821cf61e%5C%22%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%22%2C%22attrs%22%3A%7B%7D%7D","ref":""},["inline-embed",{"type":"cartoon","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22cartoon%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22%2Fcartoon%2F5bca4a5989a5e048821cf61e%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":"5bca4a5989a5e048821cf61e"}]],["p","For those accustomed to experiencing Democratic politics through the lens of MSNBC or the New York ",["em","Times"],", the dinner in Springfield would have seemed surreal. Donald Trump hovered over the proceedings as He Who Must Not Be Named. After the Pledge of Allegiance and the “Star-Spangled Banner,” speaker after speaker made no mention of Trump—or, for that matter, of Robert Mueller, Stormy Daniels, Russian interference in the 2016 elections, #MeToo, or impeachment. Instead, they described the Democrats as the party that would help you pay your medical bills and your kids’ college tuition. Only Josh Earnest, formerly a press secretary for President Obama, let slip the President’s name."],["p","When McCaskill got to the lectern, she reminded everyone that she was a local girl, originally from the Ozarks. Then, avoiding even the word “Republican,” she said, “We have got to be very careful going down this road. It’s not going to be enough to complain about them. We’ve got to remind people what we’re for.” But she did complain about Republicans, saying that they have slashed health-care benefits, given tax cuts to the rich, imposed tariffs on American corn and soybeans and pork, allowed pharmaceutical companies to overcharge for prescription drugs, and threatened public education and union organizing. “We stand with the people who take a shower after work, and not before work,” she declared, as the audience cheered. “We stand with the men and women who try to make it work every month.”"],["p","McCaskill deftly filleted Josh Hawley, who has been in his job since 2016, by implicitly contrasting her years of experience with his jejune overconfidence. “Let’s talk about Josh,” she said. “Josh made two promises when he ran for attorney general. He looked at the camera and said, ‘I’m not a politician. I’m not running for one office to turn around and run for another.’ ” Yet here he was, two years later, running for the Senate. “The second promise he made was that he was going to go after public corruption. How’s that worked out?” Hawley had been slow to investigate corruption charges against state officials, including Missouri’s former Republican governor Eric Greitens, who resigned last May, after a woman with whom he was having an extramarital affair accused him of sexual assault. (Greitens denies the assault.) McCaskill is very good at convincing people that she’s more candid and less high and mighty than most politicians. Continuing her remarks about Hawley, she said, “He looks good!” Hawley is slim and muscular, attributes that don’t necessarily matter to Missouri voters. “I didn’t go to Yale Law School”—Hawley’s alma mater. “I went to Mizzou Law School, but I can keep up.” She said that she had worked as a waitress to help pay for school, then talked about fund-raising: “My average donation is seventy bucks. Hawley’s average donation, it has a comma in it. That’s the difference.” (She was exaggerating for effect—Hawley’s average donation doesn’t actually have a comma in it.)"],["p","Eventually, she got to Trump. “When I’m at the grocery store,” she said, “before I even get to the butcher—I’m still in produce—some people used to walk up to me and say, ‘Hi, Claire, I think you’re doing a good job,’ or maybe they don’t think I’m doing a good job. You know what they do now? They grab me and say, ‘Save us! Please save us!’ ” This was extra-points political practice: McCaskill was planting the idea that Trump is a horror without owning the criticism, while also indicating that she lives pretty much the same kind of life her constituents do. She said that in the state legislature, where she was known for cursing with abandon, her senior colleagues put a swear jar on her desk. We ought to have a Trump swear jar, she said. “When people come up to you and start talking about Donald Trump, you need to tell them about the Trump swear jar. They have to put five dollars in the Trump swear jar every time they want to talk about Donald Trump. The Trump swear jar is located at ClaireMcCaskill.com!” The audience roared."]],["inline-embed",{"type":"section","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22section%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cp%3ESouthern%20Missouri%20was%20once%20staunchly%20Democratic%2C%20but%20in%20the%20course%20of%20McCaskill%E2%80%99s%20life%20it%20has%20been%20moving%20steadily%20to%20the%20right.%20When%20I%20met%20with%20her%20in%20Washington%2C%20she%20told%20me%20that%20she%20first%20began%20to%20realize%20that%20her%20family%20was%20out%20of%20step%20with%20its%20neighbors%20when%20Kennedy%20ran%20for%20President%2C%20in%201960.%20%E2%80%9CDad%20was%20a%20Democratic%20committeeman%2C%20and%20somebody%20threw%20a%20rock%20through%20the%20window%20of%20the%20county%20Democratic%20headquarters.%20It%20was%20bigotry%E2%80%94about%20%5BJ.F.K.%E2%80%99s%5D%20being%20a%20Catholic.%E2%80%9D%20She%20recounted%20the%20history%20of%20the%20country%E2%80%99s%20political%20realignment%3A%20%E2%80%9CThere%20was%20a%20cataclysmic%20shifting%20when%20we%20decided%20that%20civil%20rights%20was%20the%20cause%20of%20our%20party.%20Missouri%2C%20along%20with%20the%20traditional%20Democratic%20Southern%20states%2C%20began%20to%20shift.%E2%80%9D%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EIn%20the%20nineteen-eighties%2C%20when%20she%20was%20in%20the%20state%20legislature%2C%20there%20were%20still%20rural%20Democrats%20who%20felt%20that%20the%20Party%20cared%20about%20their%20economic%20interests%20and%20Republicans%20didn%E2%80%99t.%20%E2%80%9CNo%20more%2C%E2%80%9D%20McCaskill%20said.%20%E2%80%9CNow%20there%E2%80%99s%20a%20much%20brighter%20dividing%20line%20between%20rural%20and%20urban.%20A%20lot%20of%20people%20gave%20up%20on%20me.%20They%20gave%20up%20on%20us.%E2%80%9D%20She%20acknowledged%20the%20seductive%20simplicity%20of%20Trump%E2%80%99s%20message.%20%E2%80%9CThere%20used%20to%20be%20a%20way%20to%20work%20your%20way%20up%20from%20the%20mailroom.%20Now%20there%E2%80%99s%20no%20more%20mailroom%2C%E2%80%9D%20she%20said.%20%E2%80%9CDonald%20Trump%20gave%20voters%20a%20place%20to%20put%20their%20anger.%E2%80%9D%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EBy%20the%20time%20McCaskill%20was%20in%20ninth%20grade%2C%20at%20Hickman%20High%20School%2C%20in%20Columbia%2C%20she%20had%20set%20her%20sights%20on%20becoming%20the%20first%20female%20governor%20of%20Missouri.%20During%20a%20speech%20contest%2C%20she%20gave%20a%20talk%20condemning%20the%20Ku%20Klux%20Klan%2C%20and%20felt%20%E2%80%9Cthe%20incredible%20high%20when%20the%20thunderous%20applause%20came%20at%20the%20end%20of%20the%20speech.%E2%80%9D%20When%20she%20was%20a%20senior%2C%20she%20ran%20in%20her%20first%20election%2C%20for%20homecoming%20queen.%20In%20her%20memoir%2C%20she%20describes%20the%20event%20as%20a%20formative%20experience%20in%20retail%20politics.%20The%20voters%20were%20the%20members%20of%20the%20football%20team%2C%20and%20she%20launched%20a%20months-long%20campaign%20to%20win%20them%20over.%20%E2%80%9CI%20paid%20them%20special%20attention%2C%20did%20favors%2C%20arranged%20dates%2C%E2%80%9D%20she%20writes%2C%20and%20%E2%80%9Calthough%20I%20wanted%20others%20to%20believe%20I%20won%20because%20I%20was%20popular%2C%20in%20fact%20I%20had%20carried%20out%20an%20effective%20political%20operation%20by%20identifying%20a%20constituency%20and%20working%20hard%20to%20gain%20its%20support.%E2%80%9D%20She%20practices%20grownup%20politics%20the%20same%20way%3A%20be%20practical%2C%20be%20clever%2C%20don%E2%80%99t%20venture%20too%20far%20left%20or%20right%2C%20and%20work%20harder%20than%20anybody%20else.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EUnder%20the%20old%20rules%2C%20McCaskill%20would%20have%20built-in%20advantages%20this%20year%3A%20the%20President%E2%80%99s%20party%20usually%20loses%20seats%20in%20Congress%20in%20a%20midterm%20election%2C%20and%20voters%20tend%20to%20stick%20with%20incumbents.%20In%20national%20generic%20surveys%2C%20the%20Democratic%20Party%20has%20been%20consistently%20beating%20the%20Republican%20Party%2C%20by%20more%20than%20ten%20points%20in%20some%20polls.%20The%20question%20is%20whether%20politics%20has%20changed.%20The%20polarization%20of%20the%20electorate%20has%20been%20increasing%20for%20a%20generation%3B%20people%20used%20to%20be%20far%20more%20comfortable%20voting%20for%20a%20President%20from%20one%20party%20and%20a%20senator%20from%20the%20other.%20Gary%20Jacobson%2C%20a%20political%20scientist%20at%20the%20University%20of%20California%2C%20San%20Diego%2C%20and%20a%20leading%20expert%20on%20congressional%20elections%2C%20says%20that%20the%20advantage%20for%20an%20incumbent%20has%20fallen%20from%20eight%20or%20nine%20points%20to%20two%20or%20three%E2%80%94the%20lowest%20it%20has%20been%20in%20decades.%20And%20that%20situation%20leads%20to%20another%20question%3A%20If%20there%20aren%E2%80%99t%20as%20many%20swing%20voters%20as%20there%20used%20to%20be%2C%20should%20each%20party%20respond%20by%20pursuing%20a%20more%20ideological%20approach%2C%20looking%20past%20local%20issues%20and%20trying%20to%20awaken%20the%20unruly%20passions%20of%20its%20voters%3F%20This%20is%20a%20question%20that%20political%20spectators%

Missouri was once staunchly Democratic, but in the course of McCaskill’s life it has been moving steadily to the right. When I met with her in Washington, she told me that she first began to realize that her family was out of step with its neighbors when Kennedy ran for President, in 1960. “Dad was a Democratic committeeman, and somebody threw a rock through the window of the county Democratic headquarters. It was bigotry—about [J.F.K.’s] being a Catholic.” She recounted the history of the country’s political realignment: “There was a cataclysmic shifting when we decided that civil rights was the cause of our party. Missouri, along with the traditional Democratic Southern states, began to shift.”"],["p","In the nineteen-eighties, when she was in the state legislature, there were still rural Democrats who felt that the Party cared about their economic interests and Republicans didn’t. “No more,” McCaskill said. “Now there’s a much brighter dividing line between rural and urban. A lot of people gave up on me. They gave up on us.” She acknowledged the seductive simplicity of Trump’s message. “There used to be a way to work your way up from the mailroom. Now there’s no more mailroom,” she said. “Donald Trump gave voters a place to put their anger.”"],["p","By the time McCaskill was in ninth grade, at Hickman High School, in Columbia, she had set her sights on becoming the first female governor of Missouri. During a speech contest, she gave a talk condemning the Ku Klux Klan, and felt “the incredible high when the thunderous applause came at the end of the speech.” When she was a senior, she ran in her first election, for homecoming queen. In her memoir, she describes the event as a formative experience in retail politics. The voters were the members of the football team, and she launched a months-long campaign to win them over. “I paid them special attention, did favors, arranged dates,” she writes, and “although I wanted others to believe I won because I was popular, in fact I had carried out an effective political operation by identifying a constituency and working hard to gain its support.” She practices grownup politics the same way: be practical, be clever, don’t venture too far left or right, and work harder than anybody else."],["p","Under the old rules, McCaskill would have built-in advantages this year: the President’s party usually loses seats in Congress in a midterm election, and voters tend to stick with incumbents. In national generic surveys, the Democratic Party has been consistently beating the Republican Party, by more than ten points in some polls. The question is whether politics has changed. The polarization of the electorate has been increasing for a generation; people used to be far more comfortable voting for a President from one party and a senator from the other. Gary Jacobson, a political scientist at the University of California, San Diego, and a leading expert on congressional elections, says that the advantage for an incumbent has fallen from eight or nine points to two or three—the lowest it has been in decades. And that situation leads to another question: If there aren’t as many swing voters as there used to be, should each party respond by pursuing a more ideological approach, looking past local issues and trying to awaken the unruly passions of its voters? This is a question that political spectators have spent the year debating; for McCaskill, it’s a matter of political life and death."],["p","Like many successful people, McCaskill has the ability to stay focussed on one thing. In 1971, she entered the University of Missouri, where she majored in political science, and decided to stay there for law school, because, she writes, “I knew that being part of the network of lawyers in Missouri would help me more with any future political campaigns.” After graduating from law school, in 1978, she worked in an appeals court in Kansas City, and then, in 1982, she ran for the state House of Representatives, and won. She was one of twenty-five female legislators, and one of two female lawyers. “She came in as a firebrand,” Gracia Yancey Backer, who joined the legislature at the same time, told me. “She had to fight the good old boys.” One high-ranking colleague called her a whore on the floor of the House, and another told her that if she wanted his help with a bill she’d have to bring her kneepads. McCaskill made crime her signature issue, successfully proposing a “bill of rights” for crime victims and a tightening of parole eligibility for people convicted of violent crimes. Her positions gave her a tough image in the male-dominated legislature and, as she proudly reports in her memoir, earned her the nickname Hang ’em High

1984, McCaskill married a charming soon-to-be-failed auto dealer named David Exposito. Four years later, she left the legislature and moved back to Kansas City to run for county prosecutor. She was a formidable campaigner, and cruised to victory. On the job, she was obsessively hardworking: she started a drug-treatment program, a domestic-violence program, and a campaign against meth dealers. She boasted in her reëlection campaign, in 1996, that she had put more people in jail than any other county prosecutor in Missouri. The Fraternal Order of Police, usually a Republican group, endorsed her, and she won the race with more than seventy per cent of the vote."],["p","Exposito embarrassed McCaskill in 1994, when he was arrested for smoking marijuana. The following year, she told him that she wanted a divorce, and presented him with the paperwork. After “a brief but harmless outburst of anger,” she writes, he signed the divorce papers without reading them. (In 2005, in a high-crime area of Kansas City, Exposito was shot in the neck and pulled from a moving car. Police suspected that the assault was part of a carjacking, but the crime was never solved.) In 1998, McCaskill ran for state auditor, an office that she saw as a stepping stone to the governorship. She was a single mother with three children, ages ten, nine, and six; she sometimes put them in the car at bedtime, drove to the town where she was next scheduled to give a campaign speech, and checked them all into a motel, sleeping four to a bed. She won a tight race against a more established Republican opponent, and eagerly pursued a new set of targets: wasteful state boards and commissions, greedy nursing homes, sales-tax evaders."],["p","A few years later, McCaskill married Joseph Shepard, a wealthy businessman, who was a Republican at the time, and moved in with him in St. Louis. Unlike Exposito, Shepard supported her ambitions, emotionally and financially. Not long after they were married, she was elected by a large margin to a second term as state auditor, and she thought that in 2004 she could finally run for governor. Shepard told her that he would contribute a million dollars to her campaign, and wound up contributing significantly more."],["p","First, she would have to win a primary against the Democratic incumbent, Bob Holden. To McCaskill, he looked like a sure loser: after holding an excessively lavish inaugural party, he had cut state spending and proposed a tax increase. Primary challengers almost always come from the more ideological wing of their party, and they usually don’t win. McCaskill challenged Holden from the center, addressing middle-class voters’ frustration with the political establishment. Holden, who is now retired from politics, looks back on the race as an early indicator of the trajectory of Missouri politics. “Trump carried eighteen of twenty states in the middle of the country,” he said. “That’s where you’ve seen manufacturing jobs leave. People are scared of what they see happening. Drugs and crime are going up. It threatens the fundamental emotional family structure. Many of these areas were Democratic for years. It’s the legacy of being in power. School taxes go up. Jobs continue to leave. It’s frustration with the way things are going.” McCaskill beat Holden, fifty-two per cent to forty-five. Representative Richard Gephardt, the House Majority Leader at the time, who had initially discouraged her from running, told me, “She’s tough as nails. She is a very effective human being.”"],["p","McCaskill expected a relatively easy race against the Republican nominee, Matt Blunt, Missouri’s thirty-four-year-old secretary of state. Missouri politics is a family business: Blunt’s grandfather once defeated McCaskill’s mother in a race for a seat in the state legislature, and his father, Roy Blunt, is now Missouri’s other U.S. senator. “It was as if I had been climbing a mountain and the clouds had parted just enough for me to see the summit,” she writes. “I was so close I could almost touch it.” Late in the campaign season, McCaskill learned that John Kerry, the Democratic Presidential nominee, who was polling behind George W. Bush, didn’t think he had a chance to carry Missouri and was taking all his campaign’s resources out of the state, leaving her with little organizational support. Roy Temple, who managed Holden’s campaign that year, had warned McCaskill that if she beat Holden by running against the Democratic establishment Blunt could run against her with the same pitch. He was right. For the first time in her career, McCaskill lost, by three percentage points."],["p","Temple remembers getting a voice-mail message from McCaskill late on Election Night, saying, “Roy, I just got my ass kicked. Come work for me.” (He did.) She told me that she was devastated by the defeat: “I drank too much red wine and ate too many cookies for months.” McCaskill concluded that she had made a catastrophic mistake in assuming that she could win by running up big margins in St. Louis and Kansas City and ceding rural Missouri to the Republican candidate. In a conversation with me, over breakfast in a Kansas City hotel, she said, “I did take shortcuts, in terms of not going out to every part of the state, making sure the people of Missouri know me. The lesson was I need to go everywhere in the state. Many mistakes are mistakes of overconfidence. I’ve learned don’t take anything for granted.” If, today, McCaskill seems almost eccentric in her devotion to campaigning in rural parts of Missouri that she isn’t likely to win, the explanation is that she’s haunted by what happened in 2004."],["p","In 2006, the two senior Democrats in the Senate, Schumer and Harry Reid, persuaded her to run against a Republican incumbent, Jim Talent. Her timing was good: President Bush’s dismal approval ratings helped the Democrats pick up enough seats to win majorities in both houses of Congress.

During the primary season, she decided that a right-wing candidate, Todd Akin, would be the easiest to beat in the general election. With the aim of increasing his popularity on the right, she put $1.7 million (more than he spent on his entire campaign) into TV and radio ads warning voters that Akin was dangerously conservative. He won the Republican primary, and then she waited for him to screw up. A few weeks later, on a Sunday-morning interview show, Akin defended his opposition to abortion even in cases of rape by claiming that a woman won’t get pregnant “if it’s a legitimate rape.” McCaskill is forthrightly pro-choice, but Missouri has many anti-abortion voters, and she avoids the issue when campaigning. Akin’s completely unacceptable position played to her advantage, without her having to say much herself. Other blunders by Akin followed, and McCaskill won by fifteen points."],["p","Given the precipitate decline of the Democratic Party in Missouri, McCaskill’s victories have been remarkable. Republicans have created a network of county officeholders who can help their local candidates win campaigns. Their efforts have been boosted by the proliferation of evangelical churches in the state. By 2006, when McCaskill was elected to the Senate, Republicans had majorities in both houses of the Missouri legislature. In 2008, Barack Obama, whom McCaskill had endorsed early and actively campaigned for, lost Missouri by only half a point. In 2012, he lost by almost ten points, and, in 2016, Trump won by almost twenty, with Republicans beating Democrats in every statewide election. There is only one other remaining Democratic state official in Missouri—Nicole Galloway, who holds McCaskill’s old job as state auditor—and the polls have her well behind in her race this

many senators, McCaskill doesn’t live for the opportunity to take on the global challenges of the age. As recently as 2015, she considered returning to Missouri for another try at the governorship. Her mind naturally goes to practical details rather than to big concepts. Her idea of governing is to spend money wisely, punish misbehavior, and give people what they need in order to get through their daily lives."],["p","In her first year in the Senate, she modelled herself on Missouri’s most successful Democratic politician, Harry Truman, by getting appointed to the Armed Services Committee and holding hearings on fraud by military contractors. These maneuvers weren’t just showboating—she helped push through a major reform of military contracting, which required more public disclosure and limited the length of the contracts. But the initiatives also enabled her to establish herself as an advocate for taxpayers and for members of the military. She relentlessly criticized contractors’ misdeeds in Iraq, but was reluctant to criticize the war itself. In 2006, unlike most Democratic Senate candidates, she did not run an anti-Iraq War ad."],["p","She still crusades tirelessly on behalf of military veterans. I attended a campaign event for veterans at a union hall in Joplin, Missouri, where McCaskill ran through a long list of what she has accomplished for veterans over the years. She said that, if anybody tries to mess with veterans in the future, “they’re gonna run into a roadblock with me.” She went on, “And, by the way, I’m not doing this because ",["em","I"]," think it’s the right thing to do. It’s because ",["em","you"]," think it’s the right thing to do.”"],["p","On issues that women care fiercely about, McCaskill tends to blend prosecutorial zeal with political centrism. In 2013, she led a charge against sexual assault in the military. Her chief ally was Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, of New York. They agreed on the need for much stricter policies, but not about who should make the final decision to proceed with a prosecution. Gillibrand argued that military lawyers should decide; McCaskill thought that it should be up to commanders. McCaskill was furious that this stance led to her being seen—even by Harry Reid, the Senate Majority Leader—as breaking ranks with her female colleagues. She’d done research and concluded that commanders were likely to be tougher on rapists than lawyers would. “No one in the Senate had held hands with more victims in the courtroom than I had,” she writes. “No one had come close to the years of prosecutorial experience I’d had putting rapists in prison. The notion that I was going to be characterized as coddling commanders and fighting against victims was enough to make me physically ill.” Gillibrand’s bill, which would have put military rape in the hands of a separate and independent system, didn’t pass, and in 2015 she and McCaskill joined forces to propose harsher penalties for perpetrators of sexual assault on college campuses."],["p","McCaskill’s relationship with Hillary Clinton, the dominant female politician of her generation, is complicated, and reflects the fine line she walks as both a Democrat and a Missourian. In 2006, during McCaskill’s first Senate campaign, she was skeptical about Clinton’s plans to run for President. As Jeffrey Goldberg reported in this magazine, she argued that the Democratic Party needed a candidate who would be competitive in all fifty states—meaning that she didn’t think that Clinton would do well in Missouri. A few months later, during a nationally televised debate on “Meet the Press” between McCaskill and Jim Talent, Tim Russert asked McCaskill whether she thought Bill Clinton had been a great President. She said crisply, “I think he’s been a great leader, but I don’t want my daughter near him.” The following night, McCaskill was scheduled to hold a fund-raiser in New York, with Hillary Clinton as the featured speaker. In the wake of “Meet the Press,” Clinton cancelled. Early in McCaskill’s time in the Senate, Clinton took her to lunch in the Senate dining room and told her that she’d heard McCaskill was considering endorsing Obama in 2008. McCaskill reminded Clinton that Obama had campaigned ardently for her in 2006 and Clinton hadn’t. She soon endorsed Obama. Still, when Clinton ran for President again, McCaskill was one of her first endorsers—a full three years before the election."],["p","McCaskill likes to say that much of her campaign’s money—thirty-one million dollars so far—comes from small online donors. But Hawley, whose campaign has raised only $8.5 million, often points out another fact, which she doesn’t advertise: that much of her money comes from liberals outside Missouri. One of McCaskill’s biggest contributors is Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer of Facebook. Obama made the first fund-raising appearance of his post-Presidency on McCaskill’s behalf, at an event this past May, in Beverly Hills, hosted by, among others, J. J. Abrams, Jeffrey Katzenberg, and Steven Spielberg."],["p","McCaskill is well aware of the boundaries of what Missouri voters will accept, especially the Trump voters she is pursuing most aggressively. She claims to be at the exact ideological midpoint of all hundred senators. Her signature initiatives—such as the Senior $afe Act, co-sponsored with Susan Collins, of Maine, which protects older Americans against financial predation—tend to be laws she can put forward with a Republican, meant to help some category of hardworking middle-class people. McCaskill has disappointed the left by voting against environmental measures likely to be unpopular with her constituents. She supported the Keystone pipeline and opposed cap-and-trade as a means of limiting carbon emissions, because, she told me, in Missouri “many people are unprepared for the increase in utility costs” that she believed cap-and-trade would entail. In her memoir, she complains that the big Democratic donors who have been so helpful to her Senate campaigns have become “more rigid ideologically,” meaning more liberal: “I’m referring to wealthy people who don’t live in Missouri, who’ve never been to Missouri, and who don’t understand Missouri.”"]],["inline-embed",{"type":"section","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22section%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cp%3EDuring%20the%20unrest%20in%20Ferguson%2C%20in%202014%2C%20after%20the%20murder%20of%20Michael%20Brown%2C%20an%20unarmed%20black%20teen-ager%2C%20by%20a%20white%20police%20officer%2C%20the%20Democratic%20governor%2C%20Jay%20Nixon%2C%20an%20old%20rival%20of%20McCaskill%E2%80%99s%2C%20stressed%20the%20need%20to%20restore%20order.%20McCaskill%2C%20who%20had%20proved%20her%20law-and-order%20credentials%20when%20she%20was%20a%20prosecutor%20in%20Kansas%20City%2C%20was%20more%20critical%20of%20the%20police.%20She%20issued%20a%20statement%20that%20said%2C%20%E2%80%9CThis%20kind%20of%20response%20by%20the%20police%20has%20become%20the%20problem%20instead%20of%20the%20solution.%20I%20obviously%20respect%20law%20enforcement%E2%80%99s%20work%20to%20provide%20public%20safety%2C%20but%20my%20constituents%20are%20allowed%20to%20have%20peaceful%20protests%2C%20and%20the%20police%20need%20to%20respect%20that%20right%20and%20protect%20that%20right.%E2%80%9D%20The%20following%20year%2C%20she%20co-sponsored%20a%20bill%E2%80%94with%20three%20Democrats%20and%20no%20Republicans%E2%80%94designed%20to%20reduce%20the%20use%20of%20military%20equipment%20and%20techniques%20by%20local%20police%20forces%2C%20but%20it%20didn%E2%80%99t%20pass.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EThis%20year%2C%20McCaskill%E2%80%99s%20relations%20with%20black%20Missourians%20have%20been%20strained.%20In%20February%2C%202016%2C%20Bruce%20Franks%2C%20a%20Ferguson%20activist%20who%20ran%20a%20successful%20insurgent%20campaign%20for%20the%20legislature%2C%20declared%20at%20a%20town-hall%20meeting%2C%20%E2%80%9CClaire%20is%20going%20to%20have%20to%20bring%20her%20ass%20to%20St.%20Louis.%E2%80%9D%20This%20past%20March%2C%20McCaskill%20asked%20a%20number%20of%20black%20politicians%20to%20sign%20a%20public%20letter%20of%20support%20for%20her%2C%20but%20all%20of%20them%20declined.%20Over%20the%20summer%2C%20I%20spoke%20to%20Felicia%20Pulliam%2C%20a%20consultant%20in%20St.%20Louis%20who%20is%20a%20member%20of%20the%20Ferguson%20Commission%2C%20which%20Governor%20Nixon%20set%20up%20after%20Michael%20Brown%E2%80%99s%20death.%20%E2%80%9CI%20have%20not%20seen%20her%20campaign%20in%20the%20community%2C%E2%80%9D%20she%20said.%20%E2%80%9CI%20know%20she%20has%20spent%20a%20lot%20of%20time%20in%20rural%20communities%20where%20there%20is%20an%20obvious%20challenge%20to%20her%20position.%20It%20feels%20like%20a%20Democratic%20leader%20taking%20for%20granted%20the%20ongoing%20support%20of%20urban%20communities.%20Why%20would%20I%20knock%20on%20doors%2C%20in%20the%20sweltering%20July%20heat%3F%20Where%20am%20I%3F%20I%E2%80%99m%20not%20there.%20The%20alternative%20is%20so%20scary%20that%20the%20only%20choice%20is%20to%20vote%20for%20McCaskill.%20Am%20I%20going%20to%20vote%20for%20Senator%20McCaskill%3F%20I%20am.%20Is%20it%20because%20I%E2%80%99m%20thrilled%20about%20her%3F%20No.%20Unh-unh.%E2%80%9D%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EMcCaskill%20reacted%20to%20her%20troubles%20in%20St.%20Louis%20by%20meeting%20with%20Franks%20and%20with%20the%20officials%20who%20wouldn%E2%80%99t%20sign%20the%20letter%20of%20support.%20She%20visited%20black%20churches%2C%20and%20opened%20a%20campaign%20office%20in%20Ferguson.%20But%20the%20way%20she%20is%20conducting%20the%20campaign%20demonstrates%20that%20she%20believes%20her%20best%20path%20to%20victory%20is%20in%20persuading%20a%20number%20of%20Trump%20voters%20to%20support%20her.%20%E2%80%9CLook%20at%20how%20many%20people%20voted%20for%20Romney%20and%20me%2C%E2%80%9D%20McCaskill%20said.%20%E2%80%9CThose%20are%20the%20ones%20who%20decide%20elections.%20Those%20need%20to%20be%20my%20people%20in%20this%20election.%E2%80%9D%20In%20another%20conversation%2C%20she%20said%2C%20%E2%80%9CThe%20way%20I%20look%20at%20it%20is%2C%20most%20Missourians%20like%20my%20approach%20to%20governing.%20They%20agree%20about%20compromising%20and%20getting%20things%20done.%20The%20extremes%20are%20not%20really%20helpful.%E2%80%9D%20She%20went%20on%2C%20%E2%80%9CI%20work%20hard%20at%20motivation%2C%20and%20I%20work%20hard%20at%20persuasion.%20The%20persuasion%20part%20is%20who%20I%20am.%E2%80%9D%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3ELast%20year%2C%20unlike%20most%20other%20Democrats%20from%20deep-red%20states%2C%20McCaskill%20voted%20against%20the%20Supreme%20Court%20nomination%20of%20Neil%20Gorsuch%2C%20but%20explained%20her%20vote%20carefully.%20She%20told%20voters%2C%20as%20she%20told%20me%2C%20that%20she%E2%80%99d%20made%20up%20her%20mind%20after%20questioning%20Gorsuch%20during%20his%20confirmation%20hearings%20about%20a%202016%20case%20involving%20a%20truck%20driver%20named%20Alphonse%20Maddin%2C%20whose%20rig%20had%20broken%20down%20on%20a%20below-zero%20night.%20He%20had%20left%20the%20truck%20to%20find%20help%2C%20and%20was%20fired%20for%20abandoning%20his%20post.%20The%20driver%20sued%20the%20company%20for%20wrongful%20dismissal%2C%20and%20the%20Tenth%20Circuit%20Court%20of%20Appeals%20decided%20in%

the unrest in Ferguson, in 2014, after the murder of Michael Brown, an unarmed black teen-ager, by a white police officer, the Democratic governor, Jay Nixon, an old rival of McCaskill’s, stressed the need to restore order. McCaskill, who had proved her law-and-order credentials when she was a prosecutor in Kansas City, was more critical of the police. She issued a statement that said, “This kind of response by the police has become the problem instead of the solution. I obviously respect law enforcement’s work to provide public safety, but my constituents are allowed to have peaceful protests, and the police need to respect that right and protect that right.” The following year, she co-sponsored a bill—with three Democrats and no Republicans—designed to reduce the use of military equipment and techniques by local police forces, but it didn’t pass."],["p","This year, McCaskill’s relations with black Missourians have been strained. In February, 2016, Bruce Franks, a Ferguson activist who ran a successful insurgent campaign for the legislature, declared at a town-hall meeting, “Claire is going to have to bring her ass to St. Louis.” This past March, McCaskill asked a number of black politicians to sign a public letter of support for her, but all of them declined. Over the summer, I spoke to Felicia Pulliam, a consultant in St. Louis who is a member of the Ferguson Commission, which Governor Nixon set up after Michael Brown’s death. “I have not seen her campaign in the community,” she said. “I know she has spent a lot of time in rural communities where there is an obvious challenge to her position. It feels like a Democratic leader taking for granted the ongoing support of urban communities. Why would I knock on doors, in the sweltering July heat? Where am I? I’m not there. The alternative is so scary that the only choice is to vote for McCaskill. Am I going to vote for Senator McCaskill? I am. Is it because I’m thrilled about her? No. Unh-unh.”"],["p","McCaskill reacted to her troubles in St. Louis by meeting with Franks and with the officials who wouldn’t sign the letter of support. She visited black churches, and opened a campaign office in Ferguson. But the way she is conducting the campaign demonstrates that she believes her best path to victory is in persuading a number of Trump voters to support her. “Look at how many people voted for Romney and me,” McCaskill said. “Those are the ones who decide elections. Those need to be my people in this election.” In another conversation, she said, “The way I look at it is, most Missourians like my approach to governing. They agree about compromising and getting things done. The extremes are not really helpful.” She went on, “I work hard at motivation, and I work hard at persuasion. The persuasion part is who I am.”"],["p","Last year, unlike most other Democrats from deep-red states, McCaskill voted against the Supreme Court nomination of Neil Gorsuch, but explained her vote carefully. She told voters, as she told me, that she’d made up her mind after questioning Gorsuch during his confirmation hearings about a 2016 case involving a truck driver named Alphonse Maddin, whose rig had broken down on a below-zero night. He had left the truck to find help, and was fired for abandoning his post. The driver sued the company for wrongful dismissal, and the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals decided in his favor. Gorsuch dissented, arguing that a clause in Maddin’s employment contract permitted the company to fire him. “The case was about whether he was removed from employment unfairly,” she said. When she met privately with him, she said, “my exchange with Gorsuch was ‘Did you ever think about what you would do if you were the truck driver?’ Gorsuch said no. I want somebody who will think about the truck driver.” Again in the case of Brett Kavanaugh, McCaskill voted with her party, and took pains to explain her decision in a way that would distinguish her

Hawley has used Democrats’ supposedly unfair treatment of Kavanaugh to pump up his already exuberant rhetorical embrace of national right-wing themes. Unlike McCaskill, who speaks in the same style in speeches, on television, and in her memoir, Hawley can be soothing or stentorian, folksy or intellectual. At a rally in August, at a strip mall in Blue Springs, Missouri, outside Kansas City, he was a hopping-mad, red-meat conservative populist. Tall and thin, wearing his campaign uniform—a dress shirt, bluejeans, a belt with a big buckle, and cowboy boots—he launched into a screed about how McCaskill was threatening the American way of life: “Are we going to be able to keep terrorists out of the country? Are we going to preserve our Second Amendment rights? Claire McCaskill was for every one of Barack Obama’s liberal, far-left Supreme Court nominees. She supported judges who want to keep sanctuary cities. I think we need a U.S. senator who will secure our borders. We’re going to build that wall!” He paused, and shifted to a reverential tone. “The President of the United States was right to say that this is the most important race in the country. You know, the President called me the other day. He said, ‘You’ve got to beat her.’ I said, ‘Mr. President, we’ll get it done.’ ”"],["p","One question facing the voters is just what it means to be élite, which is a very bad thing to be in Missouri politics. Hawley argues that McCaskill is rich, by virtue of being married to Joe Shepard, and powerful—a United States senator with a private plane. McCaskill argues that Hawley had a fancy out-of-state education, with all the cultural baggage that implies. In two early minor social-media triumphs for the McCaskill campaign, somebody with an iPhone took a photograph of Hawley, supposedly during office hours, dressed in a body-hugging T-shirt, buying a bottle of red wine (possibly French) in a store; and Hawley made the mistake of posting a video that showed him working out in a gym, also during office hours. Democratic tweeters felt that the pictures proved that Hawley had profoundly un-Missourian proclivities."],["p","McCaskill is trying to upend the cultural polarity of the 2016 Presidential campaign. She, the Democrat, went to a more modest university, and is selling her unscripted authenticity. Hawley, the Republican, is the Ivy Leaguer trying out different personas depending on which one he thinks will get the best response. McCaskill likes to remind people that Hawley, as a lawyer, wrote arcane law-review articles and appellate briefs; she tried cases in criminal court. She frequently points out that he has never held a town-hall meeting where he fielded questions from people who didn’t agree with him. He’s never helped someone get her Social Security check when it’s stuck in bureaucratic limbo. He has never sat in a room for hours making calls to small-dollar donors. Just about the only time I ever saw McCaskill appear flustered was at a town-hall meeting in Kansas City, when a man got up and said that McCaskill had promised to meet with him to discuss a problem he was having, but when he’d contacted her office nobody had returned the call. McCaskill ordered an aide to get her cell phone, so that she could enter an appointment in her calendar for the next time she was in town."],["p","Like McCaskill, Hawley is a product of small-town Missouri. He grew up in Lexington, fifty miles east of Kansas City. His parents were active Republicans; his mother was a schoolteacher and his father was the president of a local bank. He went to a Jesuit high school in Kansas City, and then to Stanford, where he distinguished himself as brilliant, ambitious, and very conservative and religious. As a freshman, he persuaded David Kennedy, an eminent American historian, to give him an extended tutorial, something that senior faculty members are reluctant to do, on the American Presidency. Kennedy says that Hawley is possibly the most gifted undergraduate student he has taught in a fifty-year career. He directed Hawley’s senior thesis, on Theodore Roosevelt, which Hawley expanded into a book, “Theodore Roosevelt: Preacher of Righteousness.” Yale University Press published it in 2008, before Hawley had turned thirty."],["p","As a senior, Hawley applied for a Rhodes Scholarship, and was turned down. He went to England anyway, to teach at an exclusive boys’ prep school, St. Paul’s. In 2003, he enrolled at Yale Law School, where he was the articles editor of the law review and the president of the school’s chapter of the Federalist Society, the legal organization that counts all five conservative Supreme Court Justices as members. After graduating, he clerked for two federal judges: Michael McConnell, of the Tenth Circuit, and John Roberts, the current Chief Justice. He married another Roberts clerk, Erin Morrow, and worked at Hogan Lovells, a Washington law firm, for a few years. In 2011, the Hawleys returned to Missouri as junior faculty members at the University of Missouri Law School. They joined a Presbyterian church, and had two sons."],["inline-embed",{"type":"callout","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22callout%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22inset-left%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22cartoon%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522cartoon%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%2522%252Fcartoon%252F5bca4a59f4dc8b77a815642a%2522%252C%2522width%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522height%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522caption%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%225bca4a59f4dc8b77a815642a%5C%22%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%22%2C%22attrs%22%3A%7B%7D%7D","ref":""},["inline-embed",{"type":"cartoon","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22cartoon%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22%2Fcartoon%2F5bca4a59f4dc8b77a815642a%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":"5bca4a59f4dc8b77a815642a"}]],["p","Hawley was poised for a bright future in the conservative intellectual legal world—a deanship, a federal judgeship, even the Supreme Court. He has published several intricately reasoned law-review articles, and helped to write the winning brief in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, in which the Court gave a chain of stores owned by evangelical Christians the right to exempt itself from the provision of the Affordable Care Act that requires employers to provide contraceptives to employees. Hawley’s published work shows him to be deeply suspicious of a powerful federal government, protective of property rights, and favoring a return of religion to a more central role in public life. His biography of Roosevelt is unflattering—it’s anything but a standard celebration of T.R. as a vigorous champion of American greatness. It presents him as having scant respect for human rights, an absolute certainty that state power (if exercised by him and other members of the patrician class) is benign, a predilection for violence and war, and creepy eugenic racial views. Like many conservative intellectuals, Hawley believes that the Progressive Era amounted to a disastrous wrong turn, when the administrative apparatus that Roosevelt created superseded the modest, decentralized government envisaged by the Framers. Hawley also objects to the Progressives’ idea that, as he described it in one of his law-review articles, “humane government is possible only when religion is roped off from the public realm.”"],["p","Hawley is one of those promising young men with an extraordinary ability to win over powerful older patrons. In 2016, when he ran for attorney general, he secured $2.7 million for his campaign from David Humphreys, a building-materials magnate. Three months after he took office, former Senator John Danforth, Missouri’s most revered senior Republican, issued a public letter to Hawley, signed by four Republican elders, urging him to run for the Senate against McCaskill in her reëlection race. Vice-President Mike Pence and Senator Mitch McConnell, the Majority Leader, also urged Hawley to run."],["p","In August, 2017, Danforth published an op-ed in the Washington ",["em","Post"]," in which he called on his party to disown Trump. Citing the President’s tendency to incite prejudice against immigrants and people of color, Danforth wrote that he “is exactly what Republicans are not . . . exactly what we have opposed in our 160-year history.” A few weeks later, according to Politico, Stephen Bannon, the chief architect of Trumpism, let it be known that he suspected Josh Hawley of being an establishment Republican, and that he was considering backing somebody else in the primary. Hawley called Bannon, and whatever he said persuaded Bannon to back off. Hawley has accomplished the rare feat of getting the enthusiastic support of the warring elements of the national Republican Party."],["p","The day after I watched Hawley lay into McCaskill in Blue Springs, I went to see him at his campaign headquarters, in Columbia. It had the barren, just-moved-in feeling that campaign offices often have. Taped to the walls were photographs of Ronald Reagan, Winston Churchill, Theodore Roosevelt, and Abraham Kuyper, a nineteenth-century Dutch minister who started a conservative movement away from the Reformed Church and later became Prime Minister of the Netherlands. There were books stacked on desks: Michel Houellebecq’s “Submission,” about an Islamic political party taking power in France; Richard Ben Cramer’s “What It Takes,” a close-up and sympathetic study of the driving ambitions of the leading contenders in the 1988 Presidential campaign. I spotted a couple of files labelled “Yuval”—that’s Yuval Levin, a leading young conservative intellectual in Washington—and “Kevin Williamson,” for the conservative columnist, who was in the news this year for being hired by ",["em","The Atlantic"]," and then quickly fired when it surfaced that he had suggested that a woman who gets an abortion be punished by hanging. The young staff members in the office had the air of committed soldiers in the conservative cause."],["p","Hawley, controlled but intense, can be stinging and blithely misleading when scoring a point. In his first debate with McCaskill, in mid-September, he deployed a right-wing rhetorical trifecta by accusing her of wanting to “force the government to help illegal immigrant teen-agers get abortions,” and asserted, incorrectly, that she and her husband had personally received a hundred and thirty-one million dollars in federal housing subsidies. (Joe Shepard’s company received that money to operate housing complexes.)"],["p","I asked him what he thought Theodore Roosevelt and the Progressives had got wrong. He said, “The great belief in experts who could take government out of politics, and this great belief in science that somehow was value-neutral, and you could remove the hurly-burly from politics and turn it over to experts.” He went on, “It turned out to create a government that was significantly less responsive to the American people.” Hawley presented himself as someone who understands how threatened people feel by the power of government and its corporate allies. During the campaign, he has compared Google and Facebook to the oil, steel, and railroad trusts of the Gilded Age. Today’s liberals, he said, don’t give the place of honor to small communities and associations; they want to centralize political and economic power, on the one hand, and grant the individual complete personal freedom, on the other."],["p","He mentioned his disapproval of the Supreme Court’s 1992 decision in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, which, by a thin margin, upheld the legality of abortion, based on the idea of individual autonomy. “The late-modern idea of liberty,” he said, “is basically that my liberty is the ability to choose what I want, free of any particular community, free of any particular obligations. Whereas I think there’s a longer, richer tradition that sees political liberty, at least, as the ability to exercise control of your life, control of your government, in concert with other people. The liberal conception of liberty is not only individualistic—it’s also apolitical, it’s acommunal, it just sort of floats free on its own. It turns out, well, it’s hard to exercise choice meaningfully unless you are in a community where you can do that together.”"],["p","When Hawley wrote his book about Roosevelt, he couldn’t have foreseen that Donald Trump would become President, but some passages inescapably bring Trump to mind. In one, he writes, “What the strong could take belonged to the strong. It is difficult to imagine a more thorough or repugnant apology for oppressive exploitation.” In another: “New anti-immigration measures became commonplace in many American cities. Discrimination against Catholics, Jews, and other disfavored minority religious groups were all part and parcel of the Progressive project.” I asked whether Trump wasn’t reënacting some of Roosevelt’s unsavory practices."],["p","Hawley said, “Well, I don’t think that the current President shares Theodore Roosevelt’s racialist philosophies. I think there’s quite a gulf there. And certainly Theodore Roosevelt’s focus on Americans and the English-speaking peoples as a sort of master race—it’s sad, because he was a childhood hero of mine. But when you really look carefully at his racial theory there’s really nothing good to say about it. And I think that we as a country repudiated that long ago, and rightly so.” It was a determinedly opaque answer."]],["inline-embed",{"type":"section","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22section%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cp%3EMcCaskill%E2%80%99s%20idea%20of%20how%20to%20win%20isn%E2%80%99t%20as%20exciting%20as%20motivating%20younger%20and%20minority%20voters%20by%20decrying%20the%20misdeeds%20of%20the%20Trump%20Administration.%20But%20as%20Joel%20Benenson%2C%20a%20pollster%20and%20strategist%20who%20played%20a%20leading%20role%20in%20the%20Obama%20and%20Hillary%20Clinton%20Presidential%20campaigns%2C%20told%20me%2C%20%E2%80%9CWe%20are%20a%20politically%20divided%20country.%20You%20don%E2%80%99t%20win%20elections%20without%20winning%20the%20center.%20How%20do%20you%20win%20by%20just%20appealing%20to%20liberal%20Democrats%3F%20You%20don%E2%80%99t.%20The%20notion%20that%20we%20can%20win%20elections%20with%20the%20base%20is%20absurd.%E2%80%9D%20This%20holds%20for%20Democrats%20in%20many%20blue%20states%2C%20too.%20In%20New%20York%2C%20Andrew%20Cuomo%20decisively%20beat%20Cynthia%20Nixon%2C%20his%20Democratic-primary%20opponent%2C%20who%20was%20running%20well%20to%20his%20left%20and%20failed%20to%20connect%20with%20most%20suburban%20and%20upstate%20voters.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EIn%20the%20final%20weeks%20of%20the%20campaign%2C%20McCaskill%20and%20Hawley%20are%20sticking%20to%20their%20scripts.%20Hawley%20constantly%20cites%20his%20allegiance%20to%20Donald%20Trump%2C%20who%20has%20travelled%20to%20Missouri%20to%20campaign%20for%20him%20three%20times%20so%20far%3B%20his%20conviction%20that%20McCaskill%20is%20just%20another%20Washington%20liberal%20Democrat%3B%20and%20his%20admiration%20for%20Brett%20Kavanaugh.%20He%E2%80%99s%20running%20a%20national%20campaign.%20McCaskill%20continues%20to%20hammer%20away%20at%20things%20she%E2%80%99s%20doing%20for%20Missourians%3A%20getting%20better%20rural%20mail%20delivery%2C%20strengthening%20cybersecurity%2C%20improving%20disclosure%20of%20pharmaceutical%20companies%E2%80%99%20drug%20pricing.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EIn%20McCaskill%E2%80%99s%20resolute%20disengagement%20from%20the%20dramas%20in%20Washington%2C%20she%20offers%20herself%20as%20a%20champion%20of%20the%20kinds%20of%20people%20who%20aren%E2%80%99t%20looking%20to%20be%20inspired%2C%20who%20want%20the%20politicians%20they%20vote%20for%20to%20give%20them%20some%20hope%20and%20dignity%20and%20understanding.%20Every%20day%2C%20she%20touts%20another%20small%20accomplishment.%20She%E2%80%99s%20fighting%20for%20a%20mother%20whose%20son%20needs%20a%20bone-marrow%20transplant.%20She%20wants%20to%20raise%20the%20minimum%20wage%20to%20twelve%20dollars%20an%20hour.%20She%20wants%20to%20get%20the%20price%20of%20a%20bushel%20of%20soybeans%20back%20up%20to%20eleven%20dollars%2C%20where%20it%20was%20before%20the%20new%20tariffs%20knocked%20it%20down%20to%20nine%20dollars.%20When%20I%20asked%20her%20what%20kind%20of%20Presidential%20candidate%20the%20Democrats%20should%20be%20seeking%20for%202020%2C%20she%20said%2C%20%E2%80%9CI%20think%20there%E2%80%99s%20a%20lot%20of%20caterwauling%20about%20our%20national%20message.%E2%80%9D%20To%20her%2C%20the%20message%20is%20clear%3A%20%E2%80%9CWe%E2%80%99re%20interested%20in%20protecting%20the%20little%20guy.%20Empowering%20people%20who%20don%E2%80%99t%20have%20the%20power%20to%20get%20things.%20That%E2%80%99s%20the%20essence%20of%20it.%E2%80%9D%20She%E2%80%99s%20convinced%20that%20her%20specific%2C%20practical%20ideas%20get%20closer%20to%20what%20voters%20are%20demanding%20than%20Josh%20Hawley%E2%80%99s%20big%2C%20emotionally%20satisfying%20rhetoric.%20That%E2%80%99s%20McCaskill%E2%80%99s%20future%2C%20if%20she%20has%20a%20future.%20It%20might%20be%20the%20Democrats%E2%80%99%20future%2C%20too.%C2%A0%E2%99%A6%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EAn%20earlier%20version%20of%20this%20article%20misstated%20the%20kind%20of%20church%20Hawley%20and%20his%20wife%20joined%20upon%20moving%20back%20to%20Missouri.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%22%7D","ref":""},["p","McCaskill’s idea of how to win isn’t as exciting as motivating younger and minority voters by decrying the misdeeds of the Trump Administration. But as Joel Benenson, a pollster and strategist who played a leading role in the Obama and Hillary Clinton Presidential campaigns, told me, “We are a politically divided country. You don’t win elections without winning the center. How do you win by just appealing to liberal Democrats? You don’t. The notion that we can win elections with the base is absurd.” This holds for Democrats in many blue states, too. In New York, Andrew Cuomo decisively beat Cynthia Nixon, his Democratic-primary opponent, who was running well to his left and failed to connect with most suburban and upstate voters."],["p","In the final weeks of the campaign, McCaskill and Hawley are sticking to their scripts. Hawley constantly cites his allegiance to Donald Trump, who has travelled to Missouri to campaign for him three times so far; his conviction that McCaskill is just another Washington liberal Democrat; and his admiration for Brett Kavanaugh. He’s running a national campaign. McCaskill continues to hammer away at things she’s doing for Missourians: getting better rural mail delivery, strengthening cybersecurity, improving disclosure of pharmaceutical companies’ drug pricing."],["p","In McCaskill’s resolute disengagement from the dramas in Washington, she offers herself as a champion of the kinds of people who aren’t looking to be inspired, who want the politicians they vote for to give them some hope and dignity and understanding. Every day, she touts another small accomplishment. She’s fighting for a mother whose son needs a bone-marrow transplant. She wants to raise the minimum wage to twelve dollars an hour. She wants to get the price of a bushel of soybeans back up to eleven dollars, where it was before the new tariffs knocked it down to nine dollars. When I asked her what kind of Presidential candidate the Democrats should be seeking for 2020, she said, “I think there’s a lot of caterwauling about our national message.” To her, the message is clear: “We’re interested in protecting the little guy. Empowering people who don’t have the power to get things. That’s the essence of it.” She’s convinced that her specific, practical ideas get closer to what voters are demanding than Josh Hawley’s big, emotionally satisfying rhetoric. That’s McCaskill’s future, if she has a future. It might be the Democrats’ future, too. ♦"],["p","An earlier version of this article misstated the kind of church Hawley and his wife joined upon moving back to Missouri."]]],"canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"sections":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"},"slug":"magazine","children":[{"id":"5bca4a608c9def5c3c6fbe38","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5bca4a608c9def5c3c6fbe38","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Letter from Missouri","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"letter-from-missouri"},{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"},{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"}],"name":"Letter from Missouri","parent":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"},"slug":"letter-from-missouri"}]}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"magazine","contentTags":[],"contentType":"article","contributors":[{"name":"Nicholas Lemann","type":"author","title":"Nicholas Lemann joined \u003cem&gt;The New Yorker\u003c/em&gt; as a staff writer in 1999.","email":"","bio":["div",["p","Nicholas Lemann joined ",["em","The New Yorker"]," as a staff writer in 1999, and has written the Letter from Washington and the Wayward Press columns for the magazine.

Growing up in small-town Oregon as a Korean-American adopted by white parents was a lonely experience, according to the author of this memoir.

What she learns when she makes contact is shocking and upsetting. But it also brings unexpected joy. Chung’s memoir is more than a thoughtful consideration of race and heritage in America.

In this engagingly unacademic meditation, a professor of philosophy interweaves Friedrich Nietzsche’s biography with accounts of his own visits to Sils-Maria, in the Swiss Alps, where Nietzsche spent much of his writing life. Kaag writes of reconciling a hunger for meaningful, extreme experience with mundane reality. Masculinity and its pitfalls are a primary theme, addressed with Knausgaardian frankness: when his wife and daughter come on a mountain trek, he writes of his hope that he won’t one day abandon them. The question, ultimately, is whether Nietzsche’s philosophy, so attuned to lurking monstrous urges, can be of use in daily life.

Cédric, the son of a pharmaceutical magnate, is left quadriplegic after a boating accident, until his father pays for a fame-hungry genius, Dr. Cadavero, to transplant Cédric’s head onto another man’s body. The new Cédric is haunted by questions of selfhood—“If body and soul were the same substance, what would remain of him?”—and embarks on a quest to discover his body’s former identity, leading to clashes with the pharmaceutical industry and the Sicilian Mafia. Despite much satirical hyperbole, real and disturbing questions emerge about how scientific advances exacerbate our yearning for immortality."]],"canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"sections":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"},"slug":"magazine","children":[{"id":"59babd482af19b1403458545","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"59babd482af19b1403458545","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Books","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"books"},{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"},{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"}],"name":"Books","parent":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"},"slug":"books"}]}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"magazine","contentTags":[],"contentType":"article","contributors":[],"dek":"","formatting":{},"hed":"Briefly

something eerie about an empty frame. A vibrant segment of the stock-photo industry would cease to exist were it not for our fear of the void. During the Second World War, many of the Louvre’s paintings were evacuated to the countryside, leaving rooms full of empty rectangles. Germain Bazin, an influential curator at the time, turned his attention to frames, taking advantage of the absence of canvases to devise better ways of framing paintings and even using a portion of the museum’s heating budget—it was closed, after all—to acquire new ones. “Buy frames!” he wrote to Christiane Aulanier, a colleague, in June of 1944. “Tomorrow the Americans will make a clean sweep of the few that will have been left by the Germans!”"],["p","Today, the Louvre possesses one of the world’s largest collections of frames, with around six thousand in use and another three thousand in storage. This year, all of them are being inventoried for the first time, under the direction of Charlotte Chastel-Rousseau, a curator in the Department of Paintings. She and her team recently put together an exhibition, “Regards sur les Cadres” (“Looking at Frames”), which ends next month. The idea is “to interrogate the complex role of the frame,” Chastel-Rousseau said the other day. “The frame must valorize the painting. With a successful frame, you don’t see the frame. But if a frame is too weak, or not up to the level of the painting, it seems improperly hung.”"],["p","Frames, as we know them, became popular in Italy during the Renaissance, when painting began to detach from the wall. (You can’t frame a fresco.) They made art portable, which meant that proud patrons could show off their collections wherever they went.

Chastel-Rousseau, showing a visitor around, started with a sixteenth-century Italian frame that dominated the right wall. Its scrollwork was so pronounced, it looked as though you could pick it up by two leaves, like a dinner tray. Male heads poked out of carved roundels in each corner. “It’s a masterpiece,” Chastel-Rousseau said, pointing to one of the little men. “Here, look at the details of the beard. I find it all the more fascinating because I have no idea for which painting it was ordered.”"],["p","In another room, three still-lifes by ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2000/07/17/stillness"},"Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin"],", the eighteenth-century master, hung in frames of various styles. A Louis XV frame, described by experts as having “pierced scrolling foliate &amp; rocaille corners with diapered ground &amp; floral rinceaux,” had a daintier effect than a Louis XVI frame, made stately by the addition of a cartouche. An eighteenth-century channelled frame had so many borders that each side was as wide as the canvas. Its ornateness contrasted with the austere painting it housed, which depicted a copper cauldron and a trio of eggs. “You can think about frames and paintings the way you think about wine and cooking,” Chastel-Rousseau said. “You can stick with classic pairings, but sometimes a bold, unexpected choice works perfectly.”"],["p","The most prized frame is a frame ",["em","d’origine"],". The next best option is one that approximates the painting’s provenance in both style and era. At the Louvre, the average painting has had around three different frames. “Either we find one in storage, we buy an old frame with the style we’re looking for, or we create a frame,” Chastel-Rousseau said. Two floors below, artisans were at work in the museum’s ",["em","atelier encadrement dorure"],", which handles anything made of gilded wood. A gilder named Elisabeth Grosjean was bent over a huge frame that, until recently, had contained a landscape painting. It had fallen off a wall in an embassy, and some giltwork had snapped off. Grosjean was touching it up with a sheet of twenty-carat-gold leaf that resembled a chewing-gum wrapper. She placed the leaf on a velvet cushion, blew on it to flatten it, cut it with a gilder’s knife, and applied the pieces to the frame with a tiny paintbrush, before coating them with a glue made from rabbit skin. “What’s beautiful is to see the frames by candlelight,” she said. ♦"]]],"canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"sections":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"},"slug":"magazine","children":[{"id":"5bca887f289700364281dbc4","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5bca887f289700364281dbc4","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Picture Perfect Dept.","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"picture-perfect-dept"},{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"},{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"}],"name":"Picture Perfect Dept.","parent":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"},"slug":"picture-perfect-dept"}]}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"magazine","contentTags":[{"name":"Art","url":"/tag/art"},{"name":"Charlotte Chastel-Rousseau","url":"/tag/charlotte-chastel-rousseau"},{"name":"Frames","url":"/tag/frames"},{"name":"Painting","url":"/tag/painting"},{"name":"Louvre","url":"/tag/louvre"},{"name":"Paris, France","url":"/tag/paris-france"}],"contentType":"article","contributors":[{"name":"Lauren Collins","type":"author","title":"Lauren Collins began working at \u003cem&gt;The New Yorker\u003c/em&gt; in 2003 and became a staff writer in 2008.

been estimated that it costs five dollars an hour to be alive in New York City. The rate might go up once you enter this orange-hued parlor for devotees of sophisticated spirits, where a playlist of old, tinny jazz, Frank Sinatra, and bossa nova conjures a cloud of prerevolutionary Cuba. On a recent evening, a young woman wearing owlish glasses strode through curls of smoke produced by the cigar of a man in a blue-and-white polo lounging on the bar’s veranda. Inside, she took a seat at the counter and opened the leather-bound menu, a volume that is rivalled in thickness only by the tome at the Cheesecake Factory, and which lists several cigars, an awe-inspiring variety of cognacs, Armagnacs, and Calvados, and more than one half-century-old single-malt whiskey priced at more than a thousand dollars a pour. “Brandy Library accepts cash, Visa, cash, MasterCard, cash, Diners Club, cash, American Express, and cash,” the woman murmured, reading aloud. “We take Discover now, as well,” a bartender in a navy-blue blazer said, before asking an indecisive patron in a red tube top to order something or relinquish her stool. The bespectacled woman soon received a flight of fiery brandies distilled from pears, grapes, and ginger, and a man sitting beside her asked her opinion on each one. “I love being interrogated,” she replied as she sipped from a snifter and took a picture of a nearby bottle for later study. “Do you know anyone named Framboise?” One dram tasted like bubble gum on a stove, another like baked fruit—thoughts that led to hunger. The woman picked up the menu and noted offerings of steak and tuna tartare. “Everything is raw!” she exclaimed. “That’s how you know it’s fancy.” ",["em","(25 N.

The other is a black-and-white snapshot of a two- or three-year-old girl taken by an anonymous photographer sometime in the nineteen-thirties. She’s sitting on a stone step, dressed in a polka-dotted sunsuit and matching sun hat—her eyes squinting against the sun, her mouth set in a near-smile—and she has assumed Bertin’s pose, as if she had seen the portrait and were mimicking it. Of course, what she has done, and what Bertin himself did, was to unconsciously draw on the repertoire of stereotypical poses with which nature has endowed all creatures, and which we tend to notice less in our own species than we do in, say, cats or squirrels or marmosets."],["inline-embed",{"type":"callout","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22callout%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22feature-xsmall%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22image%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522image%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%2522%252Fphotos%252F5bca23fcec3de0785297a854%2522%252C%2522width%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522height%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522caption%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%225bca23fcec3de0785297a854%5C%22%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%22%2C%22attrs%22%3A%7B%7D%7D","ref":""},["inline-embed",{"type":"image","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22image%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22%2Fphotos%2F5bca23fcec3de0785297a854%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":"5bca23fcec3de0785297a854"}]],["p","Ingres had a lot of trouble with his portrait of Bertin. He made and rejected at least seven studies. According to a biographer, Walter Pach, Ingres broke down in tears during one sitting, and Bertin comforted him by saying, “My dear Ingres, don’t bother about me; and above all don’t torment yourself like that. You want to start my portrait over again? Take your own time for it. You will never tire me, and just as long as you want me to come, I am at your orders.” Finally, Ingres saw Bertin outside the studio—at a dinner, in one account, and at an outdoor café, in another—sitting in ",["em","the"]," pose, and knew that he had his portrait."],["p","The child in the snapshot is me. I know nothing about where or when the picture was taken. The sunsuit speaks of summer vacation, and I am guessing at my age. I say “my” age, but I don’t think of the child as me. No feeling of identification stirs as I look at her round face and her thin arms and her incongruously assertive pose."],["p","If I were writing an autobiography, it would have to begin after the time of that photograph. My first memory dates from a few years later. I am in the country on a fine day in early summer and there is a village festival. Little girls in white dresses are walking in a procession, strewing white rose petals from small baskets. I want to join the procession but have no basket of petals. A kind aunt comes to my aid. She hastily plucks white petals from a bush in her garden and hands me a basket filled with them. I immediately see that the petals are not rose petals but peony petals. I am unhappy. I feel cheated. I feel that I have been given not the real thing but something counterfeit."],["p","I have carried this memory around with me all my life, but never looked at it very hard. What gave this disappointment its status over other childhood sorrows? Why did they fade to nothing, while this one became a vivid memory? Children are conformists. Was being given petals from the “wrong” flower so afflicting because it set me apart from the other children, making me seem different? Or was there something more to the memory than that? Something primitive, symbolic, essential. ",["em","Are"]," roses better than peonies? When I recoiled from the peony petals, had I stumbled on some knowledge of the natural world not otherwise available to a child of five?"],["p","Peonies have a brief blooming season, from late spring to early summer. It is tempting to buy bunches of them at the florist’s, with their lovely tight round buds, pink or white or magenta. But when they open they are blowsy and ugly. You’re sorry you bought them. Sometimes they have a delicious fragrance, but often they don’t smell at all. In the garden, they are battered by rain and smashed down, and have to be staked. Roses bloom all summer and stand up to rain. As they open in the vase, they grow more beautiful. There is no question of their superiority to peonies. The rose is the queen of flowers."],["p","The idea of absolute aesthetic value is a debatable one, of course. I have inclined toward it, but sometimes I turn from it.

black-and-white photograph, three and a half by two and three-quarters inches, shows a man and a woman and a little girl looking out of the window of a train. On the back of the photograph are four handwritten words: “Leaving Prague, July 1939.” The man and the woman are smiling, and the girl has an expression on her face that the Czech word ",["em","mrzutá"]," conveys more powerfully and succinctly than any of its English definitions: cross, grumpy, surly, sulky, sullen, morose, peevish. The onomatopoetic character of ",["em","mrzutá"]," expresses the out-of-sorts feeling that the definitions only gesture toward."],["p","The man and woman are my parents, at the ages of thirty-nine and twenty-nine, and the child is me, at the age of almost five. I have no memory of being on the train. As I look at the picture, I wonder where my sister, Marie, then two and a half, was. Perhaps lying on the seat in the compartment, after crying herself to sleep? In the family lore about the leave-taking, there is a nurse whom my sister was inconsolable about parting from."],["p","The train was headed for Hamburg, where the ocean liner on which we had booked passage to America was docked. It was one of the last civilian ships to leave Europe for America before the outbreak of war. We were among the small number of Jews who escaped the fate of the rest by sheer dumb luck, as a few random insects escape a poison spray. The Nazi bureaucracy that granted us our exit visas in return for bribes (family stories have it that we bought an S.S. man a racehorse) stipulated—to extract more money from us—that we travel first class on the liner. We were not rich. My father was a psychiatrist and a neurologist and my mother was an attorney at a small law firm. There was no family money. When we arrived in America, we were supported by relatives for the first year. At sea, my parents put on evening dress for dinner; Marie and I were left in our cabin in the care of a ship stewardess. I still remember the gown my mother wore to dinner on the ship; perhaps there were others, but this one hung in her closet throughout my childhood. It was dark blue, some sort of appliqué affair. One day, it wasn’t in the closet, and when I asked about it my mother said vaguely that she had got rid of it some time ago with other unwanted clothes. It had evidently not been the charged heirloom for her that it was for me."],["p","My memories of the passage were as vague as hers of the expulsion of the dress. There was a boil on my arm that had to be lanced by the ship surgeon, and midmorning broth served on deck in tin cups to passengers who lay prone under gray-black-and-white plaid blankets. I am struck now by how young my parents were when we emigrated. I always saw their Czech past as a huge rock standing before their American present. I read it as a voluminous text that reduced their life in America to a footnote, although in fact they spent the greater part of their lives in this country. The false idea of my parents as permanent exiles must have come in part from the fact that we spoke Czech at home. The language fostered the impression of their essential foreignness. My paternal grandmother, who knew almost no English, lived with us, and we spoke Czech on her behalf. She had joined us in 1941, when the Nazis allowed certain older Jews to leave Czechoslovakia. Probably money was again the Nazis’ motive. She travelled to Cuba, and then came to us in New York."],["p","The first year in America, spent in my maternal aunt and uncle’s house in Brooklyn, is largely a blank. I have retained no image of the house, inside or outside. I don’t know where we slept or what we ate or did together. My cousins Eva and Helen, who were older and probably resented the intrusion, do not appear to me. The image of a Beatrix Potter book, about which there was a fight, remains as a single unclarifying memento of the house in Brooklyn. But I have distinct memories of the kindergarten into which I was enrolled in September."],["p","These memories are pathetic. They tell of a child not yet familiar with the language of her new country, who was deposited, apparently without explanation, in a class of twenty children and a teacher who believed her to be somehow impaired, what today we would call a “special needs” child. What I needed, of course, was a translator. Probably my mother’s own limited knowledge of English had prevented her from explaining my silent incomprehension to the teacher."],["p","I sat and drew—I have an image of children sitting in low chairs at desks arranged in a circle. But I never quite knew what was going on, and there was one memorable sad consequence of that. I had watched my classmates bring pennies or nickels to the class at regular intervals and give them to the teacher. One day, it became clear what the money was being collected for: an excursion, from which I was excluded because I hadn’t known to ask my parents for the contribution. This may have been my first taste of the complicated, self-punishing experience of regret."],["p","Perhaps the most pathetic example of my hit-and-miss, mostly miss, attempt to grasp English was this: at the end of each day, the pretty kindergarten teacher would say, “Goodbye, children.” I had formed the idea that Children was the name of one of the girls in the class, and I harbored the fantasy that one day I would become the favorite to whom the teacher addressed the parting words—she would say, “Goodbye, Janet.”"],["p","In the summer of 1940, we moved to the Yorkville neighborhood of Manhattan, and I was enrolled in the first grade at P.S. 82, on East Seventieth Street. During our stay in Brooklyn, my father had studied for, and passed, the medical-board examinations that qualified him as a doctor; Yorkville in the East Seventies, with its large working-class Czech population, was a plausible place for a Czech-speaking physician to set up a practice. (The Hungarian and German neighborhoods were in the East Eighties.) My father intended eventually to resume his specialties in psychiatry and neurology, but for the present his only way of supporting a family was to be a village doctor to the Yorkville Czechs. At P.S. 82, I didn’t have the problems I had had in the Brooklyn kindergarten. Somehow, as if by magic, I had acquired my second language. Like my father, although without conscious intent, I had spent that first year studying."],["p","My memories of the early years at this school are as hazy as my memories of the passage to America. The first clear memory is from the fourth grade. A classmate named Jean Rogers slid into a seat next to me and asked if I would be her best friend. Until then, I had had no friends. What Jean Rogers said made me happier than perhaps I had ever been. That her overture had been completely unexpected and unsolicited only heightened its effect on me. The Christian concept of grace comes to mind, and as it does I am transported from the moment of gratuitous bliss—the word “Christian” is the fulcrum—to a painful and shameful reality of my inner life as a child."],["p","When we arrived in America, and were taken under the wing of my aunt and uncle, who had left Prague six months earlier, we changed our name from Wiener to Winn, just as they had changed theirs from Eisner to Edwards, out of fear of anti-Semitism, which was not limited to Nazi Germany. As an extra precaution, my aunt and uncle had joined the Episcopal Church. My parents balked at taking such a step. But they sent Marie and me to a Lutheran Sunday school in our neighborhood, and never did anything or said anything to acquaint us with our Jewishness. Finally, one day, after one of us proudly brought home an anti-Semitic slur learned from a classmate, they decided it was time to tell us that we were Jewish. It was a bit late. We had internalized the anti-Semitism in the culture and were shocked and mortified to learn that we were not on the “good” side of the equation. Many years later, I came to acknowledge and treasure my Jewishness. But during childhood and adolescence I hated and resented and hid it."],["p","The recoil from Jewish identity was not unique to me, of course, as the term “self-hating Jew” attests. But each case of this anxiety disorder is different. Some of the severity of mine could be attributed to my parents’ own confusion about how to represent themselves in their adopted country. In Prague, they knew who they were; they belonged to a community of secular, nationalistic, Czech-speaking Jews who lived confidently among the Czech goyim and were thoroughly identified with Czech culture—as opposed to the community of German-speaking Jews whose most famous member was ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/franz-kafka"},"Franz Kafka"],". That is, ",["em","they thought they knew who they were"],". After the Nazis marched into Prague, in March, 1939, it no longer mattered what kind of Jew you were, whether you spoke German or Czech, lit Hanukkah candles, or, as we did, ate carp soup on Christmas Eve. All Jews were vermin to be exterminated. Some of the Czech Gentiles proved to be less philo-Semitic than they had appeared. Anti-Semitism was a fixture of the Czech state, as it was of every other European state. For example, my father didn’t study literature at Charles University, because the faculty of literature didn’t welcome Jews. He studied medicine instead. The fearfulness that fuelled the change of name from Wiener to Winn was not entirely unwarranted: my parents could not know for sure that they had found a refuge here. By the time they understood that they had, their children’s imaginative life had been deeply affected by their dread."],["p","Who took the picture of my parents and me in the window of the train? I happen to know that it was a distant cousin of my mother’s, a man named Jiří Kašpárek, who had accompanied us to the station. He stayed behind in Czechoslovakia and survived capture and imprisonment for his anti-Nazi activities. He was not Jewish, or not Jewish enough to be on the list of the doomed. After the Communist putsch of 1948, he emigrated to America and lived in Pennsylvania, where he worked as a city planner. I had a romantic feeling about him, romantic in relation to my mother; I felt that there had been something between them, and some of the excitement of their (real or imagined) love affair had been transmitted to me. Jiří and his wife, Zdeňka, would visit us in New York, and my parents visited them in Pennsylvania a few times. It took me many years to realize that he was a deeply earnest man and had certainly never been my mother’s

never knew my maternal grandmother, Klara Munk Taussig, who died, of a pulmonary embolism after a gallbladder operation, when my mother was pregnant with me. I have tried and failed to imagine what it was like to be simultaneously expecting a firstborn and mourning a mother."],["p","The photographs of Klara in the family archive—some of her alone, a few with her husband, Oskar, and most with her daughters, Hanna (my mother) and Jiřina, who was three years older—are consistently uninformative and flat. In a picture of her and the two girls that must have been taken around 1920, her characteristic rebuff of the camera’s overtures is underscored by the girls’ openness to them. Hanna, who would have been ten or eleven, is looking directly at the camera and positively flirting with it. Her mouth is a wide upturned crescent, her eyes merry slits; she is the picture of childhood ease and satisfaction. Jiřina responds differently to the camera’s attentions, but is no less complicit with its agenda. She is looking to the side, but in a way that reflects her awareness that she is being scrutinized. She is a beauty. She knows it and likes it but not all that much; there is a sadness in her that trumps her vanity and would remain her signature. When I knew her as an aunt, I felt her kindness, graciousness, reserve, and melancholy. Klara, who sits between the girls, with her arms around them, simply ignores the camera. She looks down at Hanna in a straightforward, unself-conscious way. She wears a discreet, well-made dress of the time. She looks like a generic mother figure in a child-rearing manual."],["p","In one respect, however, Klara was not generic at all. Evidently, she had a streak of avant-gardism in her. She had radical notions about how to furnish her bourgeois Prague home. Probably today’s eye would be struck more by the nineteenth-century character of the rooms than by their deviations from the Victorian norm. But Klara had picked up the idea of the “modern” and run with it. My mother would talk proudly of how “ahead” Klara was of her women friends (with whom she met weekly in a fashionable café to drink coffee with whipped cream and eat ",["em","Sacher Torte"],"), of her advanced taste, and of the interesting artifacts that she was always introducing into the household that were beyond her friends’ ability to “see” until Klara taught them how to. Unfortunately, there are no photographs of the apartment that my mother remembered with such fondness. The only relics from it are the white linen tablecloths and napkins and doilies that were in my mother’s trousseau, invoking not the social progress implicit in the new ",["em","Sachlichkeit"]," but, rather, the hideous labors of embroiderers and lace-makers that Adolf Loos condemned in his modernist manifesto “Ornament and Crime.” Most of the photographs of Klara and Oskar and their daughters were taken in studios. No glimpse exists of the delicious, remarkable Taussig apartment."],["p","I have inherited, or at any rate share, Klara’s interest in ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1970/08/08/about-the-house-5"},"interior design"],". As a child, I played with doll houses that were orange crates furnished with chairs and tables and beds contrived out of this and that piece of wood or metal or cloth scavenged from around the house. I feel a bond with the grandmother I never met over our preoccupation with this most inessential and ephemeral of forms. My handsome apartment will go the way of hers. There are photographs of it, but in their way they are as poker-faced as the photographs of Klara."],["p","The reader will have noticed that in the photograph of the mother and her daughters the girls are wearing what were called “Czech national costumes,” made up of white shirtwaists and dark bodices and lavishly decorated full skirts. Hanna wears a white embroidered mobcap over her long braids, and Jiřina has on a sort of dark turban that enhances her classical beauty. Marie and I wore such costumes in New York during the Second World War, when there were gatherings of Yorkville Czechs celebrating the Czechoslovak government-in-exile. Czechoslovakia, which came into being after the First World War, was carved out of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The secular Jewish Taussigs, like my secular Jewish parents, were part of the Czech nationalistic movement, identifying as Czechs rather than as Jews and taking pride in what was spoken of as the “model” democracy."],["p","Do you remember the noble Czech resistance leader played by Paul Henreid in “",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/casablanca"},"Casablanca"],"”? That this paragon was Czech rather than Polish or Hungarian or from any other Nazi-controlled country is a reflection of the high regard in which Czechoslovakia was held in the Allied world of 1942. Today, no one in his right mind can stand this self-satisfied sap or understand why Ingrid Bergman chooses him over Humphrey Bogart. It is to my credit and to my sister’s that we couldn’t stand most of the Czechs in our parents’ circle of émigrés."],["p","Only some of them were Jewish, but most of them, especially the men, possessed qualities that we found typically and odiously Czech, chief among them their humor. What might arguably have been funny in Prague was an embarrassment in New York. At least to us children. I cannot illustrate this, but I can still feel our icy contempt for the elaborate attempts of those idiots to be amusing. But note this: we did not feel critical of our parents. Their Czechness was O.K. Their humor—our family humor—was of the highest quality. All happy families are alike in the illusion of superiority that their children touchingly harbor. Later in life, I began to grasp the dangerous playfulness of Czech, the wit and charm it inspires in the light-fingered, and the boorishness it draws from the ham-fisted. The boorishness of some of my parents’ friends may have been innate—they might have been the same had they come from Cleveland rather than from Prague—but I associate it with a special Czech atmosphere."],["p","As for the inscrutable Klara, I have the feeling—although I have very little to go on—that she was preternaturally kind and good, and a little deficient in the humor department. Late in my mother’s life, she told me something about Klara that was like a turn of the kaleidoscope, changing an exquisite image into a less pretty one. She said that Klara, who had no means of her own, never received enough money from Oskar to maintain the household as she wanted to maintain it, and that this was a perpetual struggle between them. I immediately thought of Nora in “",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/03/10/the-marrying-kind"},"A Doll’s House"],",” abjectly cajoling her husband to give her money. I know even less about Oskar than about Klara. He was a lawyer, and my mother adored him, and she worked in his law firm after she got her law degree. I see some resemblance to myself in pictures of him. That’s all I can say about Oskar. If I had known I was going to write about him, I would have asked my mother questions. But now I am like a reporter with an empty notebook. Oskar is out of reach. Klara is slightly less so because of the accident of my mother’s nostalgia about her childhood home."],["inline-embed",{"type":"callout","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22callout%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22feature-small%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22image%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522image%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%2522%252Fphotos%252F5bca23fd8c9def5c3c6fbdd0%2522%252C%2522width%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522height%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522caption%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%225bca23fd8c9def5c3c6fbdd0%5C%22%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%22%2C%22attrs%22%3A%7B%7D%7D","ref":""},["inline-embed",{"type":"image","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22image%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22%2Fphotos%2F5bca23fd8c9def5c3c6fbdd0%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":"5bca23fd8c9def5c3c6fbdd0"}]],["p",["strong","IV.

picture of Klara and her daughters would have been taken seven or eight years earlier than the one in which the girls wear national costumes. It is a studio photograph, with the soft lighting and formal poses that are the genre’s signature. The three figures wear white dresses. Hanka—the name is the diminutive of Hanna—couldn’t be more than two or three, and once again draws the viewer’s charmed gaze. She has obeyed the photographer’s command to sit still, but she is doing something funny with her left hand. She is digging it into her mother’s thigh in a gesture that I immediately recognize and feel I have seen her perform as a grown woman, some sort of unconscious act of mushing or squishing. The Czech word ",["em","patlat"]," expresses it. ",["em","Upatlaný"],", applied to food, refers to dishes that have been over-meddled with. Someone has done to them what my mother is doing to her mother’s thigh. Jiřina already has the remote look of the later picture, although she has not yet grown into her beauty. Klara is the photograph’s still center."],["p","My mother idealized her sister. She spoke not only of her beauty but of her brains. She said that Jiřina was the one with real intellectual equipment, while she, Hanka, had none to speak of, didn’t know anything thoroughly or do anything properly, was some sort of fake. I’m not sure that I am ready to write about my mother, so I will write about the peripheral Eisner/Edwards family instead, as a sort of warmup exercise. Do we ever write about our parents without perpetrating a fraud? Doesn’t the lock on the bedroom door permanently protect them from our curiosity, keep us forever in the corridor of doubt?"],["p","This metaphor, which may be wrong in general, is particularly wrong for my parents, who did not share a bedroom. In Prague, like most upper-class and upper-middle-class couples, my parents had separate bedrooms. In New York, in their reduced living quarters, they had to create separate bedrooms out of parts of the apartment used for other purposes: my mother slept on a large studio couch in the living room, and my father slept on a regular studio couch in his study. When Marie and I learned about sex, we assumed that they did it on the large studio couch."],["p","Jiřina’s husband, Paul, was a lawyer and a businessman. He had been successful in Prague and was successful here. Soon after we moved to Manhattan, the Edwardses moved from Brooklyn to Forest Hills, to a brick house with a garden. We often drove out to visit them on weekends. It just occurred to me, as it didn’t when I was a child, that they never visited us. We were the poor relations. What could we offer them in our small apartment in a building on tenement-filled far-east Seventy-second Street? I later learned that there had been a struggle between my parents about the visits to Forest Hills. My father didn’t like the rich/poor setup. He didn’t like Paul. It’s not hard to see why. Paul was a vibrant, forceful man who liked to be the center of attention—he was a brilliant storyteller—and to hold children up in the air and tickle them. My mother passionately loved her sister and by extension loved her husband. I think my father was jealous of my mother’s mildly eroticized affection for Paul. But the visits were not happy for my mother, either. There were always a lot of people at the Edwards house—business associates of my uncle—and Jiřina, the dutiful hostess, was not available to her sister. I see her carrying trays from the house to the garden, and almost hear her nervous laugh."],["p","During one of the weekend visits to Forest Hills, Uncle Paul taught me how to wash my hands. He had caught me doing what children do, running a bit of water over my hands and then dirtying a towel with them. He instructed me on how to thoroughly soap both hands and rinse them and only then dry them. Another memory of my uncle comes from the dinner table at the house in Forest Hills. I noticed the deliberation with which he chewed his food, the assurance and self-confidence that the workings of his jaws seemed to express. And something else: at one of the meals there was a small bowl on the table, and I saw my uncle take a spoon and help himself to its entire contents. All of it! Was it a dish made expressly for him? Or was he brazenly flouting the rule that you should never take the last of anything?"],["p","We considered our family vastly superior to the Edwardses. They were in the world of money and business and we fancied ourselves in the world of literature and art. In fact, we were an ordinary middle-class, middlebrow family. My parents belonged to the Book-of-the-Month Club. My father wrote letters to the ",["em","Times"],", and one of them may have made it into print. After he died, we found in his papers copies of a letter from the nature writer Hal Borland, amiably acknowledging an error in his column that my father had found. In Prague, the claim to artiness had more substance. My parents were part of a circle of artists and intellectuals to which Karel Čapek belonged. My father published witty pieces in advanced periodicals. His wit was excellent—but it was Czech wit. He wrote perfectly well in English, but he could never be a real writer in the language. He had preposterous ambitions for his daughters. We would cringe when he talked about the “best-sellers” he expected us to write."],["p","I am writing this in a house in the country with the obligatory box of family letters in the attic that go unread year after year. Yesterday, I brushed the dust and dead flies off the box and began to read. Autobiography is a misnamed genre; memory speaks only some of its lines. Like biography, it enlists letters and the testimony of contemporaries in its novelistic enterprise. Combing through the box, I soon struck the gold of a letter that confirmed and amplified the portrait of Uncle Paul that I am drawing seventy years later. The letter, dated June 26, 1949, was written by my fifteen-year-old self to my parents, about a car trip I took with my uncle and aunt and cousin Eva to a village in Maine called Vassalboro. They had rented a house there for the summer and had invited me to join them. “We set out early with Eva driving. . . . For most of the trip I shocked the Edwards’ by telling them every dirty joke I knew,” I wrote in a mannered girl’s hand on light-blue stationery rimmed in dark blue:"],["blockquote",["p","Then Aunt Georgia [Jiřina’s American name: Jiři=George] started to tell a joke. Uncle Paul got very excited and said she would have to get out of the car if she told it. After much ado it was told and for 1/2 an hour we tried to get it. Finally we did and it wasn’t even funny."]],["p","Paul’s threat dovetails with my memory of his willful character. The sense of poor Georgia’s humiliation, the way Eva and I join the strong man against the weak woman (“it wasn’t even funny”), leaps out of the text. But what does it prove? I don’t know if my uncle was a domineering husband. I don’t know what the chronic exaggerated joking in the Edwards family meant about their deep relations. The gold is dross. The glitter of memory may be no less deceptive. The past is a country that issues no visas. We can only enter it illegally."],["inline-embed",{"type":"callout","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22callout%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22feature-small%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22image%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522image%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%2522%252Fphotos%252F5bca23fcdaf42d0501bd4258%2522%252C%2522width%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522height%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522caption%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%225bca23fcdaf42d0501bd4258%5C%22%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%22%2C%22attrs%22%3A%7B%7D%7D","ref":""},["inline-embed",{"type":"image","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22image%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22%2Fphotos%2F5bca23fcdaf42d0501bd4258%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":"5bca23fcdaf42d0501bd4258"}]],["p",["strong","V. Slečna"]]],["inline-embed",{"type":"section","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22section%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cp%3ESle%C4%8Dna%20Va%C5%88kov%C3%A1%20was%20an%20obese%20woman%20with%20short%2C%20straight%20hair%20and%20coarse%2C%20swarthy%20skin%20who%20always%20seemed%20to%20be%20sweating.%20She%20wore%20long%2C%20dark-red%20print%20dresses%2C%20all%20of%20which%20appeared%20to%20be%20the%20same%20dress%2C%20and%20heavy%20black%20shoes.%20She%20was%20the%20teacher%20of%20the%20after-school%20Czech%20school%20in%20Yorkville%20that%20Marie%20and%20I%20attended.%20Sle%C4%8Dna%20was%20not%20her%20first%20name%3B%20it%20is%20the%20Czech%20word%20for%20%E2%80%9CMiss.%E2%80%9D%20I%20don%E2%80%99t%20know%2C%20and%20never%20knew%2C%20her%20first%20name.%20She%20was%20simply%20Sle%C4%8Dna%20to%20the%20class%2C%20which%20met%20two%20afternoons%20a%20week%20in%20a%20building%20on%20East%20Seventy-third%20Street%20called%20N%C3%A1rodn%C3%AD%20Budova%2C%20or%20National%20Hall.%20The%20second-generation%20working-class%20Czechs%20in%20Yorkville%20sent%20their%20children%20to%20the%20school%20to%20learn%20to%20read%20and%20write%20the%20native%20language.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EWe%20did%20sort%20of%20learn%20to%20read%20and%20write%20Czech%2C%20but%20mostly%20we%20fooled%20around.%20The%20boys%20in%20the%20class%20plagued%20Sle%C4%8Dna%20with%20their%20wild%20disruptiveness.%20She%20was%20constantly%20yelling%20at%20them%20but%20was%20unable%20to%20control%20them.%20The%20girls%20disrupted%20the%20class%20in%20other%20ways.%20We%20whispered%20and%20passed%20notes.%20One%20day%2C%20a%20pair%20of%20twins%20named%20Janice%20and%20Rose%20brought%20in%20a%20pomegranate%20split%20in%20half%20and%20dispensed%20seeds%20to%20a%20favored%20few.%20I%20was%20not%20among%20them.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3ESle%C4%8Dna%20was%20not%20disliked.%20It%20was%20understood%20that%20she%20was%20kindhearted.%20But%20we%20were%20too%20young%20to%20be%20kind%20in%20return%20to%20someone%20so%20weak%20and%20(clinching%20our%20hard-heartedness)%20so%20unattractive.%20Today%2C%20I%20wonder%20about%20where%20and%20how%20she%20lived%2C%20what%20she%20did%20when%20she%20wasn%E2%80%99t%20teaching%20the%20class%2C%20how%20old%20she%20was.%20Back%20then%20she%20was%20just%20Sle%C4%8Dna.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3ETeaching%20reading%20and%20writing%20was%20not%20her%20main%20task.%20To%20raise%20money%20for%20the%20school%2C%20which%20was%20free%2C%20she%20was%20required%20to%20write%20and%20produce%20a%20play%20or%20a%20musical%20twice%20a%20year%20with%20a%20part%20in%20it%20for%20each%20of%20the%20students%2C%20of%20whom%20there%20were%20about%20twenty-five.%20The%20play%20was%20staged%20on%20the%20top%20floor%20of%20the%20building%2C%20where%20there%20was%20a%20proscenium%20stage%20and%20old-fashioned%20flats%20depicting%20forests%20and%20gardens%20and%20rustic%20interiors.%20One%20of%20Sle%C4%8Dna%E2%80%99s%20most%20memorable%20productions%20was%20a%20Czech%20version%20of%20%E2%80%9COklahoma!%E2%80%9D%20that%20has%20permanently%20left%20Czech%20lyrics%20to%20the%20music%20of%20Richard%20Rodgers%20in%20my%20ear.%20So%2C%20for%20a%20large%20part%20of%20each%20term%2C%20instead%20of%20learning%20to%20read%20and%20write%2C%20we%20endlessly%2C%20cluelessly%20rehearsed%2C%20first%20in%20the%20classroom%20and%20then%20upstairs%20on%20the%20stage.%20A%20thin%2C%20affrighted%20woman%20named%20Sle%C4%8Dna%20Kop%C5%99ivov%C3%A1%20played%20the%20piano%20for%20the%20musical%20numbers.%20At%20the%20far%20end%20of%20the%20room%2C%20opposite%20the%20stage%2C%20was%20a%20bar%20where%20there%20were%20always%20men%20drinking.%20The%20place%20smelled%20of%20beer%20and%20of%20a%20kind%20of%20evocative%20staleness%20perhaps%20inherent%20in%20nineteenth-century%20New%20York%20buildings.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3ESites%20of%20idleness%20and%20wasted%20time%20like%20the%20Czech%20school%20are%20fertile%20breeding%20grounds%20for%20the%20habit%20many%20of%20us%20form%20in%20childhood%20of%20always%20being%20in%20love%20with%20somebody.%20Eros%20was%20in%20the%20air%20in%20Sle%C4%8Dna%E2%80%99s%20unruly%20classroom.%20I%20had%20a%20crush%20on%20a%20boy%20named%20Zden%C4%9Bk%2C%20and%20experienced%20my%20first%20taste%20of%20sexual%

Vaňková was an obese woman with short, straight hair and coarse, swarthy skin who always seemed to be sweating.

Slečna was not her first name; it is the Czech word for “Miss.” I don’t know, and never knew, her first name. She was simply Slečna to the class, which met two afternoons a week in a building on East Seventy-third Street called Národní Budova, or National Hall.

The boys in the class plagued Slečna with their wild disruptiveness. She was constantly yelling at them but was unable to control them. The girls disrupted the class in other ways.

I was not among them."],["p","Slečna was not disliked. It was understood that she was kindhearted. But we were too young to be kind in return to someone so weak and (clinching our hard-heartedness) so unattractive. Today, I wonder about where and how she lived, what she did when she wasn’t teaching the class, how old she was. Back then she was just Slečna."],["p","Teaching reading and writing was not her main task. To raise money for the school, which was free, she was required to write and produce a play or a musical twice a year with a part in it for each of the students, of whom there were about twenty-five. The play was staged on the top floor of the building, where there was a proscenium stage and old-fashioned flats depicting forests and gardens and rustic interiors. One of Slečna’s most memorable productions was a Czech version of “Oklahoma!” that has permanently left Czech lyrics to the music of Richard Rodgers in my ear. So, for a large part of each term, instead of learning to read and write, we endlessly, cluelessly rehearsed, first in the classroom and then upstairs on the stage. A thin, affrighted woman named Slečna Kopřivová played the piano for the musical numbers. At the far end of the room, opposite the stage, was a bar where there were always men drinking. The place smelled of beer and of a kind of evocative staleness perhaps inherent in nineteenth-century New York buildings."],["p","Sites of idleness and wasted time like the Czech school are fertile breeding grounds for the habit many of us form in childhood of always being in love with somebody. Eros was in the air in Slečna’s unruly classroom. I had a crush on a boy named Zdeněk, and experienced my first taste of sexual jealousy. The object of that lowering emotion was a girl named Anna, or Anči. The boys were always showing off for her. She had all the mythic attributes of desirability: she was beautiful, vivid, self-contained. I envied everything about her, not least her bluejeans, which were faded and soft, unlike my own immutably dark, stiff ones; in those days, you couldn’t buy pre-faded jeans, you had to earn the light-blue color and the softness. Anči probably inherited her jeans from a brother or sister, but at the time their desirable fadedness seemed like another of her magical attributes. I was part of the background of ordinary girls who secretly loved and, unbeknownst to ourselves, were grateful for the safety of not being loved in return. The pleasure and the terror of that would come later."],["p","About twenty years ago, I unexpectedly received a package in the mail containing ten or twelve black-and-white photographs. The return address was the ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/library-of-congress"},"Library of Congress"],", and the sender was a library employee who had somehow connected me to the family that appeared in the photographs, and had thought that I might like to have them. I certainly did. The family was my family. The pictures were not snapshots—they were glossy eight-by-ten prints that had a professional, you could even say slick, character, the sort of photographs that appeared in ",["em",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/04/19/untimely-jill-lepore"},"Life"]]," and constituted a kind of picture story of harmless everyday existence. They showed us around the dinner table at home, in Central Park—Marie and I roller-skating around the lake and eating popsicles at Bethesda Fountain—and in class at public school, and at Czech school (thus the picture of Slečna and me at the blackboard). They were taken in 1942, by a photographer named Marjory Collins, who worked for the Office of War Information in Washington. Her boss was Roy Stryker, who, as the head of the photography unit of the Farm Security Administration, had famously elicited—from Dorothea Lange, Walker Evans, Russell Lee, and Carl Mydans, among others—the ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/photo-booth/photographing-the-great-recession-looking-back-to-the-great-depression"},"images of rural poverty"]," that gave the Depression its unmistakable face. After we entered the Second World War, Stryker’s unit was moved from the F.S.A. to the O.W.I. and given a new mandate. Now America was to be represented as the locus of the struggle of ordinary, decent people against the German and Japanese threats. Pictures of young women on assembly lines making airplane parts and of retired couples tending victory gardens were among the new indelible images. Marjory Collins’s photographs of our family belonged to a special subsection of the general propagandistic project. According to a short biography of Collins written by Beverly W. Brannan, a curator of photography at the Library of Congress, the photographs of “ ‘hyphenated Americans,’ including Chinese-, Czech-, German-, Irish-, Italian-, Jewish-, and Turkish-Americans . . . were used to illustrate publications dropped behind enemy lines to reassure people in Axis-power countries that the United States was sympathetic to their needs.” I love the thought that pictures of Marie and me eating popsicles at Bethesda Fountain were dropped behind enemy lines. I love the phrase “behind enemy lines.” I have no memory of the sessions with Marjory Collins. She must have spent several days with us. The photograph of us at dinner shows an empty place at the table where she must have sat after taking her pictures. The images reflect a charming and likable person who made us all seem charming and likable, if a little boring. I suspect that the exciting, Arbus-like picture of the grotesque Slečna was one that she would have preferred not to have

when something displeased my father, an ugly expression would appear on his face. The expression disappeared in a moment and was related to nothing about him. He was the gentlest of men. He never punished us (it was my mother who occasionally spanked us) and we never knew him to be unkind to anyone. But the ugly expression—as though he were flinching from a horror—did appear and was all the more striking because of its incongruity with his usual mild demeanor."],["p","Parents have their mythologies. The myth of my father was that at the age of ten he had left his home in a small Czech village called Poděbrady and gone to Prague to study at the ",["em","gymnasium"],", supporting himself by tutoring less clever students. It wasn’t until after his death and late in my mother’s life that it occurred to me to question her about this remarkable story. How was a ten-year-old boy able to live alone in a big city? Where had he lived? Was he really completely on his own? Well, no, it turned out. He had lived with relatives. The tutoring contributed to, but did not constitute, his upkeep. The story remained obscure—I never learned who the relatives were—but was no longer improbable."],["p","Another part of my father’s mythology was his reputation as a man-about-town in the years before his marriage to my mother. He married late—at thirty-two—as men did in those days; ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/08/28/why-freud-survives"},"Freud"],", for example, married after a long engagement to Martha, when he could finally afford the furniture, silver, and porcelain for their apartment in Vienna. By the time I knew my father, he was a bald, slightly flabby, middle-aged doctor on whom a history of girl-chasing had left no visible trace. But the legend of his rakishness persisted, so that Marie and I could (not altogether seriously) speculate about romantic liaisons between him and women friends of the family. He sometimes said of himself that he had better relations with women than with men, but this was not to boast about his relations with women so much as to express regret about his relations with men. He had grown up without a father and believed this was at the root of his inability to form strong male friendships. His mother and father had divorced soon after he was born. Details about his father, Moritz Wiener, are elusive, almost nonexistent. My father and his older sister, Maria, grew up in the household of their maternal grandmother, Jennie Růžičková, who had had thirteen children and ran a sewing business in Poděbrady. The Růžičkas were practicing Jews, but Růžička is not a Jewish name. My father told us that an ancestor bought it from a state official. This may be another myth. We know that, in the eighteenth century, laws were passed requiring Eastern European Jews to adopt non-Jewish names; but no record exists of the sale of these names or of price lists set according to their pleasingness. However, the legend of the store-bought name persists and retains its innocent allure. I find it nice to think that the storied ancestor who bought Růžička—which means “little rose” in Czech—was not cheap about his momentous purchase."],["p","I imagined my father’s life in the village as something out of late Tolstoy: a peasant culture of want, harshness, and discomfort; sledges chased by wolves through the snow, not enough to eat, everything scratchy and uncouth, nothing easy, nothing pretty. Some of this idea of my father as a sort of liberated serf must have come from my mother. She didn’t exactly put on airs, but we picked up on her feeling of superiority, not to my father himself—whose virtues of mind and character were not lost on her—but to his unfortunate roots, his late exposure to Taussig ease and elegance."],["p","Sometimes I noticed a special pleasure, almost a rapture, in him when he came out of the cold into a warm house or when he ate something that he liked, and I linked this to the days of deprivation. I felt it to be some sort of reflexive memory of relief from discomfort and want. I’m inclined to think that this is an example of my sensing something real rather than imagining things."],["p","Another myth about my father was his skill as a diagnostician. Although he worked as both a psychiatrist and a neurologist, his feats of almost uncannily correct diagnosis were in the latter field. I own a magnificent huge pen-and-ink drawing by the modernist sculptor Bernard Reder depicting the Stations of the Cross, which he gave my father in gratitude for ridding him of an affliction of the right hand which prevented him from working. He had gone from doctor to doctor. My father swiftly diagnosed the condition and cured it with a simple home remedy. When a medical journal later published an article of my father’s, “Chronic Progressive Chorea Masquerading as Functional Disorder,” we were confirmed in our sense of his exalted standing in a rarefied field. We were less awed by his work as a psychiatrist. This was the so-called heyday of Freudian theory in America. Psychiatrists were psychoanalysts manqué; they talked the same fancy language. They treated sicker patients, depressives and psychotics, but believed that the talking cure, designed for neurotics, could help them. The mystery of madness hangs over the world like a cry at night. The children of psychiatrists are no less crassly derisive about crazy people than the rest of the sane world. We would make dumb jokes about the nuts Daddy treated and about loony bins and laughing academies. My father good-naturedly accepted our cruel, stupid talk. He was always sympathetic to fun. There is a particularly wonderful expression in the invented émigré genre of mixed-up Czech and English: ",["em","lotofánek"],", i.e., a lot of fun, set in the diminutive form that Czech nouns helplessly gravitate toward. Daddy had no side. He may be the least pretentious person I have ever known, he never pulled rank on anyone, he had no fear of losing face."],["p","He loved opera, birds, mushrooms, wildflowers, poetry, baseball. I am flooded with things I want to say about him. He left more traces of his existence than most people do, because he was always writing things down, on little cards, on onionskin paper (his poems), in diaries, even on the walls of the cabin on a lake where he and my mother spent weekends and summer holidays. My mind is filled with lovely plotless memories of him. The memories with a plot are, of course, the ones that commit the original sin of autobiography and give it its vitality if not its raison d’être. They are the memories of conflict, resentment, blame, self-justification—and it is wrong, unfair, inexcusable to publish them. “Who asked you to tarnish my image with your miserable little hurts?” the dead person might reasonably ask. Since my father was not concerned with his image, he would probably not object to the recitation of my wounded child’s grievances. But I do not wish to make it. He was a wonderful father. I know he dearly loved me and my sister. But he loved his own life more and seemed to have hated leaving it more than most men and women do."],["p","We are each of us an endangered species. When we die, our species disappears with us. Nobody like us will ever exist again. The lives of great artists and thinkers and statesmen are like the lives of the great extinct species, the tyrannosaurs and stegosaurs, while the lives of the obscure can be likened to extinct species of beetles. Daddy would probably not find this conceit of great interest. He moved along his own trail. He liked to pick and identify certain small, frail, white wildflowers that it never occurred to me to notice, and that he never forced on my attention. ♦"]]],"canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"sections":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"},"slug":"magazine","children":[{"id":"59111e90df652b705f4ab89d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"59111e90df652b705f4ab89d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Personal History","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"personal-history"},{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"},{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"}],"name":"Personal History","parent":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"},"slug":"personal-history"}]}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"magazine","contentTags":[],"contentType":"article","contributors":[{"name":"Janet Malcolm","type":"author","title":"Janet Malcolm has been writing for \u003cem&gt;The New Yorker\u003c/em&gt; since 1963, when the magazine published her poem “Thoughts on Living in a Shaker House.”","email":"","bio":["div",["p","Janet Malcolm has been writing for ",["em","The New Yorker"]," since 1963, when the magazine published her poem “Thoughts on Living in a Shaker House.”"],["p","For nearly ten years, Malcolm wrote About the House, a column on interiors and design.

Debussy died a century ago, but his music has not grown old. Bound only lightly to the past, it floats in time. As it coalesces, bar by bar, it appears to be improvising itself into being—which is the effect Debussy wanted. After a rehearsal of his orchestral suite “Images,” he said, with satisfaction, “This has the air of not having been written down.” In a conversation with one of his former teachers, he declared, “There is no theory. You merely have to listen. Pleasure is the law.”"],["p","To mark the centenary of Debussy’s death, which fell in March, two handsome boxed sets of his complete works have been issued. They befit a man who treasured pretty things. One, from the Deutsche Grammophon label, is decorated with Jacques-Émile Blanche’s portrait of the composer, in which he assumes an aristocratic, lapel-grasping pose. The other, from Warner Classics, displays Hokusai’s woodblock print “The Great Wave Off Kanagawa,” which, at Debussy’s request, was reproduced on the cover of one of his most celebrated scores, “La Mer.” Physical recordings are no longer a fashionable way of listening to music, but you will probably get closer to Debussy if you shut down the Internet and give yourself wholly to his world. The D.G. set has the libretto of his only finished opera, “Pelléas et Mélisande,” and the texts of his large output of songs—necessary resources in approaching an acutely literary composer whom ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/04/11/stephane-mallarme-prophet-of-modernism"},"Stéphane Mallarmé"]," and Marcel Proust recognized as an equal."],["p","It is best to start where Pierre Boulez said modern music was born: with the ethereal first notes of the orchestral tone poem “",["a",{"href":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlLoXvamfZw&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=22"},"Prelude to ‘The Afternoon of a Faun.’ "],"” Debussy wrote it between 1892 and 1894, in response to the famous poem by Mallarmé. The score begins with what looks like an uncertain doodle on the part of the composer. A solo flute slithers down from C-sharp to G-natural, then slithers back up; the same figure recurs; then there is a songful turn around the notes of the E-major triad. Yet, in the fourth bar, when more instruments enter—two oboes, two clarinets, a horn, and a rippling harp—they ignore the flute’s offering of E. Instead, they recline into a lovely chord of nowhere, a half-diminished seventh of the type that ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/richard-wagner"},"Wagner"]," placed at the outset of “Tristan und Isolde.” This leads to a lush dominant seventh on B-flat, which ought to resolve to F, but doesn’t. Harmonies distant from one another intermingle in an open space. Most striking is the presence of silence. The B-flat harmonies are framed by bar-long voids. This is sound in repose, listening to its own echo."],["p","Debussy accomplished something that happens very rarely, and not in every lifetime: he brought a new kind of beauty into the world. In 1894, when “Faun” was first performed, its language was startling but not shocking: it caused no scandal, and was accepted by the public almost at once. Debussy engineered a velvet revolution, overturning the extant order without upheaval. His influence proved to be vast, not only for successive waves of twentieth-century modernists but also in jazz, in popular song, and in Hollywood. When both the severe Boulez and the suave ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/duke-ellington"},"Duke Ellington"]," cite you as a precursor, you have done something singular."],["p","The music is easy to love but hard to explain. The shelf of books about Debussy is not large, and every scholar who addresses him faces the challenge of analyzing an artist to whom analysis was abhorrent. The latest addition to that shelf is Stephen Walsh’s “",["a",{"href":"https://www.amazon.com/Debussy-Painter-Sound-Stephen-Walsh/dp/1524731927"},"Debussy: A Painter in Sound"],"” (Knopf), which places proper emphasis on Debussy’s myriad links to other art forms. The composer may have been the first in history to become a fully modern-minded artist, joining a community of writers and painters, borrowing ideas and lending them in turn. Admittedly, before Debussy there was Wagner, whose impact was sufficiently seismic that the term “Wagnerism” had to be coined to describe it. With Wagner, though, the influence tended to go in one direction: outward. Debussy was receptive. He saw, he read, he pondered, and he transformed the ineffable into

was a very, very strange man,” the soprano Mary Garden said. With his piercing eyes and jutting forehead, he could make a rough first impression—like “a proud Calabrian bandit,” according to the pianist Ricardo Viñes. François Lesure, the author of the definitive ",["a",{"href":"https://www.amazon.com/Debusy-F-Lesure/dp/2213616191"},"French-language biography"]," of Debussy, portrays him as “withdrawn, unsociable, taciturn, skittish, susceptible, distant, shy.” He was said to be “catlike and solitary.” He “lived in a kind of haughty misanthropy, behind a rampart of irony.” He had a tendency toward mendacity in his professional and personal relationships. He was conscious enough of his limitations: “Those around me persist in not understanding that I have never been able to live in a real world of people and things.”"],["p","Debussy was born in the Paris suburbs in 1862, to an impoverished family. His father, Manuel, held a string of jobs, including china-shop owner, travelling salesman, and print worker. His mother, Victorine, was a seamstress. In the period of the Paris Commune, in 1871, Manuel served in the revolutionary forces, as a captain, and when the Commune was defeated he spent more than a year in prison. Fortuitously, when Manuel told Charles de Sivry, another inmate, about his son’s musical interests, Sivry mentioned that his mother, Antoinette Mauté, was a pianist. Mauté, a well-connected woman who was said to have studied with Chopin, began teaching the boy, and helped to arrange his admission to the Paris Conservatory, in 1872. Another notable thing about Mauté is that her daughter Mathilde had the misfortune of being married to Paul Verlaine. At the time, that ill-fated couple was living with Mauté, and Arthur Rimbaud, soon to become Verlaine’s lover, was an increasing source of tension. Although Debussy never spoke of meeting either Verlaine or Rimbaud, he must have been at least vaguely aware of the chaos in the household."],["inline-embed",{"type":"callout","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22callout%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22inset-left%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22cartoon%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522cartoon%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%2522%252Fcartoon%252F5bc8bac31351512d3203ae59%2522%252C%2522width%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522height%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522caption%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%225bc8bac31351512d3203ae59%5C%22%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%22%2C%22attrs%22%3A%7B%7D%7D","ref":""},["inline-embed",{"type":"cartoon","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22cartoon%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22%2Fcartoon%2F5bc8bac31351512d3203ae59%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":"5bc8bac31351512d3203ae59"}]],["p","At the conservatory, Debussy was a restless student, exasperating his teachers and fascinating his schoolmates. When confronted with the fundamentals of harmony and form, he asked why any systems were needed. He had little trouble mastering academic exercises, and, after two attempts, he won the Prix de Rome, a traditional stepping stone to a successful compositional career. But in his early vocal pieces, and in his legendarily mesmerizing improvisations at the piano, he jettisoned rules that had been in place for hundreds of years. Familiar chords appeared in unfamiliar sequences. Melodies followed the contours of ancient or exotic scales. Forms dissolved into textures and moods. An academic evaluation accused him of indulging in Impressionism—a label that stuck."],["p","Perhaps Debussy’s central insight was about the constricting effect of the standard major and minor scales. Why not use the old modes of medieval church music? Or the differently arrayed and tuned scales found in non-Western traditions? Or the whole-tone scale, which divided the octave into equal intervals? Debussy had a particular fondness for the ",["a",{"href":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf0mZ42Kf7w"},"natural harmonic series"],"—the spectrum of overtones that arise from a vibrating string. If you pinch a taut string in the middle, its pitch goes up an octave. If you pinch it at successively smaller fractions, the basic intervals of conventional Western harmony emerge. So far, so good: but what about the notes further out in the series? These are more difficult to assimilate. In the chain of intervals derived from a C, you encounter a tone somewhere near B-flat and another in the vicinity of F-sharp. Debussy favored a mode that has become known as the acoustic scale, which mimics the overtone series by raising the fourth degree (F-sharp) and lowering the seventh (B-flat). That those notes correspond to blue notes helps to explain Debussy’s appeal to jazz musicians."],["p","Debussy had the prejudices typical of his time, and never thought too deeply about the cultures that he sampled. Nevertheless, he knew to look outside the classical sphere for nourishment. At the Paris Exposition of 1889, he heard a gamelan ensemble, which made Western harmonies sound to him like “empty phantoms of use to clever little children.” Those first measures of “Afternoon of a

rejection of the musical status quo was fuelled by his jealous love of poetry and painting. The most revelatory experience I’ve had with the composer in recent years was not in the concert hall but in a museum: an exhibition entitled “Debussy, Music, and the Arts,” which was mounted at the Musée de l’Orangerie, in Paris, in 2012. To turn from the manuscript of “Faun” to a copy of Mallarmé’s poem, and then to see on the walls a Whistler seascape and Hokusai’s “Great Wave,” was to feel Debussy’s synesthetic kick. For him, music had fallen behind: it had nothing that rivalled free verse in poetry, the drift toward abstraction in painting, and the investigation of mystical spheres that was happening across the arts."],["p","Poetry spurred Debussy’s earliest breakthroughs. His individual voice materializes in settings of Paul Bourget, Théodore de Banville, Baudelaire, Verlaine, and Mallarmé—poets who ranged from Parnassian classicism to Symbolist esotericism. Like a hunter chasing an elusive quarry, Debussy repeatedly tried to capture the eerie stillness of Verlaine’s “En Sourdine”: “Calm in the half-light / Made by the tall branches, / Let our love be imbued / With deep silence.” As Walsh observes, Debussy’s ",["a",{"href":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pGUF0dvTXk"},"first attempts"],", from 1882, are thick with Wagnerian harmony. A ",["a",{"href":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPimTUtEFAI"},"version from a decade later"]," is spare and piercing, all excess expunged. Debussy is ready to compose “Afternoon of a Faun,” which arose when Mallarmé asked him to contribute to a theatrical version of his poem. (No production resulted.) “Inert, all burns in this savage hour,” the poem reads, making oblique mention of “him who searches for the la”—the note A. This is the atmosphere of Debussy’s opening, with its charged stasis and its chords of resonance."],["p","The visual arts proved an equally important fund of inspiration, although the Impressionist label has perpetuated the erroneous notion that Debussy tried to do in music what Monet, Renoir, and Degas did in painting. Those artists were in his field of vision, but the rush of brushwork that defines Impressionist painting—the erasure of the clean line in pursuit of a hazier reality—is alien to Debussy’s crystalline technique. Elusive but never vague, he is closer in spirit to the Symbolist movement, with its vivid evocations of unreal realms, and to the fable-bright world of Les Nabis. He also looked to the Pre-Raphaelites—“La Damoiselle Élue,” a pivotal early cantata, is based on Dante Gabriel Rossetti’s poem “The Blessed Damozel”—and to the semi-abstract seascapes of J. M. W. Turner, which forecast the tumult of “La Mer.”"],["p","The culmination of this first phase of Debussy’s revolution is “Pelléas et Mélisande,” an opera so unlike its predecessors that it effectively inaugurated a new genre of modernist music theatre. A tale of two half-brothers who fall in love with the same mysterious maiden, it is based on the eponymous play by the Belgian Symbolist Maurice Maeterlinck, who had a fin-de-siècle vogue before largely falling out of sight. Maeterlinck is worth revisiting—his elliptical dialogue looks ahead to the work of Samuel Beckett. Debussy, facing the gnomic text of “Pelléas,” made the radical decision to set it line by line, without recourse to a versifying librettist. This had been done before, notably in Russian opera, but Debussy achieved an unprecedented merger of music with an advanced literary aesthetic. In the wake of “Pelléas” came Strauss’s “Salome” and “Elektra,” Berg’s “Wozzeck” and “Lulu,” and Bernd Alois Zimmermann’s “Die Soldaten.”"],["p","“Pelléas” engenders its own world on the ",["a",{"href":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lc7h0BLCBQk&amp;start_radio=1&amp;list=RDlc7h0BLCBQk"},"first page of the score"],". In an essay in the new scholarly anthology “",["a",{"href":"https://www.amazon.com/Debussys-Resonance-Eastman-Studies-Music/dp/1580465250/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1540220154&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Debussy%E2%80%99s+Resonance"},"Debussy’s Resonance"],"” (University of Rochester Press), Katherine Bergeron indicates how this happens. In the first four bars, bassoons, cellos, and double basses make a stark, columnar sound that conjures the forest in which the drama begins. It is, Bergeron writes, an evocation of “dim antiquity, carving out a fragment of plainsong in stolid half notes.” She continues, “The figure suggests an immense murmur, or an ancient cosmic sigh, whose sheer weight draws it to the bottom of the orchestra. Then it vanishes. A different music takes its place, sounding high in the winds, its bass voice a tritone away. With its more articulate rhythm and brighter timbre, the melody sounds a sort of anxious trill: indecisive, edgy, almost dissonant.” This second motif is associated with Golaud, who ends up killing his half-brother, Pelléas. Golaud, Bergeron observes, seems strikingly disconnected from the forest around him. We hear not only two distinct textures but the gap between them. This defining gesture is painterly at heart: a single stroke of the brush turns the remainder of the canvas into resonant

première of “Pelléas,” in 1902, established Debussy as the dominant French composer of his time. He became a trend, a “school”: critics spoke of “Debussystes” and “Debussysme.” For a man accustomed to thinking of himself as a loner, the fame was disconcerting. His life was further complicated by personal chaos, largely of his own making. His first marriage, to the fashion model Lilly Texier, fell apart when he began an affair with the singer Emma Bardac. In 1904, Texier attempted suicide; the affair became public, and Debussy lost many friends. He subsequently married Bardac. That relationship, too, was troubled, although it lasted until his death. “An artist is, all in all, a detestable, inward-facing man,” Debussy wrote to Texier in 1904, as if brutal candor somehow excused his behavior."],["p","In this period, Debussy took up a second career, as a music critic, delivering a stream of prickly, contrarian opinions that seemed almost designed to increase his isolation. Beethoven wrote badly for the piano, he proclaimed: “With a few exceptions, his works should have been allowed to rest.” Wagner was a literary genius but no musician. Gluck was pompous and artificial. There was a method to this crankiness: Debussy was attacking the tendency to worship the past at the expense of the present. In a later interview, he said that he actually admired Beethoven and Wagner, but refused to “admire them uncritically, just because people have told me that they are masters.”"],["p","Debussy struggled to come up with a successor to “Pelléas.” His list of contemplated operas included a setting of Pierre Louÿs’s “",["a",{"href":"https://www.amazon.com/Aphrodite-French-Pierre-Lou%C3%BFs/dp/1720850801/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1540220279&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Aphrodite+pierre"},"Aphrodite"],"”; an adaptation of Shakespeare’s “",["a",{"href":"https://www.amazon.com/You-Like-Folger-Shakespeare-Library/dp/074348486X/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1540220242&amp;sr=1-3&amp;keywords=As+You+Like+It"},"As You Like It"],"”; and works on topics as various as Siddhartha, Orpheus, the Oresteia, Don Juan, Romeo and Juliet, and Tristan and Yseult (“a subject which has not as yet been treated,” Debussy said, impishly). Not all these ideas were serious; Debussy had a bad habit of seeking advances for projects that he had little intention of completing. He did, however, expend considerable energy on a pair of operas inspired by Edgar Allan Poe: a comedy, based on “",["a",{"href":"https://www.amazon.com/Devil-Belfry-Edgar-Allan-Poe-ebook/dp/B07H63QM1W/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1540220306&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=The+Devil+in+the+Belfry"},"The Devil in the Belfry"],",” and a tragedy, based on “",["a",{"href":"https://www.amazon.com/Fall-House-Usher-Edgar-Allan/dp/1981021396/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1540220322&amp;sr=1-1-spons&amp;keywords=The+Fall+of+the+House+of+Usher&amp;psc=1"},"The Fall of the House of Usher."],"” Enough sketches for the latter exist that the scholar Robert Orledge has been able to make a stylish and often convincing reconstruction, which the Pan Classics label recorded in 2016, alongside a less persuasive version of the “Belfry” material."],["p","If Debussy’s operatic path remained largely blocked, he found new fluency in the production of instrumental scores: the three sets of “Images” for piano and for orchestra, the two books of Preludes for solo piano, “La Mer,” and the dance score “Jeux.” In this pervasively dazzling body of music, Symbolist gloom gives way to glowing new colors and a fresh rhythmic punch. Popular influences come to the fore: vaudeville tunes, circus marches, cabaret, Iberian dances, ragtime."],["p","While exploring the D.G. Debussy box, the richer of the two collections, I found myself fixated on Arturo Benedetti Michelangeli’s casually immaculate rendering of “",["a",{"href":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCkM2a4daZU"},"Reflets dans l’Eau,"],"” from the first book of “Images.” Michelangeli’s recording of “Images,” made in 1971, is rightly regarded as one of the greatest piano records ever made. “Reflets” begins with eight bars confined to the key of D-flat major, or, more precisely, to the scale associated with that key. Chords drawn from those seven notes lounge indolently across the keyboard. In the ninth bar, though, the work goes gorgeously haywire. Extraneous notes invade the inner voices, even as a D-flattish upper line is maintained. Pinprick dissonances disrupt the sense of a tonal center, and the music collapses into harmonic limbo, in the form of a rolled chord of fourths. This is Debussyan atonality, which predates Schoenberg’s and is very different in spirit: not a lunge into the unknown but a walk on the wild side. We stroll back home with a descending string of chords that defy brief description: sevenths of various kinds, diminished sevenths, dominant sevenths, and what, in jazz, is called the minor major seventh. Michelangeli, who admired the jazz pianist Bill Evans and was admired by Evans in turn, plays this whole stretch of music as if he were hunched over a piano in a smoke-filled club, at one in the morning, sometime during the Eisenhower Administration.

As in “Afternoon of a Faun,” an idea remains largely fixed while the context around it undergoes kaleidoscopic changes. First the theme sounds in the winds, over rapidly pulsing lower strings; then it hovers in an ambience of luminous calm; then it takes on an impassioned, quasi-Romantic character in the violins."],["p","The ",["a",{"href":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITDteHEyJHw&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=386"},"fourth iteration"]," never fails to make me want to leap from my chair. The downward-sighing theme is back in the winds, but it floats above a multilayered texture in which rhythms and accents are landing every which way: scurrying triplets in the strings, horns sounding on the fourth beat of the bar, piercing grace notes in the piccolo, and a curious oompah section comprised of timpani, cymbals, and bass drum. Most of the instruments are dancing to the side of the beat. The net result of all this layering is an irresistible sense of buoyancy. Particularly striking is a galloping pattern in the strings—four rapid hoofbeats endlessly recurring. Debussy liked the work of the British painter and illustrator Walter Crane, and I wonder whether “La Mer” might have something to do with Crane’s 1892 painting “Neptune’s Horses,” in which phantom beasts materialize from a cresting wave."],["p","The D.G. box includes two performances of “La Mer”: one with the Santa Cecilia Orchestra, under Leonard Bernstein, and one with the Berlin Philharmonic, under Herbert von Karajan. Both make an impressive noise at the climaxes, although they fall prey to an aggrandizing tendency noted by the scholar Simon Trezise, in a book-length study of “La Mer.” Since Toscanini, Trezise argues, conductors have made “La Mer” an “orchestral showpiece of the first order,” rather than a complexly layered conception in which foreground and background merge. Trezise rightly draws attention to pioneering recordings by the Italian conductor Piero Coppola, in which the strings are restrained in favor of pungent winds. That leanness and a vibrancy of color reëmerge in a 2012 rendition of “La Mer” by Jos van Immerseel and the ensemble Anima Eterna Brugge, which uses instruments from Debussy’s era."],["p","Still, I cherish most the various recordings made by Boulez, who dedicated himself to banishing all sentimental mists from Debussy’s music, thereby exposing its modernity. Regrettably, Boulez’s 1995 reading with the Cleveland Orchestra is missing from the D.G. box, but the set does include his staggeringly precise account of “Jeux.” In the finale of “La Mer,” Boulez’s meticulous attention to rhythmic subtleties redoubles the music’s kinetic energy. When he ",["a",{"href":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mGqLaD_zaU&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1386"},"led the New York Philharmonic"]," in “La Mer” in 1992—his final appearance with that ensemble—the

1913, Debussy arrived at the inevitable moment when he no longer occupied the vanguard. That year, the Ballets Russes unleashed ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/igor-stravinsky"},"Stravinsky’s"]," “Rite of Spring.” Debussy marvelled at Stravinsky’s invention, but felt uneasy about his younger colleague’s ruthless brilliance. “Primitive music with all modern conveniences” was his wry comment on the “Rite.” The advent of full-on atonality in the music of Schoenberg and his pupils left Debussy cold. He loved the strange but not the harsh."],["p","As Europe devolved into barbarism in the early years of the First World War, Debussy adopted a decorous, formally controlled style that looked back to the aristocratic poise of the French Baroque. With this unexpected swerve, he was following the advice he gave to his stepson, to “distrust the path that your ideas make you take.” As Walsh points out, Debussy’s self-distrust considerably slowed his productivity, as he tested “every chord and chord sequence, every rhythm, every colour for their precise effect.”"],["p","In the summer of 1915, Debussy embarked on a cycle of six sonatas for different groups of instruments—a telling gesture, since up to this point he had largely ignored the received forms of classical tradition. In a burst of creativity, he completed two of them in a matter of weeks: the Cello Sonata and the ",["a",{"href":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojR_UiWKkfw"},"Sonata for Flute, Viola, and Harp"],". A Violin Sonata followed. He considered these works a “secret homage” to French soldiers fallen in battle. In a patriotic mood, he signed them “Claude Debussy, French musician.” They forecast the West’s turn toward neoclassicism in the postwar period, not least in Stravinsky’s ever-evolving, fashion-setting œuvre. Yet Debussy avoided intellectual irony or self-consciousness. He saw himself as restoring the beauty that had been destroyed in the war."],["p","The Harmonia Mundi label has added to the welcome flood of Debussy on disk with its own Centenary Edition, and one of its finest offerings is a survey of those three sonatas. Isabelle Faust and Alexander Melnikov play the Violin Sonata; Jean-Guihen Queyras and Javier Perianes undertake the Cello Sonata; and the flutist Magali Mosnier, the violist Antoine Tamestit, and the harpist Xavier de Maistre give a pristine performance of the sonata dedicated to their instruments. That piece is sometimes so sparing in its application of notes to the page that it hardly seems to exist. The score contains such indications as “dying away” and “as delicately as possible.” This is music suffused with pale light; each terse, tender phrase seems aware of its own impermanence."],["p","Debussy had found a new path—beyond Symbolism, beyond modernism. One can only wonder what might have followed, for his life came to a grim end. In 1915, he was given a diagnosis of rectal cancer and underwent an operation that had limited success. His final years were horrible. He suffered from incontinence and stopped leaving the house. He died as German forces were shelling Paris. Afterward, his twelve-year-old daughter, called Chouchou, wrote a heartbreaking letter to her half-brother: “I saw him again one last time in that horrible box—He looked happy, oh so happy.” Chouchou died the following year, of diphtheria—a fate of which Debussy, blessedly, had no inkling.

centerpiece of the artist and musician Lonnie Holley’s new album, “Mith,” is a brutal and dissonant song called “I Woke Up in a Fucked-Up America.” The title could refer to the nation right now, or to Holley’s childhood in the pre-civil-rights-era South. He was born in Birmingham, Alabama, in 1950, the seventh of twenty-seven children, and brought up by an itinerant burlesque dancer who may have stolen him from his biological mother. At the age of four, he says, he was traded for a bottle of whiskey. Later, after he fled the home of an abusive foster parent, he was hit by a car and declared brain-dead. At eleven, he was sent to the Alabama Industrial School for Negro Children, an infamous juvenile facility in Montgomery County, where he picked cotton and collected trash from the side of the highway. After he got out, he took a job as a short-order cook at Disney World. Eventually, he found work as a gravedigger."],["p","Holley is surely aware that there is significant power in mythmaking. Art that feels like the product of an unlikely journey is frequently presumed to be more authentic; if that journey is marked by disenfranchisement and injustice, the work becomes doubly profound. The culture fetishizes and rewards an unorthodox path—or, at least, the appearance of an unorthodox path—so there is value, sometimes, in embellishing the details. The title of Holley’s new album (and its purposeful misspelling) seems like a nod to the practice and the tradition of folklore."],["p","For the record: the burlesque dancer who raised Holley was supposed to watch him for only a few days. When she and Holley visited a so-called whiskey house on the edge of the Alabama state fairgrounds, the proprietor noticed that Holley appeared underfed, and offered to take care of him. He didn’t flee, but got lost while searching for his birth mother. Holley’s paternal grandmother eventually took him in. She was a devout Baptist, and hoped that Holley might become a preacher, but he found that the church alone couldn’t contain his generative spirit."],["p","Holley figured out that he was a talented sculptor while fashioning ad-hoc tombstones for his sister’s two young children, who had died in a house fire. His career as a visual artist began in earnest in 1981, when he delivered a few examples of his sandstone carvings to the director of the Birmingham Museum of Art, who agreed to display them. In the mid-eighties, Holley met ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/08/12/composition-in-black-and-white-2"},"Bill Arnett"],", a collector known for sponsoring and promoting self-taught black artists from the South. Arnett helped Holley place his work in more museums and private collections. (Arnett has also raised the profile of the sculptor Thornton Dial, and of the quilters of Gee’s Bend, Alabama.) Holley’s sculptures have since been displayed in the White House Rose Garden and the Smithsonian Institution, and at the United Nations. He assembles the pieces, which are heavy with personal and political meaning, from scavenged widgets and rusty bits of trash that he often lashes together with barbed wire."],["p","Holley didn’t begin releasing music until 2012, when he was sixty-two. His voice is sometimes gruff and sometimes honeyed—a mixture of Tom Waits and Marvin Gaye. He started out creating songs on a Casio keyboard that he purchased at a Goodwill store, and first recorded his work on a karaoke machine from a flea market. With some assistance from Arnett’s son, Matt, who now manages Holley’s music career, Holley signed to Dust-to-Digital, an Atlanta-based record label that specializes in the artful excavation and repackaging of lost or underappreciated music. “Mith,” which was released by Jagjaguwar last month, is Holley’s third record."],["p","Holley’s music, which is largely improvised, contains hints of Stevie Wonder, Sun Ra, Lou Reed, ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/04/24/alice-coltranes-devotional-music"},"Alice Coltrane"],", Gil Scott-Heron, ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/miles-davis"},"Miles Davis"],", and at least a dozen other singers and composers. His precise influences are difficult to identify and parse. Holley is interested in mélange—the soldering together of disparate objects or ideas, in order to build something that feels both new and borrowed. On paper, this might sound like an intellectual exercise—especially since his work is often explicitly political—but, in practice, his music is strange and warm. Unlike some experimental musicians, who rely on drone and discord to unsettle their listeners, Holley does not seem to have an antagonistic relationship with his audience; he merely wants to pull people deeper into his embrace."],["p","“Mith” contains an almost eighteen-minute song titled “I Snuck Off the Slave Ship.” “Tossing us down in the galleys / Tossing us down into darkness / So many humans crying / Whining, wiggling, and moving,” Holley sings, his voice clear over a haze of loops and synthesizers. Ultimately, it’s a song about perseverance. Holley often quotes Martin Luther King, Jr.,’s “I’ve Been to the Mountaintop” speech, which King delivered to sanitation workers in Memphis the day before he was assassinated. King shared the details of his “mental flight” to ancient Egypt, “through the wilderness, on toward the promised land.” On “I Snuck Off the Slave Ship,” Holley’s mental flight involves dissociation: he leaves his body, and floats to shore. His spiritual journey continues from there, through humankind’s innovations and failures—the Hindenburg, space shuttles, satellites, the “windows of technology.” Imagination becomes a way of saving yourself, and a method of taking stock. It’s also required for creative improvisation. Holley prefers to reinvent his songs each time he plays them. The idea is to close your eyes and see where you land."]],["inline-embed",{"type":"section","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22section%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cp%3EPopular%20music%20hasn%E2%80%99t%20struggled%20quite%20as%20much%20as%20visual%20art%20has%20with%20the%20seemingly%20paradoxical%20phrase%20%E2%80%9Coutsider%20art.%E2%80%9D%20Following%20the%20considerable%20commercial%20success%20of%20rock%20and%20roll%2C%20the%20high-versus-low%20divide%20in%20popular%20music%20was%20largely%20obliterated%3B%20an%20anti-authoritarian%20quality%20was%20recognized%20as%20plainly%20profitable%20in%20a%20pop%20or%20rock%20star.%20Still%2C%20there%20are%20a%20handful%20of%20unclassifiable%20artists%20(%3Ca%20href%3D%5C%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fculture%2Fculture-desk%2Fworking-through-the-sadness-of-daniel-johnstons-lastfor-nowtour%5C%22%3EDaniel%20Johnston%3C%2Fa%3E%2C%20Wesley%20Willis%2C%20Moondog)%20who%20have%20been%20stuck%20with%20the%20%E2%80%9Coutsider%E2%80%9D%20tag.%20It%20occasionally%20comes%20up%20in%20conversations%20about%20Holley%2C%20perhaps%20because%20his%20music%20can%E2%80%99t%20be%20easily%20slotted%20into%20a%20continuum.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EThe%20cover%20of%20%E2%80%9CMith%E2%80%9D%20features%20a%20blurry%20black-and-white%20portrait%20of%20Holley%2C%20giving%20a%20thumbs-up.%20The%20gesture%20feels%20genuine.%20He%20is%20inviting%20us%20to%20try%20to%20make%20sense%20of%20the%20world%20together.%20In%20person%2C%20Holley%20has%20an%20almost%20shamanistic%20quality%2C%20as%20if%20he%20possessed%20all%20the%20wisdom%20of%20the%20universe%2C%20and%20would%20happily%20share%20it%20with%20you%2C%20if%20you%20let%20him.%20He%20is%20beautiful%3A%20long%2C%20graying%20dreadlocks%2C%20wrists%20full%20of%20bracelets%2C%20and%20a%20ring%20(or%20two%20or%20three%20or%20four)%20on%20every%20finger.%20This%20spring%2C%20I%20saw%20him%20perform%20at%20the%20Mariposa%20Museum%20and%20World%20Culture%20Center%2C%20in%20Peterborough%2C%20New%20Hampshire%2C%20as%20part%20of%20a%20local%20music-and-arts%20festival.%20A%20gallery%20around%20the%20corner%20was%20hosting%20an%20exhibit%20of%20Holley%E2%80%99s%20art%20work%2C%20so%20it%20was%20possible%20to%20see%20his%20sculptures%20before%20settling%20in%20for%20the%20show%2C%20and%20to%20ponder%20the%20relation%20between%20his%20chosen%20forms.%20All%20his%20work%20is%20focussed%20on%20ideas%20of%20history%20and%20invention%E2%80%94how%20we%20can%20use%20the%20past%20to%20unlock%20the%20future.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3ETo%20fully%20understand%20his%20work%2C%20it%E2%80%99s%20important%20to%20watch%20him%20make%20it.%20He%20improvises%20a%20new%20set%20every%20time%20he%20plays.%20In%20New%20Hampshire%2C%20he%20had%20his%20eyeglasses%20pushed%20up%20on%20his%20forehead%2C%20and%20his%20keyboard%20was%20wrapped%20in%20a%20blue%20quilt%20with%20the%20letter%20%E2%80%9CH%E2%80%9D%20in%20the%20middle.%20He%20opened%20with%20a%20long%2C%20meandering%20interpretation%20of%20%E2%80%9CI%E2%80%99m%20a%20Suspect%2C%E2%80%9D%20from%20%E2%80%9CMith.%E2%80%9D%20It%E2%80%99s%20a%20song%20about%20prejudice.%20%E2%80%9CNo%20matter%20if%20I%E2%80%99m%20up%20or%20if%20I%E2%80%99m%20down%C2%A0%2F%C2%A0I%E2%80%99m%20a%20suspect%C2%A0%2F%C2%A0In%20America%2C%E2%80%9D%20Holley%20sings.%20The%20chorus%20(if%20you%20can%20call%20it%20that%E2%80%94his%20work%20largely%20resists%20structure)%20became%20a%20stabbing%20proclamation%3A%20%E2%80%9CI%E2%80%99m%20a%20sus!%20Pect!%E2%80%9D%20He%20repeated%20the%20phrase%20until%20it%20felt%20like%20a%20mantra.%20His%20backing%20band%E2%80%94the%20multi-instrumentalist%20Shahzad%20Ismaily%2C%20the%20trombonist%20Dave%20Nelson%2C%20and%20the%20percussionist%20Marlon%20Patton%E2%80%94added%20spontaneous%20ornamentation.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EWhen%20Holley%20gets%20going%2C%20he%20conjures%20something%20in%20a%20room.%20There%20is%20his%20own%20trance%E2%80%94he%20disappears%20into%20a%20song%2C%20and%20goes%20soft%20around%20the%20edges%E2%80%94and%20the%20audience%E2%80%99s%20collective%20trip.%20%E2%80%9CWatch%20me%20deteriorate%20into%20a%20dust%20speck%2C%E2%80%9D%20he%20sang.%20For%20me%2C%20the%20Mariposa%20show%20felt%20like%20a%20kind%20of%20glorious%20refuge%2C%20in%20which%20the%20sins%20of%20our%20ancestors%20were%20seen%20and%20sublimated.%20What%20Holley%E2%80%99s%20offering%20isn%E2%80%99t%20forgiveness%2C%20exactly%2C%20but%20something%20more%20like%20love.%C2%A0%E2%99%A6%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%22%7D","ref":""},["p","Popular music hasn’t struggled quite as much as visual art has with the seemingly paradoxical phrase “outsider art.” Following the considerable commercial success of rock and roll, the high-versus-low divide in popular music was largely obliterated; an anti-authoritarian quality was recognized as plainly profitable in a pop or rock star. Still, there are a handful of unclassifiable artists (",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/working-through-the-sadness-of-daniel-johnstons-lastfor-nowtour"},"Daniel Johnston"],", Wesley Willis, Moondog) who have been stuck with the “outsider” tag. It occasionally comes up in conversations about Holley, perhaps because his music can’t be easily slotted into a continuum."],["p","The cover of “Mith” features a blurry black-and-white portrait of Holley, giving a thumbs-up. The gesture feels genuine. He is inviting us to try to make sense of the world together. In person, Holley has an almost shamanistic quality, as if he possessed all the wisdom of the universe, and would happily share it with you, if you let him. He is beautiful: long, graying dreadlocks, wrists full of bracelets, and a ring (or two or three or four) on every finger. This spring, I saw him perform at the Mariposa Museum and World Culture Center, in Peterborough, New Hampshire, as part of a local music-and-arts festival. A gallery around the corner was hosting an exhibit of Holley’s art work, so it was possible to see his sculptures before settling in for the show, and to ponder the relation between his chosen forms. All his work is focussed on ideas of history and invention—how we can use the past to unlock the future."],["p","To fully understand his work, it’s important to watch him make it. He improvises a new set every time he plays. In New Hampshire, he had his eyeglasses pushed up on his forehead, and his keyboard was wrapped in a blue quilt with the letter “H” in the middle. He opened with a long, meandering interpretation of “I’m a Suspect,” from “Mith.” It’s a song about prejudice. “No matter if I’m up or if I’m down / I’m a suspect / In America,” Holley sings. The chorus (if you can call it that—his work largely resists structure) became a stabbing proclamation: “I’m a sus! Pect!” He repeated the phrase until it felt like a mantra. His backing band—the multi-instrumentalist Shahzad Ismaily, the trombonist Dave Nelson, and the percussionist Marlon Patton—added spontaneous ornamentation."],["p","When Holley gets going, he conjures something in a room. There is his own trance—he disappears into a song, and goes soft around the edges—and the audience’s collective trip. “Watch me deteriorate into a dust speck,” he sang. For me, the Mariposa show felt like a kind of glorious refuge, in which the sins of our ancestors were seen and sublimated. What Holley’s offering isn’t forgiveness, exactly, but something more like love. ♦"]]],"canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"sections":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"},"slug":"magazine","children":[{"id":"59112013df652b705f4ab93f","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"59112013df652b705f4ab93f","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Pop

(Ahmadinejad also praised Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf, an N.B.A. player known for protesting during the national anthem in the nineteen-nineties.) But sports fans took note of the Kaepernick tweet. A dispirited University of Michigan football fan responded, seeking answers about the team’s coach, who has not been the savior fans expected: “Dear Mahmoud, We have much bigger problems here. #Michigan is 8–8 in its last 16 games under @CoachJim4UM.” Surprisingly, Ahmadinejad wrote back: “With a hard work ethic Inshallah the U of M will return to its glory days.”"],["p","This opened the floodgates. “Salam Mahmoud, first time long time,” a Twitter user named David wrote to Ahmadinejad, using the sports talk-radio salute for first-time callers. “What do you think Texas’s final record ends up at?”"],["p","“Mahmoud, do you think Kevin Durant will go to the Knicks . . . ?”"],["p","“Will the Big 12 be left without a playoff team this year? I’ll hang up and listen.”"],["p","Could Ahmadinejad be America’s newest purveyor of hot sports takes?

Seeger was twenty-one when he wrote to his local draft board to say, “I have concluded that war, from the practical standpoint, is futile and self-defeating, and from the more important moral standpoint, it is unethical.” Some time later, he received the United States Selective Service System’s Form 150, asking him to detail his objections to military service. It took him a few days to reply, because he had no answer for the form’s first question: “Do you believe in a Supreme Being?”"],["p","Unsatisfied with the two available options—“Yes” and “No”—Seeger finally decided to draw and check a third box: “See attached pages.” There were eight of those pages, and in them he described reading Plato, Aristotle, and Spinoza, all of whom “evolved comprehensive ethical systems of intellectual and moral integrity without belief in God,” and concluded that “the existence of God cannot be proven or disproven, and the essence of His nature cannot be determined.” For good measure, Seeger also used scare quotes and strike-throughs to doctor the printed statement he was required to sign, so that it read, “I am, by reason of my ‘religious’ ",["del","training and"]," belief, conscientiously opposed to participation in war in any form.”"],["p","By the time Seeger submitted his form, in the late nineteen-fifties, thousands of conscientious objectors in the U.S. had refused to fight in the two World Wars. Those who belonged to pacifist religious traditions, such as Mennonites and Quakers, were sent to war as noncombatants or to work as farmers or firefighters on the home front through the Civilian Public Service; eventually, so were those who could prove their own independent, religiously motivated pacifism. Those who could not were sent to prison or to labor camps. But while Selective Service laws had been revised again and again to clarify the criteria for conscientious objection, they still did not account for young men who, like Seeger, refused to say that their opposition to war came from belief in a Supreme Being."],["p","Over time, draft boards came to resemble freshman philosophy seminars in their attempts to decide who did and did not qualify for C.O. status. A Jewish socialist who ran an engraving business did not, but a pulp artist and atheist who appealed to the idea of secular humanism did; some members of the Ethical Culture Society qualified, but not others; Jehovah’s Witnesses initially did not, on the theory that someone willing to fight the Devil during Armageddon ought to be willing to fight America’s enemies during a war; a writer turned financial consultant who belonged to no church but had read “philosophers, historians, and poets from Plato to Shaw” was granted C.O. status after two contradictory close readings of his antiwar play. Different boards reached very different conclusions, various appeal boards upheld and reversed those decisions without much consistency, and, inevitably, some of those appeals ended up before federal courts. When Seeger’s local board was unmoved by his argument, he took it all the way to the Supreme Court, where, in 1965, the Justices found unanimously that a draftee did not need to believe in God in order to have a conscience that could object."],["p","Seeger’s victory helped mark a turning point for a minority that had once been denied so much as the right to testify in court, even in their own defense. Atheists, long discriminated against by civil authorities and derided by their fellow-citizens, were suddenly eligible for some of the exemptions and protections that had previously been restricted to believers. But, in the decades since U.S. v. Seeger, despite an increase in the number of people who identify as nonbelievers, their standing before the courts and in the public sphere has been slow to improve. Americans, in large numbers, still do not want atheists teaching their children, or marrying them. They would, according to surveys, prefer a female, gay, Mormon, or Muslim President to having an atheist in the White House, and some of them do not object to attempts to keep nonbelievers from holding other offices, even when the office is that of notary public. Atheists are not welcome in the Masonic Lodge, and while the Boy Scouts of America has opened its organization to gays and to girls, it continues to bar any participant who will not pledge “to do my duty to God.”"],["p","Such discrimination is both a cause and an effect of the crude way in which we parse belief, which has barely changed since Daniel Seeger completed his C.O. application: check “Yes” and endless questions follow; check “No” and the questioning ends. Lack of belief in God is still too often taken to mean the absence of any other meaningful moral beliefs, and that has made atheists an easy minority to revile. This is especially true in America, where an insistence on the idea that we are a Christian nation has tied patriotism to religiosity, leading to such strange paroxysms as the one produced by President Trump at last year’s Values Voter Summit: “In America, we don’t worship government—we worship God.”"],["p","As that remark suggests, the one wall the current Administration does not want to build is the one between church and state. The most evident manifestation of this resurgence of Christian nationalism has been animosity toward Muslims and Jews, but the group most literally excluded from any godly vision of America is, of course, atheists.

From John Locke they inherited the idea that atheists cannot be good citizens and should not be brought into the social contract; in “A Letter Concerning Toleration,” Locke had written, “Those are not at all to be tolerated who deny the being of a God.”"],["p","True religious liberty was rare in the colonies: dissenters were fined, flogged, jailed, and sometimes hanged. Yet, surprisingly, no atheist was ever executed. According to the Cornell professors R. Laurence Moore and Isaac Kramnick, the authors of the new book “Godless Citizens in a Godly Republic: Atheists in American Public Life” (Norton), that is only because no atheists presented themselves for execution. Nonbelievers were either few and far between in Colonial America or understandably cautious about making themselves known; clergy and magistrates rarely bothered to mention them, even derisively."],["p","One of the few who did was Roger Williams, who, after he was banished from the Massachusetts Bay Colony for spreading “diverse, new, and dangerous opinions,” offered a view of the separation of church and state so extreme that it seemed to accommodate atheists. In his book “The Bloudy Tenent of Persecution, for Cause of Conscience,” published in London in 1644, Williams wrote that “a pagan or Antichristian pilot may be as skillful to carry the ship to its desired port, as any Christian mariner.” He was referring to the ship of state, but his tolerance was never fully tested: no atheist ever tried to hold office in Rhode Island, the colony that he founded. Still, his argument was audacious for an era when most colonies had established churches and collected ecclesiastical taxes to support them."],["p","It was striking, then, after the Revolutionary War, when the men who gathered for the Constitutional Convention banned religious tests for office holders, in Article VI. There would be no government church, no state religion, and, except for being signed in the Year of our Lord 1787, no mention of God in America’s founding text. Religious freedom was formally established in the Constitution’s First Amendment. “The Godless Constitution,” as Moore and Kramnick called it in a previous book, was mostly the product of Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, who fought to keep God out of the document. But, while neither was a creedal Christian, both men were monotheists, and, like John Locke, their ideas about tolerance generally extended only to those who believed in a higher power."],["p","It was another one of the revolutionaries who became a hero for the nonreligious. Thomas Paine, whose “Common Sense” had sold half a million copies the year that the United States declared its independence, died an outcast because of a later pamphlet he wrote on religion. Attacking the King of England was fine, but when Paine, in “The Age of Reason,” set his sights on the King of Kings, he was derided as a “loathsome reptile” and a “filthy little atheist.” It didn’t matter that Paine, like Jefferson, actually identified as a Deist, or that his text opens with the blunt declaration “I believe in one God”; his criticisms of Christianity were so scandalous that he was written into history as a nonbeliever."],["p","Such is the slippery label of “atheist” in the American context: slapped on those who explicitly reject it, eschewed by unbelievers who wish to avoid its stigma. Both atheists and their critics often make a hopeless muddle of the category, sometimes because it is genuinely complicated to assess belief, but often for other reasons. Some atheists try to claim as one of their own everyone, dead or alive, who has ever thought twice about religion—and there’s a bit of this slippage in Moore and Kramnick, where the religiously unaffiliated (the so-called “nones”) are all equated with the unbelieving. Some believers, meanwhile, use atheism to discredit anyone with whom they do not agree."],["p","For atheists, at least, this definitional elasticity provided a kind of safety in numbers, however inflated: as their ranks grew, so did their willingness to make their controversial beliefs public. In the nineteenth century, Robert Ingersoll, “the Great Agnostic,” charged a dollar a head to the thousands who gathered to hear him critique Christianity; believers and skeptics had months-long exchanges in the pages of newspapers; and debates between the likes of the secularist J. Spencer Ellis and the theist Miles Grant packed venues the way that Sam Harris vs. William Lane Craig and Bill Nye vs. Ken Ham do today."],["p","With nonbelievers starting to assert themselves, believers began more aggressively protecting their faith from offense or scrutiny. Blasphemy laws were enforced against those who insulted God, Jesus Christ, the Holy Spirit, or the Bible. A former Baptist minister turned freethinker named Abner Kneeland was arrested in Massachusetts for an article that he wrote explaining why he no longer believed in a monotheistic God; not even the prominent Unitarian preacher William Ellery Channing or the former Unitarian pastor Ralph Waldo Emerson, both of whom rose to Kneeland’s defense, could spare him jail time. In New York, a man named John Ruggles was sentenced to three months for insulting Jesus; in Pennsylvania, another man, Abner Updegraph, was fined for calling the Bible “a mere fable” that contained “a great many lies.” (Laws against blasphemy, though rarely enforced, still exist in Massachusetts, Michigan, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and Wyoming.) All but three states passed Sabbatarian laws, which were imposed on everyone, including religious observers whose Sabbath did not fall on Sunday. (Such prohibitions linger in blue laws, which now mostly restrict the sale of alcohol on Sunday.) One Jewish merchant took his case all the way to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, only to be denied an exemption because, in the words of the court, “Whatever strikes at the root of Christianity tends manifestly to the dissolution of civil government.”"],["p","Few, if any, of those prosecuted for violating Sabbatarian or blasphemy laws actually identified as atheists, but that didn’t stop their critics from denouncing them as such. Indeed, the charge of atheism became a convenient means of discrediting nontheological beliefs, including anarchism, radicalism, socialism, and feminism. Elizabeth Cady Stanton’s agnosticism and Ernestine Rose’s atheism were held against the early suffragists, and after eight allegedly godless anarchists were convicted of killing eleven people during Chicago’s Haymarket affair and President William McKinley was assassinated by an anarchist who had rejected Catholic teachings, atheism became linked, in the popular imagination, with domestic terrorism. “Public attacks on religion,” Moore and Kramnick write in their account of how atheism became un-American, “were presumed to lead to the advocacy of other dangerous ideas.”"],["p","That presumption became both more popular and more potent during the Cold War. It wasn’t politics or economics, some said, that distinguished America from its enemies—it was religiosity. “From the root of atheism stems the evil weed of communism,” the Catholic congressman Louis Rabaut declared, on the floor of the House of Representatives. Two centuries after the Founders wrote a godless constitution, the federal government got religion: between 1953 and 1957, a prayer breakfast appeared on the White House calendar, a prayer room opened in the Capitol, “In God We Trust” was added to all currency, and “under God” was inserted into the Pledge of Allegiance. The Founders had already chosen a motto, of course, but ",["em","E pluribus unum"]," proved too secular for the times. Even as courts were striking down blasphemy laws and recognizing the rights of nontheists to conscientious-objector status, legislators around the country were trying to promote Christianity in a way that did not violate the establishment clause. They succeeded, albeit at a price: the courts upheld references to God in pledges, oaths, prayers, and anthems on the ground that they were not actually religious. The phrase “ceremonial deism” was coined by a Yale Law School dean in 1962, and in the decades since it has been used by court after court to explain exceptions to the First Amendment. Like saying “God bless you” when someone sneezes, the courts concluded, these “under God”s and “In God We Trust”s are innocuous; they belong to the realm of patriotism, not prayer."],["p","Not surprisingly, neither believers nor nonbelievers believe this. Every such ruling is a Pyrrhic victory for the devout, for whom invocations of God are sacred, and no victory at all for atheists, for whom invocations of God, when sponsored by the state, are obvious attempts to promote religion. Legal challenges to the Pledge of Allegiance, in particular, persist, because nonbelievers are concerned about its prominence in the daily lives of schoolchildren. Lawsuits to end the recitation of the Pledge in public schools began almost as soon as the words “under God” were added, and while “ceremonial deism” long thwarted those challenges, nonbelievers have lately begun to pursue a different strategy. Instead of arguing that the Pledge violates the First Amendment’s establishment clause, they have started arguing that it violates the Fourteenth Amendment’s equal-protection clause, because it presents an occasion for nonbelieving children to be ostracized. David Niose, the legal director of the American Humanist Association, is one of many who have suggested that atheists might even be a suspect class, the sort of minority who deserve special protections from the courts."]],["inline-embed",{"type":"section","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22section%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cp%3EBut%20are%20atheists%20a%20suspect%20class%2C%20or%20just%20a%20skeptical%20one%3F%20Unlike%20racial%20minorities%2C%20their%20condition%20is%20not%20immutable%2C%20but%2C%20like%20many%20religious%20minorities%2C%20they%20are%20subject%20to%20hostility%20and%20prejudice.%20Atheism%2C%20however%2C%20is%20not%20a%20single%20identity%2C%20ideology%2C%20or%20set%20of%20practices%2C%20and%20to%20speak%20of%20it%20that%20way%20is%20as%20reductive%20as%20speaking%20of%20%E2%80%9Creligion%E2%80%9D%20rather%20than%20of%20Judaism%2C%20Buddhism%2C%20or%20Christianity%E2%80%94or%2C%20even%20more%20usefully%2C%20of%20Reform%20Judaism%2C%20Mahayana%20Buddhism%2C%20or%20Pentecostalism.%20%E2%80%9CAtheisms%E2%80%9D%20is%20a%20more%20precise%20concept%2C%20as%20the%20philosopher%20John%20Gray%20demonstrates%20in%20his%20new%20book%2C%20%E2%80%9CSeven%20Types%20of%20Atheism%E2%80%9D%20(Farrar%2C%20Straus%20%26amp%3B%20Giroux)%2C%20and%20one%20that%20could%20help%20Americans%20move%20beyond%20their%20intractable%20fight%20over%20the%20existence%20of%20God.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EGray%2C%20who%20taught%20at%20Oxford%2C%20Harvard%2C%20Yale%2C%20and%20the%20London%20School%20of%20Economics%20before%20turning%20full%20time%20to%20writing%2C%20starts%20by%20offering%20a%20highly%20provisional%20and%20idiosyncratic%20definition%20of%20%E2%80%9Catheist%E2%80%9D%3A%20%E2%80%9Canyone%20with%20no%20use%20for%20a%20divine%20mind%20that%20has%20fashioned%20the%20world.%E2%80%9D%20As%20he%20concedes%2C%20that%20makes%20the%20category%20so%20capacious%20that%20it%20includes%20some%20of%20the%20world%E2%80%99s%20major%20religions%3A%20neither%20Buddhism%20nor%20Taoism%20features%20a%20creator%20god.%20Yet%20that%20capaciousness%20is%20appropriate%2C%20because%20it%20suggests%2C%20correctly%2C%20that%20there%20is%20no%20single%20atheistic%20world%20view.%20Much%20of%20the%20animosity%20and%20opprobrium%20directed%20at%20nonbelievers%20in%20America%20comes%20from%20the%20suspicion%20that%20those%20who%20do%20not%20believe%20in%20God%20could%20not%20possibly%20believe%20in%20anything%20else%2C%20moral%20or%20otherwise.%20The%20reason%20that%20atheists%20were%20not%20allowed%20to%20testify%20in%20court%20for%20so%20long%20was%20the%20certainty%20that%20witnesses%20who%20were%20unwilling%20to%20swear%20an%20oath%20to%20God%20had%20no%20reason%20to%20be%20truthful%2C%20since%20they%20did%20not%20fear%20divine%20judgment.%20Gray%E2%80%99s%20survey%2C%20while%20not%20comprehensive%2C%20is%20a%20welcome%20corrective%20to%20that%20ungenerous%20view.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EIt%20is%20also%20a%20refreshing%20look%20beyond%20the%20so-called%20%E2%80%9Cnew%20atheists%E2%80%9D%20who%20have%20lately%20dominated%20the%20conversation%20surrounding%20unbelief.%20Gray%20does%20not%20brook%20what%20he%20describes%20as%20their%20%E2%80%9Ctedious%20re-run%20of%20a%20Victorian%20squabble%20between%20science%20and%20religion%2C%E2%80%9D%20and%2C%20in%20contrast%20to%20Moore%20and%20Kramnick%2C%20who%20believe%20that%20new%20atheists%20like%20Sam%20Harris%20and%20Richard%20Dawkins%20have%20generated%20an%20%E2%80%9CAtheist%20Awakening%2C%E2%80%9D%20Gray%20dismisses%20them%20in%20a%20single%20chapter.%20%E2%80%9CNew%20atheists%20have%20directed%20their%20campaign%20against%20a%20narrow%20segment%20of%20religion%20while%20failing%20to%20understand%20even%20that%20small%20part%2C%E2%80%9D%20he%20writes.%20By%20Gray%E2%80%99s%20account%2C%20they%20ignore%20polytheism%20and%20animism%20almost%20entirely%2C%20while%20insisting%20on%20reading%20verses%20of%20Genesis%20or%20lines%20of%20the%20Nicene%20Creed%20as%20if%20they%20were%20primitive%20scientific%20theories.%20Not%20all%20monotheists%20are%20literalists%2C%20and%2C%20for%20many%20of%20us%2C%20both%20now%20and%20throughout%20history%2C%20the%20Garden%20of%20Eden%20is%20not%20a%20faulty%20hypothesis%20about%20evolution%20but%20a%20rich%20symbolic%20story%20about%20good%20and%20evil.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EGray%E2%80%99s%20larger%20complaint%20is%20that%20the%20new%20atheists%20fail%20to%20offer%20a%20more%20coherent%20moral%20vision%20than%20the%20one%20they%20want%20to%20replace.%20The%20strategy%20they%20champion%2C%20scientific%20ethics%2C%20has%20been%20tried%20before%2C%20with%20a%20notable%20lack%20of%20success.%20Auguste%20Comte%20and%20his%20fellow%20nineteenth-century%20positivists%20envisioned%20a%20Grand%20Pontiff%20of%20Humanity%20who%20would%20preside%20alongside%20scientist-priests%3B%20unfortunately%2C%20scientists%20at%20the%20time%20were%20practicing%20phrenology.%20Later%20on%2C%20evolutionary%20humanists%20and%20monists%20replaced%20God%E2%80%99s%20order%20with%20%E2%80%9Cscientific%E2%80%9D%20anthropologies%2C%20then%20constructed%20racial%20hierarchies%20and%20put%20white%20Europeans%20on%20top.%20Today%2C%20the%20voguish%20version%20of%20science%20as%20religion%20is%20transhumanism%2C%20which%20cla

Atheism, however, is not a single identity, ideology, or set of practices, and to speak of it that way is as reductive as speaking of “religion” rather than of Judaism, Buddhism, or Christianity—or, even more usefully, of Reform Judaism, Mahayana Buddhism, or Pentecostalism. “Atheisms” is a more precise concept, as the philosopher John Gray demonstrates in his new book, “Seven Types of Atheism” (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux), and one that could help Americans move beyond their intractable fight over the existence of God."],["p","Gray, who taught at Oxford, Harvard, Yale, and the London School of Economics before turning full time to writing, starts by offering a highly provisional and idiosyncratic definition of “atheist”: “anyone with no use for a divine mind that has fashioned the world.” As he concedes, that makes the category so capacious that it includes some of the world’s major religions: neither Buddhism nor Taoism features a creator god. Yet that capaciousness is appropriate, because it suggests, correctly, that there is no single atheistic world view. Much of the animosity and opprobrium directed at nonbelievers in America comes from the suspicion that those who do not believe in God could not possibly believe in anything else, moral or otherwise. The reason that atheists were not allowed to testify in court for so long was the certainty that witnesses who were unwilling to swear an oath to God had no reason to be truthful, since they did not fear divine judgment. Gray’s survey, while not comprehensive, is a welcome corrective to that ungenerous view."],["p","It is also a refreshing look beyond the so-called “new atheists” who have lately dominated the conversation surrounding unbelief. Gray does not brook what he describes as their “tedious re-run of a Victorian squabble between science and religion,” and, in contrast to Moore and Kramnick, who believe that new atheists like Sam Harris and Richard Dawkins have generated an “Atheist Awakening,” Gray dismisses them in a single chapter. “New atheists have directed their campaign against a narrow segment of religion while failing to understand even that small part,” he writes. By Gray’s account, they ignore polytheism and animism almost entirely, while insisting on reading verses of Genesis or lines of the Nicene Creed as if they were primitive scientific theories. Not all monotheists are literalists, and, for many of us, both now and throughout history, the Garden of Eden is not a faulty hypothesis about evolution but a rich symbolic story about good and evil."],["p","Gray’s larger complaint is that the new atheists fail to offer a more coherent moral vision than the one they want to replace. The strategy they champion, scientific ethics, has been tried before, with a notable lack of success. Auguste Comte and his fellow nineteenth-century positivists envisioned a Grand Pontiff of Humanity who would preside alongside scientist-priests; unfortunately, scientists at the time were practicing phrenology. Later on, evolutionary humanists and monists replaced God’s order with “scientific” anthropologies, then constructed racial hierarchies and put white Europeans on top. Today, the voguish version of science as religion is transhumanism, which claims that technology will overcome human limitations both physical and mental, perhaps through bioengineering or artificial intelligence or cyborgs that can carry around the contents of our brains. Gray is not sanguine about such developments, should they ever occur, because we already have a model of the mayhem that takes place when some mortals are granted godlike powers: “Anyone who wants a glimpse of what a post-human future might be like should read Homer.”"],["p","On the whole, Gray is a glass-half-empty kind of guy, and what others regard as novel or promising he often sees as derivative or just plain dumb. He argues, for instance, that secular humanism is really monotheism in disguise, where humankind is God and salvation can be achieved through our own efforts rather than through divine intervention. Unlike the linguist—and new atheist—Steven Pinker, Gray regards the idea that the world is getting better as self-evidently silly. “The cumulative increase of knowledge in science has no parallel in ethics or politics,” he points out. Religions are still thriving, as are wars between them, and secular regimes have wrought as much, if not more, havoc under the auspices of Jacobinism, Bolshevism, Nazism, and Maoism."],["p","Gray is especially interested in those atheists who, in addition to having no faith in the divine, have none in humanity. (Given his own intellectual bent, one suspects him of delighting equally in their pessimism and their unpopularity.) These aren’t misotheists—those who hate God, like the Marquis de Sade, many new atheists, and the literary critic William Empson, whose “Seven Types of Ambiguity” Gray cites as an influence. They are thinkers like George Santayana, a thoroughgoing materialist who scoffed at human progress to the point of indifference to human suffering yet loved Catholic traditions so much that he chose to live out the end of his days in the care of nuns. Similarly, the novelist Joseph Conrad had no faith in God, and lost his faith in progress after witnessing the colonization of Congo, but he wrote beautifully about those who faced their empty fate head on: sailors surviving the indifference of the sea. Such men—and almost all the atheists in Gray’s book are men—would not recognize the hopeful atheism that is all the rage today. (Gray does make space for Ayn Rand, who briefly steals the show, as her followers raise their cigarette holders in tandem with hers, marry mates chosen by “the Collective,” and tap-dance at their weddings because Rand deemed it the only truly rational form of dance.)"],["p","Gray is equally interested in, and especially drawn to, those who practice what he calls “the atheism of silence.” These atheists, like those who reject the notion of human progress, don’t often attract large followings. Instead of seeking surrogates for God, they try to acquiesce in something that transcends human understanding. Gray admires the mystical atheist Arthur Schopenhauer, who didn’t believe in God and didn’t particularly believe in reality, either. Gray also includes in this category thinkers who were clearly devout, such as Spinoza, who rejected a creator God but saw God as an eternal substance in all creation, and the Russian philosopher Lev Shestov, who wrote that reason had to be overcome in order for us to know God, and that revelation “carries us beyond the limits of all human comprehension and of the possibilities that comprehension admits.”"],["p","This kind of apophatic theology has a lot in common with godless mysticism, Gray argues, because saying that God does not exist is not so different from saying that we cannot comprehend God’s existence. In both cases, the material world may be characterized by limited understanding and limitless wonder. That is the charity so seldom extended to atheists in America: the notion that they, too, may be awed by and struggling to make sense of the human and the cosmic. “A godless world is as mysterious as one suffused with divinity, and the difference between the two may be less than you think,” Gray writes."]],["inline-embed",{"type":"section","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22section%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cp%3ECosmologies%2C%20in%20other%20words%2C%20can%20make%20for%20strange%20bedfellows%2C%20and%20some%20of%20what%20Gray%20does%20best%20in%20%E2%80%9CSeven%20Types%20of%20Atheism%E2%80%9D%20is%20not%20only%20to%20draw%20distinctions%20among%20atheists%20but%20to%20make%20connections%20between%20nonbelievers%20and%20believers.%20Christians%20ignorant%20of%20their%20own%20history%2C%20for%20instance%2C%20will%20be%20surprised%20to%20learn%20that%20their%20earliest%20ancestors%20in%20the%20faith%20were%20themselves%20ridiculed%20as%20%E2%80%9Catheists%E2%80%9D%20because%20they%20refused%20to%20participate%20in%20polytheistic%20worship%3A%20in%20Greek%2C%20%3Cem%3Eatheos%3C%2Fem%3E%20means%20%E2%80%9Cwithout%20gods%2C%E2%80%9D%20not%20anti-God.%20Meanwhile%2C%20those%20who%20came%20to%20atheism%20via%20the%20new%20atheists%20might%20be%20startled%20to%20find%20that%20many%20of%20their%20intellectual%20forebears%20did%20not%20wage%20war%20on%20religion%2C%20or%20even%20feel%20any%20distaste%20for%20it.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EIn%20fairness%2C%20contemporary%20American%20atheists%20may%20be%20inclined%20to%20wage%20war%20on%20religion%20because%20religion%20has%20been%20waging%20war%20on%20them%20for%20so%20long.%20A%20brief%20truce%20was%20reached%20at%20the%20end%20of%20the%20Obama%20Administration%2C%20when%20Congress%20passed%2C%20and%20the%20President%20signed%2C%20a%20new%20version%20of%20the%20International%20Religious%20Freedom%20Act%20that%20officially%20included%20nonbelievers.%20%E2%80%9CThe%20freedom%20of%20thought%2C%20conscience%2C%20and%20religion%20is%20understood%20to%20protect%20theistic%20and%20non-theistic%20beliefs%20and%20the%20right%20not%20to%20profess%20or%20practice%20any%20religion%2C%E2%80%9D%20the%20law%20was%20revised%20to%20read.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EThat%20law%20extended%20important%20new%20protections%20to%20atheists.%20Still%2C%20as%20Gray%20might%20have%20predicted%2C%20it%20is%20difficult%2C%20in%20this%20particular%20political%20moment%2C%20to%20believe%20that%20the%20circle%20of%20rights%20is%20expanding%20for%20atheists%20or%20for%20anyone%20else.%20Moore%20and%20Kramnick%2C%20who%20have%20written%20a%20thorough%20and%20useful%20history%20of%20the%20legal%20and%20political%20status%20of%20atheists%20in%20America%2C%20unsurprisingly%20believe%20that%20such%20work%20is%20salvific%E2%80%94that%20understanding%20the%20bias%20against%20atheists%20in%20the%20past%20can%20help%20end%20it%20in%20the%20future.%20Gray%20holds%20no%20such%20hope%2C%20and%20yet%20his%20book%20offers%20a%20way%20forward.%20In%20it%2C%20he%20helps%20us%20understand%20how%20those%20who%20do%20not%20believe%20in%20God%2C%20or%2C%20for%20that%20matter%2C%20those%20who%20do%2C%20have%20oriented%20themselves%20in%20the%20universe.%20Faith%2C%20after%20all%2C%20drove%20the%20Puritans%20to%20Plymouth%20Rock%20but%20then%20led%20them%20to%20execute%20three%20of%20their%20Quaker%20neighbors%3B%20it%20inspired%20American%20slavers%20but%20also%20American%20abolitionists%3B%20and%2C%20whatever%20else%20atheism%20is%20accused%20of%20doing%20in%20this%20country%2C%20it%20sustained%20the%20scientific%20curiosity%20and%20profound%20pacifism%20of%20the%20two-time%20Nobel%20Prize%20winner%20Linus%20Pauling%2C%20the%20philanthropy%20of%20Andrew%20Carnegie%2C%20and%20the%20art%20and%20activism%20of%20Lorraine%20Hansberry.%20All%20of%20us%2C%20nihilists%20included%2C%20believe%20something%E2%80%94many%20things%2C%20in%20fact%2C%20about%20ourselves%2C%20the%20cosmos%2C%20and%20one%20another.%20In%20the%20end%2C%20the%20most%20interesting%20thing%20about%20a%20conscience%20is%20how%20it%20answers%2C%20not%20whom%20it%20answers%20to.%C2%A0%E2%99%A6%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%22%7D","ref":""},["p","Cosmologies, in other words, can make for strange bedfellows, and some of what Gray does best in “Seven Types of Atheism” is not only to draw distinctions among atheists but to make connections between nonbelievers and believers. Christians ignorant of their own history, for instance, will be surprised to learn that their earliest ancestors in the faith were themselves ridiculed as “atheists” because they refused to participate in polytheistic worship: in Greek, ",["em","atheos"]," means “without gods,” not anti-God. Meanwhile, those who came to atheism via the new atheists might be startled to find that many of their intellectual forebears did not wage war on religion, or even feel any distaste for it."],["p","In fairness, contemporary American atheists may be inclined to wage war on religion because religion has been waging war on them for so long. A brief truce was reached at the end of the Obama Administration, when Congress passed, and the President signed, a new version of the International Religious Freedom Act that officially included nonbelievers. “The freedom of thought, conscience, and religion is understood to protect theistic and non-theistic beliefs and the right not to profess or practice any religion,” the law was revised to read."],["p","That law extended important new protections to atheists. Still, as Gray might have predicted, it is difficult, in this particular political moment, to believe that the circle of rights is expanding for atheists or for anyone else. Moore and Kramnick, who have written a thorough and useful history of the legal and political status of atheists in America, unsurprisingly believe that such work is salvific—that understanding the bias against atheists in the past can help end it in the future. Gray holds no such hope, and yet his book offers a way forward. In it, he helps us understand how those who do not believe in God, or, for that matter, those who do, have oriented themselves in the universe. Faith, after all, drove the Puritans to Plymouth Rock but then led them to execute three of their Quaker neighbors; it inspired American slavers but also American abolitionists; and, whatever else atheism is accused of doing in this country, it sustained the scientific curiosity and profound pacifism of the two-time Nobel Prize winner Linus Pauling, the philanthropy of Andrew Carnegie, and the art and activism of Lorraine Hansberry. All of us, nihilists included, believe something—many things, in fact, about ourselves, the cosmos, and one another. In the end, the most interesting thing about a conscience is how it answers, not whom it answers to. ♦"]]],"canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"sections":[{"id":"59babd482af19b1403458545","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"59babd482af19b1403458545","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Books","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"books"},{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"},{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"}],"name":"Books","parent":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"},"slug":"books"},{"id":"5907ef77019dfc3494e9c911","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Books","parent":[],"photos":{},"slug":"books-tag"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"magazine","contentTags":[],"contentType":"article","contributors":[{"name":"Casey Cep","type":"author","title":"Casey Cep is a writer from the Eastern Shore of Maryland.
