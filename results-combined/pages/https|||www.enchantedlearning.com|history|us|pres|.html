His Vice-President was <a href="/history/us/pres/jefferson" target="_top">Thomas  Jefferson</a>. John Adams was born in Quincy, <a href="/usa/states/massachusetts/" target="_top">Massachusetts</a>, on October 30, 1735. His father was a farmer. Adams graduated from Harvard University in 1755, and went on to become a lawyer in Boston.
<p> Adams was a delegate to both the First and Second Continental Congresses, and helped draft the Declaration of Independence. After the Revolution, in 1783, Adams went to France to sign the Treaty of Paris, and became the first US ambassador to Great Britain, from 1785 to 1788 (this was a very difficult position, since the British were not pleased with the outcome of the war).

His Vice-President was John Calhoun.  As President, Adams' political party was "National Republican."  John Quincy Adams' father, <a href="/history/us/pres/adams" target="_top">John Adams</a>, was the second president of the United States.
<p>
John Quincy Adams was born in Quincy, Massachusetts, on July 11, 1767. Adams graduated from Harvard University in 1787, went on to become a lawyer in Boston, and was elected senator from Massachusetts in 1803.  President James Madison appointed Adams Minister to the Netherlands and later, Russia.  Adams helped negotiate the treaty that ended the War of 1812 (which was fought with Britain).  Adams then became Madison's Secretary of State.  He later negotiated the treaty with Canada that placed the border west of the Great Lakes at the 49th parallel. He then negotiated with Spain, obtaining a treaty that returned <a href="/usa/states/florida/" target="_top">Florida</a> to the USA.  Adams also helped draft the Monroe Doctrine, which ended European colonization of the Americas.
</p><p>
After winning the presidency in 1824 (beating Andrew Jackson), Adams' term included prosperity and road and canal building (including the Erie Canal, which connected New York City and the <a href="/usa/statesbw/greatlakes.shtml" target="_top">Great Lakes</a>).  Adams lost the next presidential election (Jackson won).  Adams then served in the House of Representatives until his death (1831 until 1848).</p></td>

Before he was President, Arthur had been the Vice-President of the USA, serving under President James A. Garfield.  After Garfield was assassinated, Arthur became President.   During his term as President, he tried to reform the civil service system.  Early in his career, Arthur worked as a lawyer and as the customs collector for the Port of New York City (but Arthur was ousted from that office for doing political favors for his party supporters).</td>

Educated as a lawyer, Buchanan had worked as a Pennsylvania state legislator, Representative, minister to Russia, US Senator, Secretary of State (to President James K. Polk), and minister to Great Britain.  After he was elected President, Buchanan fought to preserve the Union (the North and the South were heading towards war over the issue of slavery).  Although he was against slavery, Buchanan let Kansas (a slave state) join the Union - this angered the anti-slavery North.  Buchanan's support of the outcome of the Dred Scott court case (in which it was ruled that Scott, a black man could not obtain his freedom because he was not a US citizen) also decreased support in the North.  Lincoln became President in 1861 after Buchanan left office.</td>

Carter's achievements included creating a new Department of Energy, and negotiating the 1979 Camp David Agreement. Sixty-three Americans were taken hostage in Iran during Carter's term; this crisis together with stagflation (rising prices with stagnant wages), his boycotting the Olympics, and the gas crisis made Carter's popularity decline.

Fillmore was Vice President under Zachary Taylor, but became president after Taylor died in office. Although Fillmore was against slavery, he approved of the Compromise of 1850, which allowed more new slave states to be entered into the Union and harshly penalized people who helped runaway slaves; because of this, Fillmore lost much of his support from the North. One of Fillmore's achievements was opening up trade with Japan (Fillmore sent Commodore Matthew Perry to Japan).

Ford is the only president who wasn't elected to the office of President or Vice-President (he served as President from 1974 to 1977).

A month later, Ford pardoned Nixon for any crimes he might have committed while in office; many Americans were upset over this decision, but Ford wanted to help the country get over the trauma of Nixon's Watergate scandal.

Wilson was a college professor, college president, and governor of <a href="/usa/states/newjersey/" target="_top">New Jersey</a> before becoming president. During Wilson's two presidential terms (1913-1921) he tried to keep America out of World War I (Wilson was re-elected using the slogan "He kept us out of war"), but he eventually declared war on Germany. Wilson founded the League of Nations (it was an organization that was devoted to maintaining world peace, but was proven to be a failure when World War II began in the 1930s).  Wilson suffered a stroke in late 1919, and was an invalid for the rest of his term. Wilson died on February 3, 1924, in Washington, D.C.</td>
