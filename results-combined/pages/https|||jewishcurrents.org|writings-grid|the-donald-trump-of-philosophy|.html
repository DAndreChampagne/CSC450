<p><em>Discussed in this essay: </em>The Genius of Judaism<em> by Bernard-Henri Lévy. Random House, 2017, 256 pages.
<br /></em></p>

<p><strong>WHEN BERNARD-HENRI</strong> Lévy burst onto the philosophical scene in the late 1970s as the leading voice of repentant young leftists known as the New Philosophers, the phenomenon was something of a mystery here in the U.S. Anti-communism and anti-Marxism were hardly novel or daring notions here, not even from former militants. We had long since had our Louis Budenz, Whittaker Chambers, and James Burnham, so there was really nothing all that striking about fallen Maoists like Lévy, André Glucksmann, or Christian Jambet and their anti-communist jeremiads. Even in France, there was a long tradition of anti-communism and anti-Marxism, and of much higher a level than our own, or indeed that of the New Philosophers. Cornelius Castoriadis, Boris Souvarine, Victor Serge, Raymond Aron, all acutely analyzed and critiqued both Soviet communism and Marxism. They did so minus the bombast and the media support of the new group, and they were by any measure vastly superior to the New Philosophers, who were benefiting from the backlash against May '68, the Chinese Cultural Revolution, and the ossification of the Soviet Union.</p>

<p>Despite his initial lionization, Lévy has often been the butt of ridicule that he has brought upon himself. Travelling to Afghanistan and dressing himself up as a <em>mujahid</em>, he wrote about the war there, unstintingly praising the Islamist warlords fighting the Soviets. His book <em>L’Idéologie Française</em>, which placed antisemitism at the heart of much of French political and intellectual life, was pilloried for its abuse of the conclusions of the great Israeli historian of the French far right, Ze’ev Sternhell, whose books he cribbed from mercilessly. Lévy's foray into filmmaking, the pompous and empty <em>Le Jour et la Nuit,</em> was one of the worst-received films in French film history and was declared by the <em>Cahiers du</em> <em>Cinéma</em> to be the worst film produced in France since World War II. Lévy also covered himself in ridicule when, in his typically omniscient fashion, he cited the philosopher Jean-Christophe Botul’s lectures in Paraguay on Kant in his 2010 <em>De la Guerre</em> <em>en Philosophie</em>. Botul, unfortunately for Lévy, was a fictional philosopher invented by Frédéric Pagès, created to mock the pomposity of actual philosophers, like Lévy.</p>

<p>Yet despite the mockery, he has remained an important presence in French life, advising politicians and omnipresent in the media. Now, decades beyond his sell-by date, he has produced his second book dedicated to Judaism, <em>The Genius of Judaism</em>, a book so devoid of any intellectual value, so full of itself, that it leaves the reader stupefied.</p>

<p>Pierre-Vidal Naquet, the great historian of the classical world, one of the true heroes of post-World War II French political life, a man who courageously defended the Algerian cause and put his life at risk condemning French use of torture during the Algerian War, asked, after reading Lévy’s previous book on Judaism, <em>Le Testament de Dieu</em>: “How can a graduate of the Ecole Normale, with an advanced degree in philosophy… show such contempt for himself and his readers as to inflict such a ‘science’ on them?”</p>

<p>These words are not harsh enough for <em>The Genius of Judaism</em>.</p>

<p>Even Garrison Keillor saw fit to go after Lévy. He famously skewered Lévy’s book on America, <em>American Vertigo</em>, saying that Lévy “is a French writer with a spatter-paint prose style and the grandiosity of a college sophomore.” Though these words were written over a decade ago, in <em>The Genius of Judaism</em>, sophomoric is still as high as he can reach.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>UNSUBSTANTIATED</strong>, erroneous, or simply hallucinatory assertions and interpretations flow ceaselessly through the pages of the book. The easiest fish to shoot in this barrel are his observations about America. According to Lévy “there were pogroms organized by black racists in Boston and, in August 1991, in Crown Heights, Brooklyn.” I have no recollection of any pogrom in Boston, and have found no mention of one anywhere, so perhaps Lévy can enlighten us as to when it occurred. As for the events in Crown Heights, they were, in the first case, not a pogrom, which is a word Lévy uses all too lightly: no Black Hundreds stormed down Eastern Parkway. Nor, in fact, was it organized. It broke out after two black children were struck by a hasidic driver and word quickly spread that the Hatzoloh ambulance on the scene had left the black children, one of whom died, while taking the Jewish driver of the fatal vehicle to the hospital. The ugliness of the three days of rioting cannot be denied (I, in fact, worked at the time in the hospital where the Yankel Rosenbaum died when the resident physicians who treated him failed to notice stab wounds in his back, so I know saw just how bad it was), but to compare what happened in Crown Heights to Kishinev is an abuse of language.</p>

<p>Lévy also tirelessly and tiresomely hammers away at the presence of Holocaust denial here -- a marginal presence at best -- and misleadingly uses the present tense when writing that the “United States has the dubious privilege of hosting the Institute for Historical Review,” the center of Holocaust denial that imploded several years ago and exists as a mere rump organization, lacking the means to publish a journal or host international conferences.</p>

<p>It goes without saying that for Lévy the crimes and misdeeds of the BDS movement are proof of the evil eating away at America, bending our country’s life to its will. In fact, it is a movement that one could only wish had the power Lévy grants it. That thirteen states have bills banning it, that the Senate has passed a clearly unconstitutional law -– under cover of attacking antisemitism -– banning anti-Israeli speech and activities like BDS, are unknown to M. Lévy. To top it off, based on a statistical sample of a handful of conversations, he believes that Americans are clamoring for an end to U.S. support for Israel. Ever the condescending know-it-all, Lévy feels obliged to remind our misguided selves “that the country might have a strategic interest in defending the island of stability in the Middle East that is Israel.” As if the overwhelming majority of politicians, commentators, and people in America don’t feel the same -- and as if this defense of Israel were something novel.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>RASHI</strong>, the medieval French sage, is honored for, “ennobling the French language and making possible, a century later, the Perceval and Lancelot of an author whose first name was Christian but who was probably Jewish.” Rashi, I need not remind readers, wrote in Hebrew, but  “ennobled” French by including terms current in the French of the 12th century in his commentaries -- and so was, says Lévy, was a source of French literature, although Rashi wrote in a language that few of his countrymen could have read. As for the “Christian” in question, the writer Chrétien de Troyes, Lévy says he was likely a Jew because his name once appears as “Chretien li Gois,” which Levy accepts as meaning “the goy,” <em>i.e.,</em> a convert (don’t ask me about the supposed the connection between goy and convert), but which is more likely a variant spelling of a town in the region. Chrétien would have been a strange Jew, having described Jews in his <em>Grail</em> as “criminals who should be killed like dogs.” <em>The Genius of Judaism</em> has no footnotes, however, so we are left wondering which “whole school of medievalists … asserted he was a member of the powerful Jewish community of Troyes.” Certainly many converts have surrendered to antisemitism, but it takes quite a refined mind to then turn the antisemitic convert into a Jewish courier of a nation’s culture.</p>

<p>Let us not omit Lévy's insistence that the source of the French republic was not the inspiration of the Romans and the Greeks, but rather the Hebrew Bible, a claim that Lévy bases on the writings of a couple of minor figures whole ignoring the omnipresence of Roman ideals, characters, images, and even names among the men of the French Revolution. For Lévy, in his fantastic universe, the occultation of the Hebrew roots of the Republic was nothing but “deceit, carried out by every light of French republicanism, be they Gambetta, De Gaulle, or the Jew Mendes France.” One can only wonder if Lévy, for all his vaporing, ever read the Bible -- for a man who can assert that the ancient Hebrews set the French a “calmer and gentler” example than the Greco-Romans has missed huge chunks of the catalogue of slaughters that is the Hebrew Bible.</p>

<p>In his attempt to salvage his absurd idea of the Jewish Biblical roots of French politics, he speaks of how the French royal houses “never ceased to affirm their kinship with David.” Is Lévy not aware that Jesus is supposed to have descended from David? When Kings Clovis and Pepin traced their roots to David, it was not to boast of Jewish ties or out of philosemitism, but rather to connect themselves to the royal blood that flowed in Jesus’ veins.</p>

<p>Lévy’s twisted vision of French history even has him attacking Napoleon I for assembling the Great Sanhedrin, where, as he puts it, Napoleon, “has the nerve to ask the seventy-one rabbis and Jewish notables…if the law of the republic is compatible with theirs.” There is certainly an ambiguity in this, but it was done to finally put to rest any lingering suspicions about the newly emancipated Jews. That Bonaparte emancipated the Jews in every country he conquered doesn’t fit Lévy’s narrative, so it is omitted.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>I COULD CONTINUE</strong> almost endlessly, and a thorough critique of everything wrong in <em>The</em> <em>Genius of Judaism</em> would require a book as long as the original. There’s a dubious statement on almost every page.</p>

<p>In his chapter on “How Modern Judaism Abolished the Idea of Revolution,” he presents the Jews and philosemites among his fellow New Philosophers as proof that Jews and Judaism put an end to the foolish messianism of revolution. But for every Glucksmann, Lévy and Finkielkraut, there is an Alain Krivine or Daniel Cohn-Bendit who has stayed the course. He quotes Michel Foucault as saying in 1977, “You know that it is the very desirability of revolution that is the problem today… [i]n the form that we desired it, it has become an impossibility; in the form that turned out to be possible in China and Cambodia it is no longer desirable.” Conveniently omitted is any mention of the fact that within a year Foucault would famously support the Iranian revolution of Khomeini.</p>

<p>Lévy dishonorably attempts to enlist for his religious cause the uncompromising revolutionary Pierre Goldman, who Lévy asserts was returning to Judaism at the time of his assassination in 1979, when in fact he never ceased being a Jew. What return is needed for a man who titled his autobiography <em>Dim Memories of a Polish Jew Born in </em>France? Lévy also speaks dishonestly of how the former leader of French Maoism Robert Linhart “chose” silence. He “chose” silence if a mutism resulting from having gone mad is a choice.</p>

<p>That Lévy is acting in bad faith is proved in large ways and small. His insistence that Proust’s writing is “kabbalistic” is so divorced from reality as to be worrisome. That Proust's prose is complex and ornate is undeniable, but it is utterly gratuitous to tack the word “kabbalistic” on to it. As proof of the influence –- not of his Jewishness, which is undeniable, but of Judaism on Proust’s masterpiece -- Lévy quotes a letter from the rabid Jew-hater and Proust’s competitor as France’s great 20<sup>th</sup> century writer, Louis-Ferdinand Céline, who asserted that <em>In Search of Lost Time</em> “is ‘designed’ and ‘built’ like a Talmud.” Céline hated Proust’s writing, and his Jew-hatred was so severe that he even insisted the pope was really a Dutch Jew. Hating Proust, there could be no worse curse he could find for him than to describe his writing as Talmudic, hence nonsensical. Playing fast and loose with his sources, as Lévy is so often wont, he omits this little caveat.</p>

<p>Perhaps most egregiously, Lévy writes that “in all of the world’s democracies, there is a limit condition that, when encountered, appears to cause them to lean toward declaring a state of emergency… That limit… is war.” In Israel, on the other hand, “[f]reedom of opinion and assembly [are] scrupulously respected even in time of war.” In this case only one word is possible to describe Lévy, and that’s <em>khutspe</em>. Lévy is a vocal defender of the state of emergency in France that, among other things, bans demonstrations. He advocates it, and then mocks France for not being like Israel, which has not imposed such a ban (at least for Jews). He is the boy who kills his parents and then asks for mercy since he’s an orphan.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>LEVY IDEALIZES</strong> Israel, and after speaking of the failures of assimilation in the U.S. and France dares to say that “I know a country that has found a solution to the problem of multiethnicity, not a perfect solution but better than in France or the United States.” The answer, of course, for Lévy is Israel, “where citizens of Arab origin may openly advocate the disappearance of the very state that guarantees them a life that three quarters of them… would not trade at any price for a life in a neighboring state.” Does Lévy truly believe that Israeli Arabs are anything but second-class citizens? And why travel to Israel to find a successful multi-ethnic state? Why does no one ever mention Canada, where for several years the official opposition party was the Parti Québécois, which had as its goal Quebec’s separation from Canada? Canada, which, with little opposition and great warmth, has welcomed refugees from Syria and Iraq.</p>

<p>I’ve not even begun to critique the religious section of this book, full of pretentious folderol from a man who neither reads Hebrew nor is a practicing Jew. It is little but bombast and self-promotion. Indeed, <em>The Genius of Judaism</em> is the work of a man lost in love for his own voice, for his own self, whose media success has enabled him to delude himself that he has something valid to say and, even more, is a providential figure to whom the world needs to pay heed. If the words “I” and “me” were erased from his vocabulary he would be reduced to silence. He is the Donald Trump of philosophy.</p>

<p>Somewhere in the middle of the book, Lévy makes the absolutely groundless assertion =– one among thousands –- that “I do not know of a single Jew in the world for whom the presence of Israel is not a promise –- perhaps a promise deferred, but a promise nonetheless.” I look forward to the day I meet BHL, so that he will not only know of, but know a Jew for whom Israel is not a promise. If he’d like, I can provide him with a list of Jews of my acquaintance who also deny Israel is a land of promise. Let him speak for and embarrass himself, but leave the mass of Jews out of it.</p>

For most, it is remembered as a story about the limits of free speech, centered on a legal battle between the ACLU-represented National Socialist Party of America and Skokie village officials who sought to defend the town&amp;rsquo;s multitude of Holocaust survivors. Anyone vaguely familiar with the incident knows the Nazis marched in Illinois; the event even inspired a famous scene in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;The Blues Brothers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt; in which the duo runs a group of demonstrating &amp;ldquo;Illinois Nazis&amp;rdquo; off a bridge. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;But the Nazi march at the center of the famous legal case never happened. Though the Nazis finally won the right to demonstrate in Skokie after a long legal battle, the Nazis canceled just days before the proposed demonstration. For most who know of the incident, that&amp;rsquo;s the end of the story. But the Nazis weren&amp;rsquo;t done, and the Swastika War (as it was dubbed in the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;Chicago Tribune&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;) culminated in a different march altogether&amp;mdash;and a second First Amendment case involving protestors who defied police orders to sit back and let the Nazis demonstrate.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;The full story of the Swastika War can&amp;rsquo;t be reduced to any courtroom drama, nor is it confined to a conflict between neo-Nazis and the Jewish community. Archival documentation tells a more complex story of massive counter-demonstrations, black and Jewish solidarity, Holocaust survivors who vowed to confront the Nazis in the streets, and a grassroots battle between a small collective of proud, leftist Jews and the conservative institutional leadership of the Jewish community. This untold history reveals a minority of the Jewish community in revolt&amp;mdash;clear-eyed about their allies and determined to confront the Nazis directly, despite repression on the part of both the mainstream Jewish community and the police. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&amp;ldquo;A CLOSED SOCIETY&amp;rdquo;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;Seen in its full scope, the Swastika War begins like too many American stories: in the rubble of anti-black racism. In Marquette Park, the &amp;ldquo;Nazi neighborhood&amp;rdquo; on the southwest side of Chicago, the rubble was piling up, and by 1976 it would topple over into the Jewish community in the village of Skokie. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;Marquette Park, the white, largely Lithuanian neighborhood that Frank Collin&amp;rsquo;s National Socialist Party of America called home, was a historic epicenter of anti-black violence. By the mid-60s, a decade after the Montgomery Bus Boycott, civil rights had still not come to Chicago. Entire neighborhoods and a public park were kept whites-only by housing discrimination, hostile white residents, and complicit police. Western Avenue divided the nearly all-white Marquette Park from all-black West Englewood. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;In 1966, Martin Luther King Jr. was struck by a rock in Marquette Park while protesting these racist housing policies with the Chicago Freedom Movement, in a campaign organized by his Southern Christian Leadership Conference. &amp;ldquo;I have been in many demonstrations all across the South, but I can say that I have never seen&amp;mdash;even in Mississippi and Alabama&amp;mdash;mobs as hostile and as hate-filled as I've seen in Chicago,&amp;rdquo; King said at the time. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s definitely a closed society,&amp;rdquo; he said of the area. &amp;ldquo;[W]e&amp;rsquo;re going to make it an open society.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;A decade later, this promise was profoundly unfulfilled. In 1976, United Press International (UPI) published a series of stories investigating racist housing practices in Marquette Park. A batch of homes on the eastern edge of Marquette Park were now black owned. The white neighbors greeted them with terror. &amp;ldquo;More than 50 black families were harassed with firebombs, broken windows, threats and abuse,&amp;rdquo; UPI reported. The &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;Chicago Defender&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;, a black newspaper, reported that &amp;ldquo;in a year and a half of incidents, black residents have had swastikas and threatening signs painted on their property,&amp;rdquo; and many homes were subject to &amp;ldquo;fire damage by apparent arsonists.&amp;rdquo; Investigations stalled; in one case the police would not categorize the fire as arson, instead blaming electrical wires. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;Meanwhile, reports in the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;Chicago Defender&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt; also detailed the violence that awaited black residents who found themselves on the other side of Western Avenue, too close to Marquette Park itself. One man, Robert Ellington, was dragged out of his car and stabbed 22 times by young white men just a few weeks after the firebombings of black homes. The Martin Luther King Jr. Movement and the Chicago Urban League established community patrols to put a stop to the violence, while the Nation of Islam donated food and clothing to the fire victims. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;Some in the community believed Collin&amp;rsquo;s group of self-proclaimed Nazis were behind the violence, particularly the firebombings. That year, the Martin Luther King Jr. Movement Coalition declared they would march into Marquette Park in protest. The group of 100 civil rights marchers were met by a white mob of 2,500 and far less police protection than they anticipated. Phyllis Hudson, a reporter for the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;Chicago Defender&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;, was struck in the back with a brick. Black people who drove by during the demonstration became targets of white violence; when Wendell Kells crashed into a stop sign, his car was pummelled by bricks and bottles, and his cousin Thornton was knocked unconscious. Kells told the reporters he thought the mob would kill his cousin. More than 30 were reported injured. Sixty-three were arrested. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;Suspicions of Nazi responsibility for these attacks added to their already violent reputation. In the summer of 1976, the Chicago Park District put a stop to the Nazis&amp;rsquo; frequent rallies in Marquette Park, citing their violent outcomes. To demonstrate in a public park, the Nazis would have to put up a $250,000 insurance bond as a liability against property damage. Unable to come up with the money, the Nazis cancelled their demonstrations and sought legal representation from the American Civil Liberties Union. They also applied for permits to demonstrate in other areas outside of Chicago&amp;rsquo;s limits. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;This is how the Nazi problem in Marquette Park spread to suburbia, while the racist attacks within the city bore on. The firebombings of black homes (or, in one case, the home of a white resident who had recently sold to a black buyer) continued into the summer of 1977.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;The nearby town of Skokie was in most ways a typical Chicago suburb&amp;mdash;its development and demographics structured in part by American racism, especially white flight from the interior of the city. Skokie&amp;rsquo;s demographics were also influenced by European antisemitism. By the mid-1970s, out of a total population of 70,000, Skokie had a rapidly growing Jewish community, which Marvin Bailey, the village&amp;rsquo;s director of housing development estimated at approximately 40,000 people. Though most arrived in Skokie from communities on Chicago&amp;rsquo;s South and West sides in response to an in-migration of blacks from the South, a significant amount Skokie&amp;rsquo;s Jews&amp;mdash;between 5,000 and 6,000 people&amp;mdash;were refugees and survivors of the Holocaust and their families. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;Frank Collin, the Nazi party leader, seized upon this migration pattern and turned it on its head. In press releases he blamed Jews for the &amp;ldquo;invasion&amp;rdquo; of black people on the city&amp;rsquo;s southwest side, connecting his racist and anti-Jewish agendas.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;As the Nazis searched for march locations devoid of the city of Chicago&amp;rsquo;s large bond requirement, they fixed their eyes on Skokie. When the Village of Skokie denied the Nazis&amp;rsquo; request for a marching permit and introduced restrictive amendments to their constitution, the ACLU famously took the village to court. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;CONFRONTING HATRED&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;After a long legal battle, by the summer of 1978 it was likely that the Nazis would get a permit to demonstrate in Skokie. For the radicals in the Jewish community of Skokie and elsewhere, it seemed increasingly clear that if the US Constitution could not keep the Nazis out, they had to be challenged in the street. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;More than a year of national media coverage of the Nazis&amp;rsquo; legal case and the dramatic nature of the story created a whirlwind. Many Jews abandoned the ACLU in disgust over their defense of the Nazis&amp;rsquo; right to a permit. The NAACP, Jesse Jackson and other civil rights leaders and organizations guaranteed their presence. A massive counter-demonstration was brewing. The Jewish Federation of Metropolitan Chicago anticipated 50,000 people in Skokie on June 25th to oppose what might amount to several dozen Nazis, and militant groups like the right-wing Jewish Defense League (JDL) promised violence. While the ACLU was defending the Nazis&amp;rsquo; legal right to march into the Jewish suburb, they were also giving them the right to march into an incredibly dangerous situation. Alarmed by the possibility of violence, Skokie village officials, in conversation with mainstream Jewish organizations, devised a plan which would protect the Nazis if they were to march.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;Their plan called for a separate counter-demonstration, far from the Nazis. Instead of confronting them directly, they proposed that approximately 100 community leaders and officials would face the Nazis at Skokie Village Hall, while a mile away the massive counter-demonstration would take place out of sight. The logic of the separate counter-demonstration was documented in the legal case that the Village of Skokie built against the Nazis. The sight of Nazis in their uniforms, they argued, would elicit an uncontrollable and even violent reaction, especially in Holocaust survivors. Separating the Nazis from the crowd wasn&amp;rsquo;t for the protection of the survivors from the Nazis, but actually the other way around. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;For their part, the counter-demonstrators were split: One faction insisted that if the Nazis were going to be in Skokie, they had to confront them directly. Others, including the Jewish Federation of Metropolitan Chicago, disagreed. A fascinating record of the debate over the separate march and the strategies to confront the Nazis comes from a forgotten source, the Chutzpah Jewish Liberation Collective, and their underground newspaper, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;Chutzpah&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;Founded in 1971, this small, charismatic group of Jewish leftists demonstrated together and published a newspaper articulating a holistic vision of Jewish liberation that rejected the sectarianism of their ultra-leftist peers and the right-wing Zionism of the JDL. Unlike much of the mainstream Jewish community, Chutzpah wasn&amp;rsquo;t outraged at the ACLU. They were outraged with the Jewish Federation of Metropolitan Chicago and the village officials in Skokie over the plan for a separate march. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;figure class=\"aligncenter\"&gt;&lt;img title=\"skokie flyer\" src=\"https://www.datocms-assets.com/4857/1541617861-join-us-in-skokie.jpg\" alt=\"skokie flyer\" width=\"650\" height=\"730\" /&gt;\n&lt;figcaption&gt;Flyer made by the Chutzpah Collective criticizing the Jewish Federation's separate counter-demonstration to the Nazi march in Skokie. Reproduced from the personal collection of Miriam Socoloff.&lt;/figcaption&gt;\n&lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;They printed flyers featuring a fist smashing a swastika&amp;mdash;an image lifted from the Jewish Resistance in the Warsaw Ghetto&amp;mdash;urging people to disobey the plan of village officials. They charged the Federation with being concerned that &amp;ldquo;the Jews look respectable for the media,&amp;rdquo; and demanded the right to confront the Nazis at Village Hall on June 25th, rather than &amp;ldquo;cower on the other side of town.&amp;rdquo; Unlike the JDL, they did not advocate violence, but rather said that confrontation was necessary to ensure that if the Nazis marched into the Jewish community, it would be a &amp;ldquo;very unpleasant experience.&amp;rdquo; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;But with days to go, Nazi leader Frank Collin cancelled the Skokie march. Citing precedent, Chicago Federal District Court Judge George Leighton dismissed the insurance bond that had previously kept the Nazis from demonstrating in Chicago public parks. &amp;ldquo;We could go on for a long time with hearings on this matter,&amp;rdquo; he said, &amp;ldquo;but we know from experience in this case that the plaintiff&amp;rsquo;s argument will prevail.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;By winning back the Nazis&amp;rsquo; right to march in Marquette Park, Collin had scored a victory: he avoided a dangerous situation in Skokie while terrorizing thousands of Jewish Holocaust survivors, as well as Jews across the country who had been following the story at a distance. Most importantly, he had secured the right to demonstrate on his &amp;ldquo;home turf&amp;rdquo; without economic consequence. Trumpeting that his free speech was restored, Collin announced that instead of demonstrating in Skokie, the Nazis would go ahead with their rally in Marquette Park on July 9th. For Skokie Mayor Al Smith, this was a decisive victory, bringing the village out of the crosshairs. The Metropolitan Black Caucus called the turn of events a &amp;ldquo;conspiracy&amp;rdquo; to endanger the the black community, while ensuring safety in the Jewish community. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;The Jewish Federation of Metropolitan Chicago called off the counter-demonstration in Skokie and they did not organize one for Marquette Park. For some Holocaust survivors, the fact that the Nazis were marching elsewhere was no consolation. One survivor, who preferred to remain anonymous, explained his profound disappointment with the whole affair, and especially the penning off of the counter-protest, to the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;Chicago Tribune&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;I feel let down by the American people, the Jewish people. No one came out and said &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;we have a right to march and face them, if we felt we must. Our stand was that we had&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;to confront the Nazis. The officials felt the separate countermarch was easier for them. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;But after what we went through in the Holocaust, why did we not get some support for o&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;ur feelings?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;figure class=\"aligncenter\"&gt;&lt;img title=\"chutzpah members\" src=\"https://www.datocms-assets.com/4857/1541617868-chutzpahmembers.jpg\" alt=\"chutzpah members\" width=\"650\" height=\"454\" /&gt;\n&lt;figcaption&gt;Members of the Chutzpah Jewish Liberation Collective, 1977.

Chutzpah wanted people who were threatened by Nazis to unite in opposition, namely blacks, gays, socialists, and Jews. They were joined by the Tim Berry Irish Republican Clubs, the International Socialists, and the North Side chapter of the New American Movement, among others. The groups that joined Chutzpah to form the coalition agreed at the outset that they would not use the anti-Nazi demonstration in Skokie as a forum for anti-Israel politics. While Chutzpah was a non-Zionist group, their members were wary of those on the left who reduced Jewish issues to Israel and Zionism. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;&amp;ldquo;Building a Coalition,&amp;rdquo; an article in the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;Chutzpah&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt; newspaper, described meetings where organizers ran into pushback over its Jewish context. One leftist, who was Jewish himself, argued that to root the coalition in a Jewish context was reactionary, and that instead they should choose a name from the anti-apartheid struggle in South Africa. Chutzpah members disagreed, believing that a group which was founded to oppose Nazis in Skokie could very well call itself something Jewish. After some more arguing, the diverse and multiracial group came to an agreement. They called themselves the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising Coalition. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;The upcoming march put Chutzpah into relationship not just with other leftist organizations, but even with elements of the Jewish far right: the JDL was also planning on countering the Nazi march on July 9th. And while they were not part of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising Coalition, the JDL was involved in a speaking event at a church in the black community of West Englewood the day before the Nazi rally in Marquette Park, and also attended the counter-demonstration itself. This is noteworthy because the JDL, ostensibly founded to protect older Jews in New York City against black crime, was known to feed off anti-black fear in the Jewish community. However, their radical opposition to Nazism brought them into solidarity with Chutzpah and other leftists who supported black community members&amp;rsquo; struggle against the Nazis in their neighborhood.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;The day of the march, 2,000 anti-Nazi demonstrators gathered, but quickly realized that the police would not allow them directly into the white community on the other side of the train tracks. So instead, they altered their path, and decided to take a longer route through the embattled West Englewood neighborhood in solidarity with its black residents. In the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;Chutzpah&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt; newspaper, activist Jerry Herst described the march: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;It was really a heterogeneous march. Banners identified groups from all over the country. There were Blacks with signs against Nazism and anti-Semitism, young people joining from the neighborhood, older adults from the Grey Panthers and the Emma Lazarus Clubs, college students, gentiles against anti-Semitism, whites against racism. Some came from highly organized sectarian leftist organizations, while other individuals just came because they felt strongly about the issue.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;People came from their houses to wave at the demonstrators, cars honked their horns in approval. Children ran into the march, eager to try out the organizers&amp;rsquo; bullhorns. It &amp;ldquo;was the most fun we had all day,&amp;rdquo; Herst wrote. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;figure class=\"aligncenter\"&gt;&lt;img title=\"uprising\" src=\"https://www.datocms-assets.com/4857/1541617855-warsawuprising.jpg\" alt=\"uprising\" width=\"650\" height=\"405\" /&gt;\n&lt;figcaption&gt;The Warsaw Ghetto Uprising Coalition at a counter-demonstration to the Nazi march in Marquette Park, Chicago. Photo: Marian Henriquez Neudel&lt;/figcaption&gt;\n&lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;When counter-protestors arrived at Western Avenue, where the train tracks divided West Englewood and Marquette Park, the march was halted by the police. &amp;ldquo;Free speech for anti-Nazis! Let&amp;rsquo;s go to the park!&amp;rdquo; The protestors&amp;rsquo; shouts echoed under a viaduct. Close by, skirmishes broke out between Nazi sympathizers and the anti-Nazis. Not everyone was blocked; some managed to talk or push their way into Marquette Park. By the time Jerry Herst arrived, the rally was mostly over. He found a Holocaust survivor who was shaken by the familiar hatred he witnessed in the park. As Jerry turned back through the chaos, &amp;ldquo;past knots of white power T-shirters standing outside bars, past the Nazi storefront, past dozens of police on Western Ave.,&amp;rdquo; he reflected, &amp;ldquo;I finally felt safe again, back in the Black ghetto. That feeling of safety there is one I hope not ever to forget.&amp;rdquo; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;Marian Henriquez Neudel, also a member of Chutzpah and a legal observer, wasn&amp;rsquo;t as lucky. She and her friends Andrew Klein and Theo Katzman were among the 21 people arrested that day. Neudel, Klein, and Katzman&amp;mdash;all members of the Upstairs Minyan which met at the University of Chicago Hillel&amp;mdash;were arrested &amp;ldquo;for their own safety&amp;rdquo; after trying to cross Western Avenue towards the Nazis a second time. In the paddy wagon they were joined by a black counter-demonstrator and a &amp;ldquo;psychotic Nazi.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m not using either of those two words loosely. He believed he was Jesus and the Jews were sent to kill him,&amp;rdquo; Neudel told me in an interview. &amp;ldquo;Then he played Harry Houdini and managed to get his handcuffed arms in front of him. He started banging his arms against the walls of the car for hours.&amp;rdquo; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;Along with six other members of Chutzpah who had not been allowed into Marquette Park to protest against the Nazis, Neudel, Klein, and Katzman became the plaintiffs in a second case connected to the Swastika War involving Nazi demonstrations, Jews, and the ACLU. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;The plaintiffs in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;Neudel vs. Pepp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt; were represented by Steven Lubet, himself a member of Chutzpah, along with Mark Schoenfeld from the Northwestern University Law Clinic and Lois Lipton from the ACLU. Together, they sued Charles Pepp, Deputy Chief of the Chicago Police Department, as well as Captain William Woods and two commanders, for $25,000 each, claiming that their First Amendment rights had been violated by the police when they were kept from demonstrating in Marquette Park. In a fascinating inversion of the infamous Skokie case, the group made the case that as Jews, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;not&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt; being allowed to counter-demonstrate against the Nazis caused them emotional distress. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;In a way, things had come full circle. The plaintiffs received an out-of-court settlement, for amounts ranging from $200 to $400. &amp;ldquo;Chicago Cops Support Chutzpah!&amp;rdquo; the collective announced in the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;Chutzpah&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt; newspaper. They reported that the plaintiffs pooled money from the settlement to donate $1,300, splitting the amount between the Simon Wiesenthal Jewish Documentation Center, the Fred Hampton Scholarship Fund, and the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;Chutzpah&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt; newspaper itself, to fight Nazism, racism and antisemitism. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;FREEDOM FOR ALL&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;In 2009, the Illinois Holocaust Museum and Education Center opened in Skokie, the result of 30 years of Holocaust education advocacy fueled by the attempted Nazi march. At the very end of the museum, a modest display nods to the would-be Skokie counter-demonstration. A press release under plexiglass detailing the separate march sits alongside protest signs from the JDL. Missing are the voices of dissent who challenged the Jewish establishment in order to confront the Nazis, and the Chutzpah Jewish Liberation Collective&amp;rsquo;s unique organizing history. Most troublingly, the crucial context of anti-black violence, terrorism, segregation, and impoverishment on the southwest side of Chicago is nowhere to be found. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;This story, told in its full scope, bears a lesson not about freedom of speech, but about solidarity forged through common struggle. So long as there is anti-black racism and inequality at the foundation of American society, there will also be Nazi hatred. And wherever this hatred arises it must be confronted by as many people as possible, both systemically and in the streets. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;A sign from the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising Coalition said it best: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;Not in Marquette Park. Not in Skokie. Not Anywhere!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Isaac Brosilow &lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;is a writer and Jewish educator living in Chicago.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","authors":{"id":"228083","name":"Isaac Brosilow","slug":"isaac-brosilow","description":"","itemType":"26697","creator":"8080","meta":{"ctime":"2018-03-20T02:25:49.554Z","mtime":"2018-03-20T02:25:49.559Z","contentType":{"id":"26697","name":"author"},"required":["slug"]}},"categories":{"id":"455560","title":"History","slug":"history","position":37,"parentId":null,"itemType":"26695","creator":"1337","meta":{"ctime":"2018-11-07T19:04:57.021Z","mtime":"2018-11-07T19:04:57.027Z","contentType":{"id":"26695","name":"category"},"required":["title","slug"]}},"themePrimaryColor":null,"featuredPost":false,"featuredImage":{"path":"/4857/1541617653-chutzpahfrontpage.jpg","format":"jpg","size":5997837,"alt":null,"title":null,"width":2486,"height":3317},"thumbnailImage":{"path":"/4857/1541617695-chutzpah-featuedthumb.jpg","format":"jpg","size":2927729,"alt":null,"title":null,"width":2000,"height":1586},"postImage":null,"postImageCaption":"","headerImageCaption":"1978 edition of \"Chutzpah,\" the newspaper of the Chutzpah Jewish Liberation Collective.","tags":[{"id":"234495","title":"Skokie","slug":"skokie","description":"","itemType":"28478","creator":"8080","meta":{"ctime":"2018-03-25T20:10:47.563Z","mtime":"2018-03-25T20:10:47.572Z","contentType":{"id":"28478","name":"tag"},"required":["title","slug"]}},{"id":"241364","title":"Nazis in the U.S.","slug":"nazis-in-the-u-s","description":"","itemType":"28478","creator":"8080","meta":{"ctime":"2018-03-25T21:52:53.485Z","mtime":"2018-03-25T21:52:53.513Z","contentType":{"id":"28478","name":"tag"},"required":["title","slug"]}}],"publishedAt":"2018-11-07T15:30:00-05:00","itemType":"26694","creator":"1337","meta":{"ctime":"2018-11-07T19:02:19.582Z","mtime":"2018-11-07T19:17:33.976Z","contentType":{"id":"26694","name":"post"},"required":["title","slug","content"]}},{"id":"452327","title":"White Nationalism on the Ballot in Brooklyn","slug":"white-nationalism-brooklyn","seoMeta":{"image":{"path":"/4857/1541439119-img0569.JPG","format":"jpg","size":208401,"alt":null,"title":null,"width":888,"height":591},"title":"White Nationalism on the Ballot in Brooklyn","description":"Jews protest state senator Marty Golden for unrenounced ties to white nationalists."},"excerpt":"Jews protest state senator Marty Golden for unrenounced ties to white nationalists.","content":"&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;ON FRIDAY, &lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;50 Jewish and Muslim activists gathered outside the office of Brooklyn State Senator Marty Golden. Some sat on stools and crates as if sitting shiva, others stood holding signs. At their feet, a banner read, &amp;ldquo;Tell white supremacists they don&amp;rsquo;t have a place in your party.&amp;rdquo; And placed on the banner were 11 kippot bearing the names of the 11 Jewish congregants killed at Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh. Together, the assembled recited the Mourner&amp;rsquo;s Kaddish.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;Golden, who&amp;rsquo;s seeking his ninth term as the state senator representing a gerrymandered swath of South Brooklyn, was nowhere to be found. His re-election campaign has become a local microcosm of a national reckoning over the rise of racist nationalism in the United States. Thursday evening, an event featuring his Democratic opponent, Andrew Gounardes, was cancelled when &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/02/nyregion/broad-city-jewish-synagogue-anti-semitism.html\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;antisemitic graffiti&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt; was found in the stairwell of the historic synagogue where the event was to be held. The event&amp;rsquo;s host, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;Broad City&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt; actress Ilana Glazer, told the crowd of attendees outside she didn&amp;rsquo;t feel comfortable ushering 200 people into the enclosed space. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;&amp;ldquo;About 30 seconds before we pulled up, we got a text saying the event was canceled for safety reasons,&amp;rdquo; Gounardes told &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;Jewish Currents&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;. &amp;ldquo;When we arrived, we saw everyone pouring out of the hall.&amp;rdquo; Gounardes went inside to meet his staff and talk to the organizers. &amp;ldquo;The irony is we were coming from a vigil in Bay Ridge for the victims of Pittsburgh and Louisville,&amp;rdquo; Gounardes said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;The action at Golden&amp;rsquo;s office, however, was planned before the words &amp;ldquo;Die Jew Rats&amp;rdquo; were scrawled on the walls of Union Temple. His offices have been a target of protest for weeks, as Golden has refused to fire campaign office manager Ian Reilly, who in October invited Gavin McInnes, leader of the alt-right Proud Boys, to speak at the Metropolitan Republican Club on the Upper East Side. After the McInnes event on October 12, members of the Proud Boys brawled in the streets with antifascist protestors, leading to multiple arrests. McInnes has proudly called himself &amp;ldquo;Islamophobic,&amp;rdquo; warned of &amp;ldquo;war against whites,&amp;rdquo; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://forward.com/fast-forward/366077/watch-vice-co-founder-makes-10-things-i-hate-about-jews-video/\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;posted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt; a video after a visit to Israel called &amp;ldquo;10 Things I Hate About Jews.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;Reilly defended his decision to bring McInnes, telling &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://gothamist.com/2018/10/12/gop_club_vandalized_gavin.php#photo-1\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;Gothamist&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;, &amp;ldquo;He is part of the right. We promote people and ideas of all kinds from the right.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;Earlier this year, Golden was forced to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://bklyner.com/senator-marty-goldens-staffer-shares-anti-semitic-facebook-posts-candidates-call-on-golden-to-fire-him/\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;fire another staffer,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt; Anthony Testaverde, after he shared posts on Facebook comparing the Parkland survivors to Hitler Youth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;The Golden campaign declined to comment on Reilly or the vandalism at Union Temple for this story. Through spokesman Michael Tobman, the campaign did provide the following statement to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;Jewish Currents&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt; on the shooting in Squirrel Hill: &amp;ldquo;Senator Golden, along with the rest of America and the world, mourns those killed in the horrific Pittsburgh synagogue attack. No political discussion around this tragedy is appropriate now.\"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;But, of course, the mass murder in Pittsburgh was highly political itself. It is easy to link the antisemitism of the suspect arrested for the shooting and the white supremacism either encouraged or tolerated by mainstream Republican politics. And it extends well beyond just the Tree of Life shooting: on Saturday, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/davidmack/tallahassee-yoga-shooter-incel-far-right-misogyny-video\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;reported&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt; that a man who shot and killed two people in a Tallahassee yoga studio &amp;ldquo;was a far-right extremist and self-proclaimed misogynist who railed against women, black people, and immigrants in a series of online videos and songs.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s a very clear question: you either draw a line at white nationalist violence, or you don't,&amp;rdquo; said Sophie Ellman-Golan, a member of The Jewish Vote, who helped organize Friday&amp;rsquo;s action at Golden&amp;rsquo;s office along with members of Yalla Brooklyn and the Muslim Democratic Club of NY. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s very clear Marty Golden does not. We're asking him to fire Ian Reilly. We are asking him to unequivocally denounce white nationalist violence.&amp;rdquo; The Jewish Vote, with IfNotNow, HIAS, and other progressive Jewish organizations, helped organize a vigil for the Pittsburgh victims in Union Square last week.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;But Liam McCabe, a GOP operative and member of the Brooklyn Republican Party&amp;rsquo;s Executive Board, went to bat for Reilly and his boss.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;&amp;ldquo;I know Ian Reilly to be a good guy, who cares about his community and loves Republican politics,&amp;rdquo; McCabe told &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;Jewish Currents&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;. &amp;ldquo;What they&amp;rsquo;ve accused him of is outrageous and libelous. To call someone you don&amp;rsquo;t even know a white supremacist is very strong language.&amp;rdquo; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;McCabe agreed that some of the rhetoric at the national level&amp;mdash;Trump&amp;rsquo;s and the Democrats&amp;rsquo;&amp;mdash;is &amp;ldquo;dangerous,&amp;rdquo; but the notion that Golden is responsible for antisemitism in Brooklyn is &amp;ldquo;ridiculous.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;&amp;ldquo;If Marty fires Reilly, it sets a bad precedent,&amp;rdquo; McCabe told me. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s an unfair attack. And it holds Marty to a standard the left is not holding Andrew Gounardes to,&amp;rdquo; he said, citing Gounardes&amp;rsquo;s endorsements from Reform Party chair Bob Capano, who used Islamophobic rhetoric to smear then-city council candidate Reverend Khader El-Yateem in 2017, and Arab American activist Linda Sarsour, infamous among conservatives for unapologetic leftist and pro-Palestinian statements. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;But Gounardes doesn&amp;rsquo;t think it&amp;rsquo;s such a stretch to connect the rising tide of racism and bigotry in America to his opponent&amp;rsquo;s unwillingness to denounce white nationalism. &amp;ldquo;There may not be a straight line. But there is a relationship between the graffiti we saw last night, the murders in Pittsburgh, the Proud Boys coming to New York and inciting riots,&amp;rdquo; Gounardes said. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s all a product of the normalization of antisemitism, bigotry, and xenophobia in our society.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;figure class=\"aligncenter\"&gt;&lt;img title=\"goldenprotest\" src=\"https://www.datocms-assets.com/4857/1541439824-img0563.JPG\" alt=\"goldenprotest\" width=\"640\" height=\"428\" /&gt;\n&lt;figcaption&gt;Demonstrators outside the Golden campaign office.

To not hide. To feel comfortable and loved and held in doing that.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;Toward the end of the protest, an unidentified man in an FDNY t-shirt pushed through the crowd to enter the office, shoving several protestors. Miriam Levia Grossman, who had helped lead the prayer, says the man grabbed her butt as he passed. &amp;ldquo;I was stunned,&amp;rdquo; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10100568776010154&amp;amp;set=a.601950713824&amp;amp;type=3&amp;amp;theater\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;she wrote on Facebook&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;. &amp;ldquo;Is this happening? Is he really touching my body as I am grieving?&amp;rdquo; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;&amp;ldquo;I came back to my body and thought- Right...this is what oppressors do,&amp;rdquo; Grossman wrote. &amp;ldquo;They attack from every angle. They do what they can to put you in your place- to convince you that you are not powerful. That you are small.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;For these activists, the state senate race is a referendum on some very basic values. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;&amp;ldquo;To Marty Golden and all other leaders of the GOP: Renounce White Nationalism,&amp;rdquo; Grossman wrote. &amp;ldquo;We are coming for your seats with our votes. Believe that.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;But unseating Golden won&amp;rsquo;t be easy. He has kept the seat for 16 years by consistently turning out conservative white voters in the district&amp;rsquo;s tonier neighborhoods. Gounardes will need a Democratic turnout that&amp;rsquo;s at least as big as optimistically projected, especially among young voters, Arabs, and immigrants. Gounardes told me he worries these attacks&amp;mdash;and the rhetoric from the right&amp;mdash;are part of an effort to strike fear into voters. On Friday, Golden&amp;rsquo;s campaign Twitter account sent out a &amp;ldquo;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/Marty4Senate/status/1058395382726713344\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;public safety notice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;&amp;rdquo; that the Gounardes campaign was &amp;ldquo;asking our neighbors to share - with strangers! - when their homes &amp;amp; apartments will be empty.&amp;rdquo; The tweet referenced standard get out the vote campaign literature which asks people what time of day they plan to vote.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;&amp;ldquo;This is not covert voter suppression, this is overt, explicit, direct attempts to engage in voter suppression of the worst kind,&amp;rdquo; Gounardes told &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;Jewish Currents&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;After their prayers at Golden&amp;rsquo;s office, protestors marched to the Islamic Society of Bay Ridge as Tsibele, a local klezmer band, played in time.

So much of my personal frustration with a lot of the conversations about transness in the media is that these stories are written and reported by cis people. The idea that cis people can define what it means to be trans or define sex or gender&amp;mdash;these are ideas that are seeped in white supremacy, colonialism, and Western ideals of what it means to be a person. They&amp;rsquo;re just an effort to limit people's imaginations and their daily experiences, and it has material consequences. It encourages this idea that trans people aren't real and aren't who they say they are. That leads to [trans people] not being able to get a job, not being able to have housing, not being able to find a lawyer, or mount a successful case when they&amp;rsquo;re discriminated against. It leads to things like trans people being criminalized.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;HSF: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;How do you define liberation?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;HM:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt; I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing a lot about what trans liberation means to me. I think just articulating those ideas about trans people living and persisting and thriving into the future is a great way to confront this rhetoric. At the heart of it, I think trans liberation is similar to the liberation of all people, it&amp;rsquo;s interconnected. So issues like allowing trans people, and all people, to migrate wherever they need to, to cross borders freely. Allowing trans people to access shelters that correspond with their gender identity. It&amp;rsquo;s about breaking down these spaces in public and private life and in public services that are so attached to what your gender is. Liberation looks like being able to decide how your body looks and moves in the world, like having people respect the language you use to describe yourself. It&amp;rsquo;s having access to trans-inclusive education. It&amp;rsquo;s being able to grow up in a world where you're not afraid to walk outside every day. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;HSF: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;How has Chicago inspired you as a writer? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;HM:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt; Chicago's poetry community, especially the youth poetry community, has had a huge influence on me, specifically in that it's introduced me to people from different neighborhoods and to people who identify differently, whether that's race, religion, gender, or sexual identity. All these people from all over the city come together, listen to each other's stories, and respect one another. It informs my idea of what the city looks like and gives me confidence that people who are not queer or trans can respect me. Chicago also has a rich queer and trans artistic community. I came up through underground performance spaces, bars, and queer party nights that had performance elements to them. Those were the first people who supported me. I got my skills as a poet and performer through Chicago&amp;rsquo;s poetry scene as I was building queer and trans community in these underground queer arts spaces, and that&amp;rsquo;s what really shaped me as an artist.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;HSF: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;Can you tell me about the inspiration and writing process for the title poem in the collection, &amp;ldquo;On My Way to Liberation&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;HM: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;This is one of the most important poems to me in this collection, about my grandfather&amp;rsquo;s history of crossing gender norms in order to stay close to his family for a little bit longer during the Holocaust. It took me a really long time to write. I started it describing my experience of going to celebrate the anniversary of my grandfather&amp;rsquo;s liberation from the concentration camps. I had gone through a couple of drafts of the poem a few years ago, at that point there was something I didn&amp;rsquo;t really like about it. I think working with another queer poet, a teacher, Shira Erlichman, helped me to find the right ending for the poem&amp;mdash;just making the connection between my grandfather and my current trans identity, that we have gone through similar acts of changing our names and changing our clothes, and people discriminating against us for who we are. That was a huge leap that I had to make, realizing that the poem was about liberation and our shared history.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;My grandfather is one of the main storytellers in the family. From a young age, I knew he was a Holocaust survivor. He came to my classroom in high school and told his story; he has always been insistent on sharing his story. Remembering history through the perspectives of people who lived through it and specifically those who experienced oppression is incredibly important. I definitely inherited that tradition. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;HSF:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt; How does this chapbook relate to your full-length collection &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;There Are Trans People Here&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;, out next year?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;HM:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt; In the past, I&amp;rsquo;ve used chapbooks as a way to lean into a collection or figure out what direction I'm going as a writer. What became clear in writing this chapbook and assembling poems from the past several years is the shift from writing about cis violence and the ways I've been hurt by cis people to trying to heal and write into the trans future I want to see. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;There Are Trans People Here&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt; is going to focus on writing out that trans future in more detail&amp;mdash;creating this vision of what trans liberation can look like, talking about all the different places trans people exist and all the ways we contribute to the world. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;I encourage people in this moment and always to seek out trans voices and recognize trans people in their own lives, whether that's at their workplace or in their family, school, or neighborhood. Talk with those people. Listen to their stories.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There Are Trans People Here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;After Jamaal May&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;There are trans people here,&lt;br /&gt;so many trans people here&lt;br /&gt;is what I am trying to say.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;When they say we are all&lt;br /&gt;trapped in the wrong body&lt;br /&gt;impostor, impossible.

From a vastly different place in the world, I was just getting home from my evening commute when I checked my email on my phone. In my inbox was a message from Rosario Ceballo, Associate Dean of Social Sciences at the University of Michigan, calling me into a meeting with her and the chair of my department. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;This email was intimidating but not entirely unexpected. The day before I had replied to a former student who had asked for a letter of recommendation to study abroad at a university in Israel. I explained to them that my participation in a boycott of Israel would bar me from writing on their behalf for this particular program.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;This past March, the US Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel (USACBI) publicized the importance of applying the boycott specifically to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://usacbi.org/boycott-study-abroad-in-israel/\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;study abroad&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt; programs, arguing that &amp;ldquo;to enroll, or participate in any way, in a Study Abroad program at an Israeli institution means ignoring if not perpetuating the ongoing violation of the academic&amp;mdash;and, indeed, human&amp;mdash;freedoms of Palestinians.&amp;rdquo; Additionally, undergraduate students in UM&amp;rsquo;s chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine, called &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/SAFEUmich/\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;Students Allied for Freedom and Equality (SAFE)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;, has been asking the administration to protect them from the discrimination they face as a result of standing up for Palestinians, with no response. They wrote in a recent &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.michigandaily.com/section/mic/students-allied-freedom-and-equality-university-michigan-stands-solidarity-students\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;statement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt; &amp;ldquo;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;For years, students at the University of Michigan have been consistently targeted on international political blacklists . . . This blacklist is just one of several tangible barriers for students that will prevent them from engaging in not just study abroad programs, but academic programs, jobs, and admittance into Palestine/Israel.&amp;rdquo; The disproportionate attention &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;paid to securing some students&amp;rsquo; opportunities and not others&amp;rsquo; illuminates the importance of the boycott not only for Palestinians living in Palestine, but also for their American student advocates, some of whom are Palestinian themselves. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;The exchange with my student occurred shortly after a similar episode at UM which drew national attention. University of Michigan American Culture professor John Cheney-Lippold told a student who wanted to study abroad in Israel that he could not write on their behalf because he is a participant in the BDS movement. This choice is unsurprising coming from an American Culture professor, since the American Studies Association collectively &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.theasa.net/what-does-boycott-mean\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;endorsed &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;the boycott of Israel in 2013. Although I didn&amp;rsquo;t know it when I declined my student&amp;rsquo;s request, Dr. Cheney-Lippold faced serious consequences from the university for his choice; he has since been &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/michigan/2018/10/09/university-michigan-disciplines-professor-over-israel-letter-controversy/1580969002\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;punished&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt; with a one-year salary freeze and barred from going on sabbatical for the next few years. He has also been threatened with termination if his support for BDS leads to &amp;ldquo;interfering with a student&amp;rsquo;s academic aspirations&amp;rdquo; in the future. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;Before deciding not to write the recommendation, I weighed my options with careful consideration, as I have been doing with respect to my involvement in BDS for many years now. Was I justified in invoking the boycott in this particular scenario? How would I explain myself? As a student of politics, I knew well that public universities hold a great deal of political power and that each of us are agents of that power, albeit to different extents. As a participant in BDS, I knew that my actions would necessarily entail an exercise of power that would have implications not only for UM students beyond the particular student in question, but also for Palestinians. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;As of now, it remains to be seen how or if I will be punished with respect to my job as a graduate student instructor or my status as a graduate student at UM, upon both of which I am financially dependent. However, the University&amp;rsquo;s president and provost issued &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://president.umich.edu/news-communications/letters-to-the-community/letter-important-questions-around-issues-of-personal-beliefs-our-responsibilities-as-educators-and-anti-semitism/\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;a statement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt; on Tuesday, October 9th condemning both my and Professor Cheney-Lippold&amp;rsquo;s actions as unsupportive of our students, contrary to the university&amp;rsquo;s mission, and unfairly lacking separation between our personal beliefs and professional responsibilities. They promised that I, like Dr. Cheney-Lippold, will face &amp;ldquo;serious consequences.&amp;rdquo; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;These events have brought BDS activism into ongoing discussions in universities about what is owed to students. Some have emphasized that instructors have a fiduciary responsibility to students such that we must do our best to help them fulfill their academic and career goals. But how are we supposed to balance the corporatization of public universities, which turns students into consumers and teachers into goods and services providers, with the very real political power universities wield? Are all of us&amp;mdash;faculty, student instructors, administrators, and students &amp;mdash;supposed to passively embrace the imperatives of the corporate model? And, at any rate, does the corporate model somehow override the constitutionally secured right to boycott? Finally and most importantly: what is the responsibility of public universities to step in against injustices against Palestinians? It is my belief that my university and others need to be held accountable for answering this question, without hiding behind corporate imperatives or misplaced accusations of religious discrimination.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;In addition to promising to punish me, in their letter to the UM community the president and the provost allude to religious discrimination. Although the word antisemitism only appears in the letter&amp;rsquo;s title and first sentence, the association they made between participating in BDS and antisemitism was unmistakable. The letter claims that &amp;ldquo;the incidents have caused hurt and made some members of our community feel that their religious identity and academic aspirations are not valued.&amp;rdquo; As a Jewish woman, I am deeply troubled by the implied connection that President Schlissel and Provost Philbert make between criticism of Israel and antisemitism. Moreover, neither one spoke with me personally before expressing their certainty around this very complex political and psychic terrain. Had they done so, they would know that I am very concerned about antisemitism in its abundant and distressing manifestations, both historically and contemporarily. I would have liked the chance to explain to them that, as a teacher and student of politics, I believe it to be of the utmost importance that our students be able to think critically about Israel, especially as it relates to their religious, cultural or national identities. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;In this particular instance, I tried to be very explicit about putting the state of Israel on the one hand and the student&amp;rsquo;s identity, religious and otherwise, on the other. From where I stand, these are separable and, in fact, need to be separated. The fact that it was interpreted as religious discrimination by numerous members of the UM community and beyond, and that this interpretation was then shockingly legitimized by the most powerful university administrators, attests to colossal work ahead of us&amp;mdash;as educators, as students, as American Jews&amp;mdash;to be able to discuss bravely and with sincere disagreement what Israel means to each of us. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;I have since met with Associate Dean Ceballo, who wrote me the October 4th email, to talk about what happened. At the time of the meeting, on October 9th, I had not yet read the president and provost&amp;rsquo;s letter to the University of Michigan community. While the rest of the campus was reading their perspective on the situation, I sat in a room at a small conference table with Associate Dean Ceballo, the chair of the political science department, my union representative (thankfully), and a university HR official. In addition to asking whether I would be willing to write a generic letter of recommendation that would go in the student&amp;rsquo;s file, the Dean asked me to detail all the different ways I had considered responding to the student before sending the email that I did: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;Did you direct the student to another professor who could write on their behalf? Did you offer to meet with the student?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;What if we posed some of the questions asked of me back to the university administration? Did an administrator direct the student to another one of their instructors so they could complete their application? The &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;Washington Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2018/10/09/a-second-michigan-instructor-withheld-a-recommendation-letter-from-student-headed-to-israel/?utm_term=.1d8c746e9d0f\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;reported&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt; that Associate Dean Ceballo had already offered to write the student&amp;rsquo;s recommendation letter by the time she spoke to me, so she, for her part, would have to answer for offering to write a letter of recommendation on behalf of a student whom she presumably does not know in any meaningful capacity. Did the administration consider facilitating a meeting between the student and me to help both of us understand the thoughts and feelings of the other? What individual harm could have been undone if someone, anyone, had taken this route? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;The failure to encourage open and honest communication between instructors and students by the university administration in this instance demonstrates at least two grave failures: a failure to model for our students that we are all members of an academic community of respected equals, and a failure to accept and confront the presence of high-stakes politics in this line of work, which made it impossible for the administration to respond gracefully in the moment. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;More important than how my situation was handled, however, is that these recent events have raised questions about the global political impact of public universities. University of Michigan should be held accountable for the way that &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://record.umich.edu/articles/20m-kahn-foundation-gift-expands-michigan-israel-research-effort\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;institutional ties&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt; between UM and Israeli universities certifies and strengthens the occupation, especially seeing as UM students and researchers are for the most part &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://global.umich.edu/travel-resources/warnings-restrictions/palestinian-territories/\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;prohibited &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;from studying in Gaza, nor are there any study abroad partnerships with Palestinian universities for UM undergraduates to attend. Regardless of whether or not the University changes its relationship to Israel/Palestine, at the very least, individuals who hold positions within the university must nevertheless be free to engage in critical discourse and disagreement about the university&amp;rsquo;s purpose. It also means that no single individual, not even the university president, should have the last word on what it means to act in the best interest of the students. Scaring faculty and students into hiding their allegiances to BDS, or any other movement for justice, is simply not in the community&amp;rsquo;s best interest.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lucy Peterson&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt; is a graduate student in the Political Science Department at the University of Michigan. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","authors":{"id":"437563","name":"Lucy Peterson","slug":"lucy-peterson","description":"A description about this author should go here.","itemType":"26697","creator":"1337","meta":{"ctime":"2018-10-23T15:28:03.428Z","mtime":"2018-10-23T15:28:03.472Z","contentType":{"id":"26697","name":"author"},"required":["slug"]}},"categories":{"id":"261980","title":"Essay","slug":"essay","position":19,"parentId":null,"itemType":"26695","creator":"1336","meta":{"ctime":"2018-04-14T22:17:24.583Z","mtime":"2018-04-14T22:17:24.590Z","contentType":{"id":"26695","name":"category"},"required":["title","slug"]}},"themePrimaryColor":null,"featuredPost":false,"featuredImage":{"path":"/4857/1540308517-dosibp2v4aihajj.jpg","format":"jpg","size":156714,"alt":null,"title":null,"width":908,"height":606},"thumbnailImage":null,"postImage":null,"postImageCaption":"","headerImageCaption":"A University of Michigan student government meeting on divestment from Israel in November 2017.

The man believed to be behind the shooting, Robert D. Bowers, who was taken into custody after a standoff with police, was transparent about his intentions: in the act of committing the murders, Bowers reportedly yelled, &amp;ldquo;All Jews must die.&amp;rdquo; This was all made terrifyingly clear once he was apprehended, within a few hours of when news of the shooting first broke. By midday, liberal activists in New York City, where I live, had already organized a Saturday evening vigil in Union Square, set for seven o&amp;rsquo;clock.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;I arrived at the vigil 20 minutes early, alternately keen and anxious to see how many people would show up. Within an hour, hundreds had arrived. By the time I left at around eight, there were at least a thousand people, faces streaked with tears and rain and twisted by anguish, eyes downcast with the disconsoling realization that the resurgence of public antisemitism over the past few years has now finally matured into that distinct, horrifying American tradition: the mass shooting. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;Though the Tree of Life shooting is the most deadly attack on Jews in American history, it is merely the latest chapter in the ongoing story of American white supremacist violence. There was the 2012 murder of six people at a Sikh temple in Milwaukee, then Dylan Roof&amp;rsquo;s massacre of nine black churchgoers in South Carolina in 2015, followed by the killing of Heather Heyer at the Charlottesville Unite the Right rally last year, with too many attacks to name in between and since. Just this week, a Trump-obsessed man in Florida was arrested for mailing bombs to leading critics of the president, and it was discovered that the man who shot to death a black man and woman in a Kentucky supermarket had attempted to enter a predominantly black church before settling on a Kroger&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;The roots of this violence go deeper than Trump, though it is undeniable that his candidacy and election catalyzed its rise; you can take the white supremacists at their word on that one. Right-wing institutions like Fox News and the Republican Party itself were constitutive in this regard, particularly with the massacre at Squirrel Hill. For the last couple weeks they have screamed George Soros&amp;rsquo; name as they pointed fingers at a so-called refugee &amp;ldquo;caravan&amp;rdquo; coming north to the Mexican border, suggesting that the Jewish billionaire was financing and facilitating the en masse entry of Latin American migrants and asylum seekers to the United States. Robert D. Bowers claimed to have been exercised by pretty much the same thing: hours before he stormed the synagogue with an assault rifle and a handgun, Bowers posted online, &amp;ldquo;HIAS [the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society] likes to bring invaders in that kill our people. I can&amp;rsquo;t sit by and watch my people get slaughtered. Screw your optics, I&amp;rsquo;m going in.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;The Trump administration, Republican officials, and right-wing media apparatchiks, of course, have shamelessly stayed the course. Hours after the shooting, Chris Farrell, of the influential conservative group Judicial Watch, made reference to the &amp;ldquo;Soros-occupied State Department&amp;rdquo; on Lou Dobbs&amp;rsquo; Fox Business Network show. Though there have many solemn tweets and statements about the need to eradicate hatred, which themselves read like an algorithmic imitation of what a public figure should say (Ivanka Trump: &amp;ldquo;All good Americans stand with the Jewish people to oppose acts of terror &amp;amp; share the horror, disgust &amp;amp; outrage over the massacre in Pittsburgh. We must unite against hatred &amp;amp; evil. God bless those affected&amp;rdquo;), there has been nothing resembling contrition. This is no surprise. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;HOW DO WE RECONCILE &lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;the contradiction at the heart of modern American Jewish life: Jews have seldom had so comfortable and so privileged a place in society, while simultaneously there has emerged the most toxic current of public antisemitism since World War II, when American Nazi sympathizers rallied in Madison Square Garden by the thousands. Upon reflection, it seems almost shocking that it took until 2018 for someone to successfully carry out such an attack on a Jewish place of worship.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;Though it may be seductive to think that antisemitism has always been a part of American public life, a feature of antisemitism&amp;rsquo;s supposedly unique, eternal nature (&amp;ldquo;history&amp;rsquo;s oldest hatred,&amp;rdquo; so the saying goes), this is a misdiagnosis. The German socialist August Bebel famously quipped that &amp;ldquo;antisemitism is the socialism of fools,&amp;rdquo; a remark that brings us closer to the truth: antisemitism thrives in unsettled times, when the institutions tasked with keeping society from falling apart are themselves coming undone. We are now living in such a time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;figure class=\"aligncenter\"&gt;&lt;img class=\"aligncenter\" title=\"asc1237\" src=\"https://www.datocms-assets.com/4857/1540823292-asc1237.jpg\" alt=\"asc1237\" width=\"675\" height=\"451\" /&gt;\n&lt;figcaption&gt;Attendees at the vigil sing together in the rain. Photo: Gili Getz&lt;/figcaption&gt;\n&lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;In post-New Deal America, Jews ascended to the heights of American society. Alongside other barrier-breaking minorities, Jews became baseball stars, leading academics and politicians, and even won their own &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/politicaljunkie/2009/05/heres_a_question_from_carol.html\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;unofficial&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt; Supreme Court seat. But unlike many other minorities, Jews also won the privileges of whiteness, successfully leaving riotous and desiccated urban cores for the comforts of the suburbs, where they were able to settle, buy homes, and send their children to schools in communities that black Americans could only dream of.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;But the flawed liberal social contract that emerged after the New Deal and World War II&amp;mdash;weak-tea social democracy that lifted millions of Americans, Jews included, into the middle class and beyond, alongside substantial but insufficient civil rights reforms&amp;mdash;is fraying. Overt racism once nominally kept in check by political and business elites has moved from the back- to the foreground, as the failure of the American right wing&amp;rsquo;s actual political program has become ever more apparent. Added to the mix is social media, corporate-run platforms of discourse whose chief bias is to encourage more time spent on social media, for which it turns out stoking race hatred and bigotry is an extremely effective, if unplanned, engagement tactic. Antisemitism, all the while, has been making its slow reentry into the public sphere.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;IT IS OBVIOUSLY &lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;no coincidence that antisemitism&amp;mdash;both its language and its practice&amp;mdash;has reared its head at a time when nativism, racism, and far-right lunacy more generally have come into fashion. At a time when the established order of things is cracking, and &amp;ldquo;anxiety&amp;rdquo; about racial and class precarity stoked by the right wing is reaching ever-higher levels, it is natural that crackpot theories about Jewish influence would gain currency, and it was inevitable that the spike in the number of antisemitic hate crimes would translate to an increase in the severity of those crimes. But while there is nothing inevitable about what is required to turn back this rising tide of hate, the vigil at Union Square offered one path forward.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;The speakers at the event, which was organized by a coterie of left-wing groups including Jews for Racial and Economic Justice, IfNotNow, and Bend the Arc, laid out a clear vision of the required mutual solidarity that is the only escape from the morass of violence and hatred in which we now find ourselves. &amp;ldquo;We will advocate for others whom we believe should be here too,&amp;rdquo; said Sophie Ellman-Golan, an organizer from Jews for Racial and Economic Justice. &amp;ldquo;Their theory is conquer by division, and we will not let that happen,&amp;rdquo; added Murad Awawdeh, of the New York Immigration Coalition, noting that a number of Muslim individuals were on hand providing security for the event, a favor that the Jewish vigil organizers pledged to return for &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;iftar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt; next spring. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;We may only have the contours, and not yet the precise plans, for how to build successful coalitions to fight the overwhelming reactionary currents coursing through civil society. But we need to start with the commitment to solidarity demonstrated at the vigil. &amp;ldquo;They came for the Muslims, they came for the immigrants, they came for our African-American brothers and sisters, and this week they will be coming for migrant refugees,&amp;rdquo; Awawdeh continued. &amp;ldquo;I stand here today, in solidarity and in love, with you all.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Noah Kulwin&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt; is a co-editor of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;Jewish Currents&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","authors":{"id":"228163","name":"Noah Kulwin","slug":"noah-kulwin","description":"","itemType":"26697","creator":"8080","meta":{"ctime":"2018-03-20T02:26:02.251Z","mtime":"2018-03-20T02:26:02.256Z","contentType":{"id":"26697","name":"author"},"required":["slug"]}},"categories":{"id":"261980","title":"Essay","slug":"essay","position":19,"parentId":null,"itemType":"26695","creator":"1336","meta":{"ctime":"2018-04-14T22:17:24.583Z","mtime":"2018-04-14T22:17:24.590Z","contentType":{"id":"26695","name":"category"},"required":["title","slug"]}},"themePrimaryColor":null,"featuredPost":false,"featuredImage":{"path":"/4857/1540822888-asc0873.jpg","format":"jpg","size":883074,"alt":null,"title":null,"width":1100,"height":734},"thumbnailImage":null,"postImage":null,"postImageCaption":"","headerImageCaption":"Performing Havdalah at the NYC vigil.

Brandeis University Press, 2018. 272 pages.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;THE AMERICAN JEWISH COMMUNITY&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt; tells a very particular story about its history. We came over to the United States, mostly from Europe, as poor, often persecuted immigrants, and through a commitment to education and hard work, we rose collectively to seize the American dream. We especially like to highlight our commitment to civil rights and the African American struggle in the 50s and 60s, and in the decades thereafter our energized commitment to the state of Israel. While most Jews acknowledge that yes, things appear less harmonious today between blacks and Jews, we don&amp;rsquo;t dwell too long on those details. And besides, we learn, it was African American separatists who turned their backs on the interfaith work anyway. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;In &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;Black Power, Jewish Politics: Reinventing the Alliance in the 1960s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;, Marc Dollinger, a historian in the Department of Jewish Studies at San Francisco State University, tells a very different kind of story. After scouring primary sources from the era, he finds that Jews not only anticipated the splintering of the great interfaith, interracial coalition years before it happened, they also acknowledged their responsibility for the split. What&amp;rsquo;s more, Jews benefited directly from it. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not unfounded that most young American Jews grow up learning about the role Jewish activists played in the civil rights movement. Jews really were involved and supportive in ways that differed from other white subgroups. Polls from the era revealed that Jews were almost twice as likely as white Protestants to consider &amp;ldquo;racial inequality&amp;rdquo; the most important issue of the day, and over a third of Jewish respondents thought civil rights reform was &amp;ldquo;too slow.&amp;rdquo; Jews comprised at least 30 percent of the white Freedom Riders, lent critical financial support to organizations like the NAACP, and submitted amicus briefs in support of civil rights to the Supreme Court. In 1963, Holocaust survivor and Newark rabbi Joachim Prinz spoke just before Martin Luther King Jr. at the March on Washington, and in 1965, Rabbi Abraham Heschel famously &amp;ldquo;prayed with his feet&amp;rdquo; as he marched alongside King in Selma, Alabama.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;Still, that&amp;rsquo;s not the full picture. Because despite their vocal support for the African American struggle, most Jews were not risking their livelihoods for black freedom in any real way. As Dollinger writes, Southern Jews embraced Dixie and were overwhelmingly silent on civil rights. Northern Jews took pride in their support for justice, but &amp;ldquo;most experienced that movement from the safety and comfort of their living rooms, where they read about direct-action protests in the newspaper or watched it on television.&amp;rdquo; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;On top of their oft-exaggerated support, Jews actually began to retreat from the civil rights movement in the 1960s, a retreat documented at the time in a slew of confidential ADL memos authored by local regional leaders for the national office. While the leaders expressed concern over growing black militancy, &amp;ldquo;they also framed their assessment,&amp;rdquo; Dollinger writes, &amp;ldquo;. . . with a clear awareness of Jewish culpability in damaging relations with African American civil rights leaders.&amp;rdquo; One Buffalo ADL leader wrote that members of his local Jewish community felt blacks were &amp;ldquo;stirring things up too much.&amp;rdquo; Another leader overseeing the Arkansas, Louisiana, and Mississippi region wrote, &amp;ldquo;the Jewish community is not fully living up to its own power . . . [and] by and large do not get involved in the area of race relations.&amp;rdquo; These private conversations and acknowledgements eventually spilled over into the public. &amp;ldquo;The dirty little secret of our community after all,&amp;rdquo; Dollinger quotes a Jewish activist saying to the Synagogue Council of America in 1969, &amp;ldquo;is that its leaders have always spoken more forcefully and radically than its followers have felt.&amp;rdquo; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;This recognition of the partial blame Jews shouldered meant that when African American leaders began voicing frustration with their Jewish allies, tired of their gradualism and paternalism, Jewish leaders often conceded those critiques had validity. And when some of those African American frustrations veered into outright antisemitism, Jewish leaders tended to minimize the prejudice. &amp;ldquo;Embracing the era's emerging analysis of power relations, they differentiated between antisemitism, which posed relatively little risk to the continued social mobility of American Jews, and racism, which continued to limit African American advance,&amp;rdquo; Dollinger writes. It&amp;rsquo;s hard to fathom American Jewish leaders issuing such measured responses to black antisemitism today. Consider the Jewish establishment&amp;rsquo;s fixation with pressuring black leaders like Keith Ellison or Women&amp;rsquo;s March co-founder Tamika Mallory to disavow Louis Farrakhan and his greatly diminished Nation of Islam.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;A central tenet of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;Black Power, Jewish Politics&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt; is that as this political rift opened between blacks and Jews in the late 1960s, as black activists began organizing more exclusively by and for black Americans, the space for Jews to organize by and for Jews in the United States widened, too. This then enabled Jewish leaders to build a new kind of narrative for the Jewish community, one of &amp;ldquo;Klal Yisrael.&amp;rdquo; Sometimes that meant flooding the streets and Capitol Hill on behalf of Soviet Jewry and the State of Israel. Sometimes that meant organizing for more explicitly Jewish institutions in the United States like an expansion of Jewish day schools. (There were 35 Jewish day schools in 1940, with that number rising to 323 by 1965, and 425 by 1973.) Jews began to publicly lean into identity politics in a way that before would have felt unkosher, too vulnerable to charges of dual loyalty. &amp;ldquo;Black Power proved quite good for the Jews,&amp;rdquo; Dollinger quips at one point.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;Neoconservative intellectuals helped bolster this new framework of Jewish community. In 1971, Nathan Glazer, a former &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;Commentary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt; magazine editor, argued that Jewish dissidents who challenged this newfound unity around Israel (and anti-communism) displayed &amp;ldquo;anti-Jewish tendencies.&amp;rdquo; That same year Norman Podhoretz argued in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;Commentary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt; that Jewish radicals who challenged the communal consensus were actually committing acts of antisemitism. As Jews drifted further from their roots of interracial, interfaith solidarity, they adopted the language of solidarity more exclusively and dogmatically for themselves. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;Today, rather than teach young Jews the different ways Jewish Americans responded to the civil rights movement&amp;mdash;including both inaction and opposition&amp;mdash;we opt for a sanitized picture that obscures the complex racial, economic, and geographical dynamics of the period. Rather than teach how Jewish and black leaders during the civil rights era recognized the often challenging power dynamics between the two communities, American Jews teach a glorified history of Jews as brave, selfless allies, motivated by our sense of tikkun olam, unfairly spurned by black nationalists later on. Just this past spring James Kirchick penned an essay in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;Commentary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt; echoing this narrative, touting Jewish involvement in the NAACP and the civil rights movement, and how &amp;ldquo;perplexing and painful&amp;rdquo; it was when black separatist movements like the Nation of Islam and Black Panthers grew in power, espousing a &amp;ldquo;Third Worldist ideology&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;anti-Israel (and often anti-Semitic) rhetoric.&amp;rdquo; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;Meanwhile, the ADL is hardly on the front lines of the civil rights movement anymore. Beginning in the 1980s, as American Jews continued to climb the economic ranks and assimilate into white society, the group&amp;rsquo;s approach shifted away from overt political advocacy toward providing educational resources and workshops for combating racial bias and discrimination. Today the ADL goes so far as to sponsor annual trips to Israel for US law enforcement to learn from and train with Israeli police and military officials. While the organization casts these experiences as opportunities for enhanced counterterrorism efforts, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to defend equipping American police with the discriminatory tactics deployed by an occupying army. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;Unfortunately, in the name of Klal Yisrael, we&amp;rsquo;ve simultaneously thwarted intellectual growth in our community and hindered real accountability. While there is greater individual reckoning on the part of Jews with the power dynamics between ourselves and African Americans, our engagement in solidarity activism rarely examines our community&amp;rsquo;s power and wealth. This past summer, Rabbi Rick Jacobs, president of the Union for Reform Judaism, gave a speech at the tail end of the Poor People&amp;rsquo;s Campaign, saying that &amp;ldquo;Jewish tradition teaches us that poverty is the greatest issue facing our society.&amp;rdquo; While Jacobs is right to publicly highlight the issue of poverty, we in our community know that many wealthy American Jews&amp;mdash;including those who belong to Reform congregations&amp;mdash;oppose massive redistribution of wealth, and rarely have to answer for it. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;And rather than teach the rich tapestry of dissent and debate over the question of Jewish self-determination, we teach absolute support for Israel, as if questions around a Jewish nation-state have not only been settled, but were never really debated at all. Within our communal institutions, we censure voices that seek to stigmatize those with wretched politics and exorbitant wealth. It&amp;rsquo;s why mainstream Jewish organizations continue to ingratiate themselves at the feet of billionaires like Sheldon Adelson. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;This ideal of communal consensus is seductive and reassuring, as is emphasizing aspects of our history in which we can take pride. But it has prevented a real honest reckoning with Jewish history and Jewish power, and at whose expense our power has come. Books like &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;Black Power, Jewish Politics&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt; are a bold first step toward such a discussion.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rachel Cohen&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt; is a contributing writer to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;The Intercept&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt; and a freelance journalist based in Washington DC. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","authors":{"id":"439337","name":"Rachel Cohen","slug":"rachel-cohen","description":"A description about this author should go here.","itemType":"26697","creator":"1337","meta":{"ctime":"2018-10-25T15:24:03.467Z","mtime":"2018-10-25T15:24:03.482Z","contentType":{"id":"26697","name":"author"},"required":["slug"]}},"categories":{"id":"262153","title":"Review","slug":"review","position":24,"parentId":null,"itemType":"26695","creator":"1336","meta":{"ctime":"2018-04-15T23:20:56.314Z","mtime":"2018-04-15T23:20:56.320Z","contentType":{"id":"26695","name":"category"},"required":["title","slug"]}},"themePrimaryColor":null,"featuredPost":false,"featuredImage":{"path":"/4857/1540481226-ajhs.jpg","format":"jpg","size":1912857,"alt":null,"title":null,"width":2708,"height":2054},"thumbnailImage":{"path":"/4857/1540481750-ajhsfeatured.jpg","format":"jpg","size":1791554,"alt":null,"title":null,"width":2141,"height":1504},"postImage":null,"postImageCaption":"","headerImageCaption":"Rabbi Joachim Prinz (center-right, in sunglasses) marching with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. at the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.

by Bernard-Henri Lévy. Random House, 2017, 256 pages.\n&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHEN BERNARD-HENRI&lt;/strong&gt; Lévy burst onto the philosophical scene in the late 1970s as the leading voice of repentant young leftists known as the New Philosophers, the phenomenon was something of a mystery here in the U.S. Anti-communism and anti-Marxism were hardly novel or daring notions here, not even from former militants. We had long since had our Louis Budenz, Whittaker Chambers, and James Burnham, so there was really nothing all that striking about fallen Maoists like Lévy, André Glucksmann, or Christian Jambet and their anti-communist jeremiads. Even in France, there was a long tradition of anti-communism and anti-Marxism, and of much higher a level than our own, or indeed that of the New Philosophers. Cornelius Castoriadis, Boris Souvarine, Victor Serge, Raymond Aron, all acutely analyzed and critiqued both Soviet communism and Marxism. They did so minus the bombast and the media support of the new group, and they were by any measure vastly superior to the New Philosophers, who were benefiting from the backlash against May '68, the Chinese Cultural Revolution, and the ossification of the Soviet Union.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Despite his initial lionization, Lévy has often been the butt of ridicule that he has brought upon himself. Travelling to Afghanistan and dressing himself up as a &lt;em&gt;mujahid&lt;/em&gt;, he wrote about the war there, unstintingly praising the Islamist warlords fighting the Soviets. His book &lt;em&gt;L’Idéologie Française&lt;/em&gt;, which placed antisemitism at the heart of much of French political and intellectual life, was pilloried for its abuse of the conclusions of the great Israeli historian of the French far right, Ze’ev Sternhell, whose books he cribbed from mercilessly. Lévy's foray into filmmaking, the pompous and empty &lt;em&gt;Le Jour et la Nuit,&lt;/em&gt; was one of the worst-received films in French film history and was declared by the &lt;em&gt;Cahiers du&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Cinéma&lt;/em&gt; to be the worst film produced in France since World War II. Lévy also covered himself in ridicule when, in his typically omniscient fashion, he cited the philosopher Jean-Christophe Botul’s lectures in Paraguay on Kant in his 2010 &lt;em&gt;De la Guerre&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;en Philosophie&lt;/em&gt;. Botul, unfortunately for Lévy, was a fictional philosopher invented by Frédéric Pagès, created to mock the pomposity of actual philosophers, like Lévy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yet despite the mockery, he has remained an important presence in French life, advising politicians and omnipresent in the media. Now, decades beyond his sell-by date, he has produced his second book dedicated to Judaism, &lt;em&gt;The Genius of Judaism&lt;/em&gt;, a book so devoid of any intellectual value, so full of itself, that it leaves the reader stupefied.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pierre-Vidal Naquet, the great historian of the classical world, one of the true heroes of post-World War II French political life, a man who courageously defended the Algerian cause and put his life at risk condemning French use of torture during the Algerian War, asked, after reading Lévy’s previous book on Judaism, &lt;em&gt;Le Testament de Dieu&lt;/em&gt;: “How can a graduate of the Ecole Normale, with an advanced degree in philosophy… show such contempt for himself and his readers as to inflict such a ‘science’ on them?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These words are not harsh enough for &lt;em&gt;The Genius of Judaism&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even Garrison Keillor saw fit to go after Lévy. He famously skewered Lévy’s book on America, &lt;em&gt;American Vertigo&lt;/em&gt;, saying that Lévy “is a French writer with a spatter-paint prose style and the grandiosity of a college sophomore.” Though these words were written over a decade ago, in &lt;em&gt;The Genius of Judaism&lt;/em&gt;, sophomoric is still as high as he can reach.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UNSUBSTANTIATED&lt;/strong&gt;, erroneous, or simply hallucinatory assertions and interpretations flow ceaselessly through the pages of the book. The easiest fish to shoot in this barrel are his observations about America. According to Lévy “there were pogroms organized by black racists in Boston and, in August 1991, in Crown Heights, Brooklyn.” I have no recollection of any pogrom in Boston, and have found no mention of one anywhere, so perhaps Lévy can enlighten us as to when it occurred. As for the events in Crown Heights, they were, in the first case, not a pogrom, which is a word Lévy uses all too lightly: no Black Hundreds stormed down Eastern Parkway. Nor, in fact, was it organized. It broke out after two black children were struck by a hasidic driver and word quickly spread that the Hatzoloh ambulance on the scene had left the black children, one of whom died, while taking the Jewish driver of the fatal vehicle to the hospital. The ugliness of the three days of rioting cannot be denied (I, in fact, worked at the time in the hospital where the Yankel Rosenbaum died when the resident physicians who treated him failed to notice stab wounds in his back, so I know saw just how bad it was), but to compare what happened in Crown Heights to Kishinev is an abuse of language.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lévy also tirelessly and tiresomely hammers away at the presence of Holocaust denial here -- a marginal presence at best -- and misleadingly uses the present tense when writing that the “United States has the dubious privilege of hosting the Institute for Historical Review,” the center of Holocaust denial that imploded several years ago and exists as a mere rump organization, lacking the means to publish a journal or host international conferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It goes without saying that for Lévy the crimes and misdeeds of the BDS movement are proof of the evil eating away at America, bending our country’s life to its will. In fact, it is a movement that one could only wish had the power Lévy grants it. That thirteen states have bills banning it, that the Senate has passed a clearly unconstitutional law -– under cover of attacking antisemitism -– banning anti-Israeli speech and activities like BDS, are unknown to M. Lévy. To top it off, based on a statistical sample of a handful of conversations, he believes that Americans are clamoring for an end to U.S. support for Israel. Ever the condescending know-it-all, Lévy feels obliged to remind our misguided selves “that the country might have a strategic interest in defending the island of stability in the Middle East that is Israel.” As if the overwhelming majority of politicians, commentators, and people in America don’t feel the same -- and as if this defense of Israel were something novel.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RASHI&lt;/strong&gt;, the medieval French sage, is honored for, “ennobling the French language and making possible, a century later, the Perceval and Lancelot of an author whose first name was Christian but who was probably Jewish.” Rashi, I need not remind readers, wrote in Hebrew, but  “ennobled” French by including terms current in the French of the 12th century in his commentaries -- and so was, says Lévy, was a source of French literature, although Rashi wrote in a language that few of his countrymen could have read. As for the “Christian” in question, the writer Chrétien de Troyes, Lévy says he was likely a Jew because his name once appears as “Chretien li Gois,” which Levy accepts as meaning “the goy,” &lt;em&gt;i.e.,&lt;/em&gt; a convert (don’t ask me about the supposed the connection between goy and convert), but which is more likely a variant spelling of a town in the region. Chrétien would have been a strange Jew, having described Jews in his &lt;em&gt;Grail&lt;/em&gt; as “criminals who should be killed like dogs.” &lt;em&gt;The Genius of Judaism&lt;/em&gt; has no footnotes, however, so we are left wondering which “whole school of medievalists … asserted he was a member of the powerful Jewish community of Troyes.” Certainly many converts have surrendered to antisemitism, but it takes quite a refined mind to then turn the antisemitic convert into a Jewish courier of a nation’s culture.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let us not omit Lévy's insistence that the source of the French republic was not the inspiration of the Romans and the Greeks, but rather the Hebrew Bible, a claim that Lévy bases on the writings of a couple of minor figures whole ignoring the omnipresence of Roman ideals, characters, images, and even names among the men of the French Revolution. For Lévy, in his fantastic universe, the occultation of the Hebrew roots of the Republic was nothing but “deceit, carried out by every light of French republicanism, be they Gambetta, De Gaulle, or the Jew Mendes France.” One can only wonder if Lévy, for all his vaporing, ever read the Bible -- for a man who can assert that the ancient Hebrews set the French a “calmer and gentler” example than the Greco-Romans has missed huge chunks of the catalogue of slaughters that is the Hebrew Bible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In his attempt to salvage his absurd idea of the Jewish Biblical roots of French politics, he speaks of how the French royal houses “never ceased to affirm their kinship with David.” Is Lévy not aware that Jesus is supposed to have descended from David? When Kings Clovis and Pepin traced their roots to David, it was not to boast of Jewish ties or out of philosemitism, but rather to connect themselves to the royal blood that flowed in Jesus’ veins.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lévy’s twisted vision of French history even has him attacking Napoleon I for assembling the Great Sanhedrin, where, as he puts it, Napoleon, “has the nerve to ask the seventy-one rabbis and Jewish notables…if the law of the republic is compatible with theirs.” There is certainly an ambiguity in this, but it was done to finally put to rest any lingering suspicions about the newly emancipated Jews. That Bonaparte emancipated the Jews in every country he conquered doesn’t fit Lévy’s narrative, so it is omitted.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I COULD CONTINUE&lt;/strong&gt; almost endlessly, and a thorough critique of everything wrong in &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Genius of Judaism&lt;/em&gt; would require a book as long as the original. There’s a dubious statement on almost every page.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In his chapter on “How Modern Judaism Abolished the Idea of Revolution,” he presents the Jews and philosemites among his fellow New Philosophers as proof that Jews and Judaism put an end to the foolish messianism of revolution. But for every Glucksmann, Lévy and Finkielkraut, there is an Alain Krivine or Daniel Cohn-Bendit who has stayed the course. He quotes Michel Foucault as saying in 1977, “You know that it is the very desirability of revolution that is the problem today… [i]n the form that we desired it, it has become an impossibility; in the form that turned out to be possible in China and Cambodia it is no longer desirable.” Conveniently omitted is any mention of the fact that within a year Foucault would famously support the Iranian revolution of Khomeini.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lévy dishonorably attempts to enlist for his religious cause the uncompromising revolutionary Pierre Goldman, who Lévy asserts was returning to Judaism at the time of his assassination in 1979, when in fact he never ceased being a Jew. What return is needed for a man who titled his autobiography &lt;em&gt;Dim Memories of a Polish Jew Born in &lt;/em&gt;France? Lévy also speaks dishonestly of how the former leader of French Maoism Robert Linhart “chose” silence. He “chose” silence if a mutism resulting from having gone mad is a choice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That Lévy is acting in bad faith is proved in large ways and small. His insistence that Proust’s writing is “kabbalistic” is so divorced from reality as to be worrisome. That Proust's prose is complex and ornate is undeniable, but it is utterly gratuitous to tack the word “kabbalistic” on to it. As proof of the influence –- not of his Jewishness, which is undeniable, but of Judaism on Proust’s masterpiece -- Lévy quotes a letter from the rabid Jew-hater and Proust’s competitor as France’s great 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century writer, Louis-Ferdinand Céline, who asserted that &lt;em&gt;In Search of Lost Time&lt;/em&gt; “is ‘designed’ and ‘built’ like a Talmud.” Céline hated Proust’s writing, and his Jew-hatred was so severe that he even insisted the pope was really a Dutch Jew. Hating Proust, there could be no worse curse he could find for him than to describe his writing as Talmudic, hence nonsensical. Playing fast and loose with his sources, as Lévy is so often wont, he omits this little caveat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most egregiously, Lévy writes that “in all of the world’s democracies, there is a limit condition that, when encountered, appears to cause them to lean toward declaring a state of emergency… That limit… is war.” In Israel, on the other hand, “[f]reedom of opinion and assembly [are] scrupulously respected even in time of war.” In this case only one word is possible to describe Lévy, and that’s &lt;em&gt;khutspe&lt;/em&gt;. Lévy is a vocal defender of the state of emergency in France that, among other things, bans demonstrations. He advocates it, and then mocks France for not being like Israel, which has not imposed such a ban (at least for Jews). He is the boy who kills his parents and then asks for mercy since he’s an orphan.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LEVY IDEALIZES&lt;/strong&gt; Israel, and after speaking of the failures of assimilation in the U.S. and France dares to say that “I know a country that has found a solution to the problem of multiethnicity, not a perfect solution but better than in France or the United States.” The answer, of course, for Lévy is Israel, “where citizens of Arab origin may openly advocate the disappearance of the very state that guarantees them a life that three quarters of them… would not trade at any price for a life in a neighboring state.” Does Lévy truly believe that Israeli Arabs are anything but second-class citizens? And why travel to Israel to find a successful multi-ethnic state? Why does no one ever mention Canada, where for several years the official opposition party was the Parti Québécois, which had as its goal Quebec’s separation from Canada? Canada, which, with little opposition and great warmth, has welcomed refugees from Syria and Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I’ve not even begun to critique the religious section of this book, full of pretentious folderol from a man who neither reads Hebrew nor is a practicing Jew. It is little but bombast and self-promotion. Indeed, &lt;em&gt;The Genius of Judaism&lt;/em&gt; is the work of a man lost in love for his own voice, for his own self, whose media success has enabled him to delude himself that he has something valid to say and, even more, is a providential figure to whom the world needs to pay heed. If the words “I” and “me” were erased from his vocabulary he would be reduced to silence. He is the Donald Trump of philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Somewhere in the middle of the book, Lévy makes the absolutely groundless assertion =– one among thousands –- that “I do not know of a single Jew in the world for whom the presence of Israel is not a promise –- perhaps a promise deferred, but a promise nonetheless.” I look forward to the day I meet BHL, so that he will not only know of, but know a Jew for whom Israel is not a promise. If he’d like, I can provide him with a list of Jews of my acquaintance who also deny Israel is a land of promise. Let him speak for and embarrass himself, but leave the mass of Jews out of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mitchell Abidor&lt;/strong&gt;, a contributing writer
