SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7"><p>In June, 2016, after news broke that the Democratic National Committee had been hacked, a group of prominent computer scientists went on alert. Reports said that the infiltrators were probably Russian, which suggested to most members of the group that one of the country’s intelligence agencies had been involved. They speculated that if the Russians were hacking the Democrats they must be hacking the Republicans, too. “We thought there was no way in the world the Russians would just attack the Democrats,” one of the computer scientists, who asked to be identified only as Max, told me.</p><p>The group was small—a handful of scientists, scattered across the country—and politically diverse. (Max described himself as “a John McCain Republican.”) Its members sometimes worked with law enforcement or for private clients, but mostly they acted as self-appointed guardians of the Internet, trying to thwart hackers and to keep the system clean of malware—software that hackers use to control a computer remotely, or to extract data. “People think the Internet runs on its own,” Max told me. “It doesn’t. We do this to keep the Internet safe.” The hack of the D.N.C. seemed like a pernicious attack on the integrity of the Web, as well as on the American political system. The scientists decided to investigate whether any Republicans had been hacked, too. “We were trying to protect them,” Max said.</p><p>Max’s group began combing the Domain Name System, a worldwide network that acts as a sort of phone book for the Internet, translating easy-to-remember domain names into I.P. addresses, the strings of numbers that computers use to identify one another. Whenever someone goes online—to send an e-mail, to visit a Web site—her device contacts the Domain Name System to locate the computer that it is trying to connect with. Each query, known as a D.N.S. lookup, can be logged, leaving records in a constellation of servers that extends through private companies, public institutions, and universities. Max and his group are part of a community that has unusual access to these records, which are especially useful to cybersecurity experts who work to protect clients from attacks.</p><p>Max and the other computer scientists asked me to withhold their names, out of concern for their privacy and their security. I met with Max and his lawyer repeatedly, and interviewed other prominent computer experts. (Among them were Jean Camp, of Indiana University; Steven Bellovin, of Columbia University; Daniel Kahn Gillmor, of the A.C.L.U.; Richard Clayton, of the University of Cambridge; Matt Blaze, of the University of Pennsylvania; and Paul Vixie, of Farsight Security.) Several of them independently reviewed the records that Max’s group had discovered and confirmed that they would be difficult to fake. A senior aide on Capitol Hill, who works in national security, said that Max’s research is widely respected among experts in computer science and cybersecurity.</p><p>As Max and his colleagues searched D.N.S. logs for domains associated with Republican candidates, they were perplexed by what they encountered. “We went looking for fingerprints similar to what was on the D.N.C. computers, but we didn’t find what we were looking for,” Max told me. “We found something totally different—something unique.” In the small town of Lititz, Pennsylvania, a domain linked to the Trump Organization (mail1.trump-email.com) seemed to be behaving in a peculiar way. The server that housed the domain belonged to a company called Listrak, which mostly helped deliver mass-marketing e-mails: blasts of messages advertising spa treatments, Las Vegas weekends, and other enticements. Some Trump Organization domains sent mass e-mail blasts, but the one that Max and his colleagues spotted appeared not to be sending anything. At the same time, though, a very small group of companies seemed to be trying to communicate with it.</p><p>Examining records for the Trump domain, Max’s group discovered D.N.S. lookups from a pair of servers owned by Alfa Bank, one of the largest banks in Russia. Alfa Bank’s computers were looking up the address of the Trump server nearly every day. There were dozens of lookups on some days and far fewer on others, but the total number was notable: between May and September, Alfa Bank looked up the Trump Organization’s domain more than two thousand times. “We were watching this happen in real time—it was like watching an airplane fly by,” Max said. “And we thought, Why the hell is a Russian bank communicating with a server that belongs to the Trump Organization, and at such a rate?”</p><div id="cns-ads-slot-type-article-body-0" class="cns-ads-stage cns-ads-slot-type-article-body cns-ads-slot-type-article-body-0" data-name="article_body_0" data-slot-type="article_body" style="font-size: 0px; line-height: 0; overflow: hidden;"><div id="article_body_0" class="cns-ads-container" data-ad-seq="0" style="margin: 0px auto; box-sizing: content-box;"></div></div><p>Only one other entity seemed to be reaching out to the Trump Organization’s domain with any frequency: Spectrum Health, of Grand Rapids, Michigan. Spectrum Health is closely linked to the DeVos family; Richard DeVos, Jr., is the chairman of the board, and one of its hospitals is named after his mother. His wife, <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https://www.newyorker.com/tag/betsy-devos">Betsy DeVos</a>, was appointed Secretary of Education by <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a>. Her brother, Erik Prince, is a Trump associate who has attracted the scrutiny of <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https://www.newyorker.com/tag/robert-mueller">Robert Mueller</a>, the special counsel investigating Trump’s ties to Russia. Mueller has been looking into Prince’s meeting, following the election, with a Russian official in the Seychelles, at which he reportedly discussed setting up a back channel between Trump and the Russian President, Vladimir Putin. (Prince maintains that the meeting was “incidental.”) In the summer of 2016, Max and the others weren’t aware of any of this. “We didn’t know who DeVos was,” Max said.</p><p>The D.N.S. records<span data-page="page_2"></span> raised vexing questions. Why was the Trump Organization’s domain, set up to send mass-marketing e-mails, conducting such meagre activity? And why were computers at Alfa Bank and Spectrum Health trying to reach a server that didn’t seem to be doing anything? After analyzing the data, Max said, “We decided this was a covert communication channel.”</p><div id="cne-interlude-1" data-cne-interlude=""><div><style>#cne-interlude-1 .cne-interlude-container {

But the question of whether Max’s conclusion was correct remains enormously consequential. Was this evidence of an illicit connection between Russia and the Trump campaign? Or was it merely a coincidence, cyber trash, that fed suspicions in a dark time?</p></div><div class="SectionBreak SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7"><p>In August, 2016, Max decided to reveal the data that he and his colleagues had assembled. “If the covert communications were real, this potential threat to our country needed to be known before the election,” he said. After some discussion, he and his lawyer decided to hand over the findings to Eric Lichtblau, of the <em class="">Times</em>. Lichtblau met with Max, and began to look at the data.</p><p>Lichtblau had done breakthrough reporting on National Security Agency surveillance, and he knew that Max’s findings would require sophisticated analysis. D.N.S. lookups are metadata—records that indicate computer interactions but don’t necessarily demonstrate human communication. Lichtblau shared the data with three leading computer scientists, and, like Max, they were struck by the unusual traffic on the server. As Lichtblau talked to experts, he became increasingly convinced that the data suggested a substantive connection. “Not only is there clearly something there but there’s clearly something that someone has gone to great lengths to conceal,” he told me. Jean Camp, of Indiana University, had also vetted some of the data. “These people who should not be communicating are clearly communicating,” she said. In order to encourage discussion among analysts, Camp posted a portion of the raw data on her Web site.</p><p>As Lichtblau wrote a draft of an article for the <em class="">Times</em>, Max’s lawyer contacted the F.B.I. to alert agents that a story about Trump would be running in a national publication, and to pass along the data. A few days later, an F.B.I. official called Lichtblau and asked him to come to the Bureau’s headquarters, in Washington, D.C.</p><div id="cns-ads-slot-type-article-body-1" class="cns-ads-stage cns-ads-slot-type-article-body cns-ads-slot-type-article-body-1" data-name="article_body_1" data-slot-type="article_body" style="font-size: 0px; line-height: 0; overflow: hidden;"><div id="article_body_1" class="cns-ads-container" data-ad-seq="1" style="margin: 0px auto; box-sizing: content-box;"></div></div><p>At the meeting, in late September, 2016, a roomful of officials told Lichtblau that they were looking into potential Russian interference in the election. According to a source who was briefed on the investigation, the Bureau had intelligence from informants suggesting a possible connection between the Trump Organization and Russian banks, but no data. The information from Max’s group could be a significant advance. “The F.B.I. was looking for people in the United States who were helping Russia to influence the election,” the source said. “It was very important to the Bureau. It was urgent.”</p><p>The F.B.I. officials asked Lichtblau to delay publishing his story, saying that releasing the news could jeopardize their investigation. As the story sat, Dean Baquet, the <em class="">Times</em>’ executive editor, decided that it would not suffice to report the existence of computer contacts without knowing their purpose. Lichtblau disagreed, arguing that his story contained important news: that the F.B.I. had opened a counterintelligence investigation into Russian contacts with Trump’s aides. “It was a really tense debate,” Baquet told me. “If I were the reporter, I would have wanted to run it, too. It felt like there was something there.” But, with the election looming, Baquet thought that he could not publish the story without being more confident in its conclusions.</p><p>Over time, the F.B.I.’s interest in the possibility of an Alfa Bank connection seemed to wane. An agency official told Lichtblau that there could be an innocuous explanation for the computer traffic. Then, on October 30th, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid wrote a letter to James Comey, the director of the F.B.I., charging that the Bureau was withholding information about “close ties and coordination” between the Trump campaign and Russia. “We had a window,” Lichtblau said. His <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/01/us/politics/fbi-russia-election-donald-trump.html" target="_blank">story</a> about Alfa Bank ran the next day. But it bore only a modest resemblance to what he had filed. The headline— “<em class="small">Investigating Donald Trump, F.B.I. Sees No Clear Link to Russia</em>”—seemed to exonerate the Trump campaign. And, though the article mentioned the server, it omitted any reference to the computer scientists who had told Lichtblau that the Trump Organization and Alfa Bank might have been communicating. “We were saying that the investigation was basically over—and it was just beginning,” Lichtblau told me.</p><p>That same day, Slate ran a <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/cover_story/2016/10/was_a_server_registered_to_the_trump_organization_communicating_with_russia.html" target="_blank">story</a>, by Franklin Foer, that made a detailed case for the possibility of a covert link between Alfa Bank and Trump. Foer’s report was based largely on information from a colleague of Max’s who called himself Tea Leaves. Foer quoted several outside experts; most said that there appeared to be no other plausible explanation for the data.</p><p>One remarkable aspect of Foer’s story involved the way that the Trump domain had stopped working. On September 21st, he wrote, the <em class="">Times</em> had delivered potential evidence of communications to B.G.R., a Washington lobbying firm that worked for Alfa Bank. Two days later, the Trump domain vanished from the Internet. (Technically, its “A record,” which translates the domain name to an I.P. address, was deleted. If the D.N.S. is a phone book, the domain name was effectively decoupled from its number.) For four days, the servers at Alfa Bank kept<span data-page="page_3"></span> trying to look up the Trump domain. Then, ten minutes after the last attempt, one of them looked up another domain, which had been configured to lead to the same Trump Organization server.</p><div class="bxc bx-base bx-custom bx-active-step-1 bx-campaign-811003 bx-width-full bx-type-agilityzone bx-has-close-x-1 bx-has-close- bx-fx-fade" id="bx-campaign-811003" style="display: none;

On Inauguration Day, Liz Spayd, the <em class="">Times</em>’ ombudsman, published a <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/20/public-editor/trump-russia-fbi-liz-spayd-public-editor.html" target="_blank">column</a> criticizing the paper’s handling of stories related to Trump and Russia, including the Alfa Bank connection. “The Times was too timid in its decisions not to publish the material it had,” she wrote. Spayd’s article did not sit well with Baquet. “It was a bad column,” he told the <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2017/01/21/nyts-dean-baquet-rips-fairly-ridiculous-conclusion-in-public-editors-column-on-russia-coverage/?utm_term=.ad3be3bad583" target="_blank">Washington <em class="">Post</em></a>. Spayd argued that Slate had acted correctly by publishing a more aggressive story, which Baquet dismissed as a “fairly ridiculous conclusion.” That June, Spayd’s job was eliminated, as the paper’s publisher said that the position of ombudsman had become outdated in the digital age. When I talked to Baquet recently, he still felt that he had been right to resist discussing the server in greater depth, but he acknowledged that the <em class="">Times</em> had been too quick to disclaim the possibility of Trump’s connections to Russia. “The story was written too knowingly,” he said. “The headline was flawed. We didn’t know then what we know now.”</p><p>In April, 2017, Lichtblau left the <em class="">Times</em>, after fifteen years—in part, he said, because of the way that the Alfa Bank story was handled. He went to work for CNN, but resigned less than two months later, amid controversy over another story that he had worked on, about the Trump aide Anthony Scaramucci. This April, Lichtblau returned to the <em class="">Times</em> newsroom for a celebration: he had been part of a team of <em class="">Times</em> reporters that was awarded a Pulitzer Prize for its work on other aspects of the Trump campaign. “It was quite a year,” he said.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Trump-Alfa Bank story seemed to fade. The Trump campaign dismissed any connection, saying, “The only covert server is the one Hillary Clinton recklessly established in her basement.” Bloggers and tech journalists assailed the Slate piece online. The cybersecurity researcher Robert Graham called the analysis “nonsense,” and complained, “This is why we can’t have nice things on the Internet.” He pointed out several problems. For instance, Foer’s sources had found that the Trump domain was blocking incoming e-mail, and argued that this was evidence that Trump and Alfa Bank were maintaining a private communications network; in fact, Listrak routinely configured its marketing servers to send e-mail but not to receive it. Graham also noted that the domain was administered not by Trump but by Cendyn, a company in Boca Raton that handled his company’s marketing e-mail.</p><p>Alfa Bank hired two cybersecurity firms, Mandiant and Stroz Friedberg, to review the data. Both firms reported that they had found no evidence of communications with the Trump Organization. The bank also began trying to uncover the anonymous sources in the Slate piece. Attorneys representing Alfa contacted Jean Camp, telling her that they were considering legal action and asking her to identify the researchers who had assembled the data. She declined to reveal their names. “This is what tenure is for,” she told me.</p></div><div class="SectionBreak SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7"><p>Alfa Bank was founded by Mikhail Fridman, in the last years of the Soviet Union. Fridman was born in western Ukraine and studied metallurgy in college. Like many others of his generation, he was introduced to the market economy through hustle. He sold theatre tickets, washed windows, and ran a student discothèque. After the Soviet Union collapsed, in 1991, Fridman joined the scramble to befriend members of the new government and amass a fortune with help from the state. Along with an economist named Petr Aven, who had previously served as the country’s minister for foreign economic relations, Fridman built Alfa Bank into one of the most successful businesses in the new Russia. Its parent company, Alfa Group, now controls the country’s largest private bank, along with financial institutions in several European nations.</p><p>Fridman and Aven acquired reputations as brilliant, relentless businessmen. Describing the lawless post-Soviet years to the journalist Chrystia Freeland, who is now the foreign minister of Canada, Fridman said, “We were absolute savages.” In a notorious episode in 2008, a group of Russian companies, including Alfa Group, tried to gain control of a joint venture they’d formed with British Petroleum. The power struggle was so fierce that the C.E.O. of the joint venture, Robert Dudley, felt compelled to leave Russia. The oligarchs kept pushing for control of the BP venture until it was sold to a state-owned petroleum company, for fifty-five billion dollars; Alfa Group’s cut was almost fourteen billion.</p><div id="cns-ads-slot-type-article-body-3" class="cns-ads-stage cns-ads-slot-type-article-body cns-ads-slot-type-article-body-3" data-name="article_body_3" data-slot-type="article_body" style="font-size: 0px; line-height: 0; overflow: hidden;"><div id="article_body_3" class="cns-ads-container" data-ad-seq="3" style="margin: 0px auto; box-sizing: content-box;"></div></div><p>Alfa Bank prospered during the Yeltsin years and has continued to do so under Putin. Though Fridman and Aven are not part of Putin’s innermost circle, they have managed to avoid the fate of some other oligarchs, who have had assets seized and, in a few cases, been imprisoned, after falling out of favor. Michael McFaul, a former U.S.<span data-page="page_4"></span> Ambassador to Russia, told me he was impressed that Fridman and Aven had “navigated the very difficult world of maintaining their private business interests and not crossing the Kremlin.”</p><p>One reason the server story alarmed Alfa Bank was that it threatened the bank’s standing in Washington. Members of Russia’s government and many of its businessmen have been under American economic sanctions since 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea, but Alfa’s principals and representatives have enjoyed access to U.S. politicians at the highest levels. Fridman and Aven met several times with officials at the Obama White House, discussing such issues as Russia’s effort to gain entrance to the World Trade Organization. (Alfa Bank maintains that it has “never advocated for political or trade issues on behalf of the Russian government.”) “Fridman and Aven were seen as people that Washington could talk to about U.S.-Russia, because they checked two boxes—they were ‘polite company’ oligarchs, and they could shed light on Putin’s intentions and perspective,” a senior official in the Obama Administration told me. “They got meetings at State and on the Hill and at the White House. And they were understood to be operating with the consent and guidance of Vladimir Putin.”</p><p>Alfa is still closely tied to the Russian system, but Fridman and Aven live much of the time in the United Kingdom. If there was a communications link with the Trump Organization, it might have been created without their knowledge. According to experts I spoke to, large Russian companies typically have a member of the intelligence services, either active or retired, working at a senior level. If a company’s services are required in some way, the officer—called a <em class="">kurator</em>—coördinates them. “A company couldn’t say no,” a Washington-based Russia expert told me. (When asked about this, an Alfa Bank spokesperson said, “To our knowledge there are no senior intelligence officials at senior levels at Alfa Bank.”)</p><p>This past May, I saw Petr Aven in New York, at the Four Seasons Hotel. He had just come from a dinner in Washington, at which he had met a group of prominent Americans, including officials from the White House, to discuss Russia’s economic situation. Aven seemed worried about surveillance; before we sat down, he brought his phone to the other side of the lobby and hid it behind a plant. He wouldn’t say much for the record, but he told me that his bank didn’t have “any connection at all with Trump—nothing.”</p><p>Aven and Fridman have visited Washington less often since Trump took office. But Trump’s victory appeared to elevate Alfa Bank’s connections there—at least by association. Don McGahn, the White House counsel, came from Jones Day, one of the law firms that represent Alfa Bank in the United States. McGahn brought five Jones Day lawyers with him into the White House; six more were appointed to senior posts in the Administration. Jones Day has done work for businesses belonging to a long list of Russian oligarchs, including Oleg Deripaska, Viktor Vekselberg, and Alexander Mashkevich. The firm has also represented the Trump campaign in its dealings with Robert Mueller. For this reason, McGahn secured an ethics waiver that allows him to talk to his old firm when its clients have business before the U.S. government.</p><p>In June, 2017, Trump nominated Brian Benczkowski, a lawyer who had overseen the Stroz Friedberg report for Alfa Bank, to lead the criminal division of the Justice Department. At his confirmation hearing, Benczkowski said emphatically that Stroz Friedberg, like Mandiant, had rejected the possibility of complicity. The investigation, he said, found that “there was no communications link between the Trump Organization and Alfa Bank.”</p><div id="cns-ads-slot-type-article-body-4" class="cns-ads-stage cns-ads-slot-type-article-body cns-ads-slot-type-article-body-4" data-name="article_body_4" data-slot-type="article_body" style="font-size: 0px; line-height: 0; overflow: hidden;"><div id="article_body_4" class="cns-ads-container" data-ad-seq="4" style="margin: 0px auto; box-sizing: content-box;"></div></div><p>Democratic senators expressed concern that Benczkowski had taken on work for Alfa Bank; he had been a senior member of Trump’s transition team and had good reason to expect that he would be appointed to a job in the Administration. “The client was a Russian bank that is under suspicion of having a direct connection with the Trump campaign,” Senator Richard Durbin said, during the hearing.</p><p>He and the other Democratic senators were especially troubled that Benczkowski would not commit to recusing himself from dealing with Mueller’s investigation, even though he had worked for two of Russia’s leading oligarchs. “Why did you refuse to recuse yourself?” Senator Dianne Feinstein asked.</p><p>“I don’t know what’s in Special Prosecutor Mueller’s investigation,” Benczkowski said. “I’m a lawyer in private practice. I have no idea what he’s up to, other than what I read in the papers.”</p><div id="RecircCarousel" class="recircCarouselUnit RecirculationCarousel__carousel___3oV_x" style="display: none;"><p class="RecirculationCarousel__hedPre___ejDzX">MORE FROM THIS ISSUE</p><p class="RecirculationCarousel__hed___3RfXw"><a href="/magazine/2018/10/15" class="recircCarouselUnit">October 15, 2018</a></p><div class="RecirculationCarousel__slidesContainer___2DapU"><div class="RecirculationCarousel__arrowsContainer___1wE7z"><button class="Button__button___2vDCa Button__primary___2l6wB  recircCarouselUnit RecirculationCarousel__arrow___Jn-9M RecirculationCarousel__topArrow___1kb1M" disabled=""><div class="Button__content___d_gRZ"><i class="Button__icon___x9PXG Button__left___27AnT "><svg width="9" height="15" viewBox="0 0 9 15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M3.3 7L9 1.5 7.6 0l-7 7 7 7L9 12.8 3.3 7z" fill-rule="evenodd"/></svg></i></div></button><button class="Button__button___2vDCa Button__primary___2l6wB  recircCarouselUnit RecirculationCarousel__arrow___Jn-9M"><div class="Button__content___d_gRZ"><i class="Button__icon___x9PXG Button__left___27AnT "><svg width="9" height="15" viewBox="0 0 9 15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M5.7 8L0 13.5 1.4 15l7-7-7-7L0 2.2 5.7 8z" fill-rule="evenodd"/></svg></i></div></button></div><div class="slick-initialized slick-slider"><div class="slick-list"><div class="slick-track" style="opacity: 1;

After Trump’s Inauguration, two Democratic senators who had reviewed the data assembled by Max’s group—Mark Warner and a colleague who requested anonymity—asked the F.B.I. for an assessment of any potential contacts between Alfa Bank and the Trump Organization. The material was also brought to the attention of the C.I.A., which found it substantial enough to suggest that the F.B.I. investigate. In March, 2017, a Pennsylvania news outlet called Lancaster Online reported that F.B.I. agents had visited the offices of Listrak, the company that housed the Trump server. Ross Kramer, Listrak’s C.E.O., told me, “I gave them everything they asked for.”</p><div id="cns-ads-slot-type-article-body-8" class="cns-ads-stage cns-ads-slot-type-article-body cns-ads-slot-type-article-body-8" data-name="article_body_8" data-slot-type="article_body" style="font-size: 0px; line-height: 0; overflow: hidden;"><div id="article_body_8" class="cns-ads-container" data-ad-seq="8" style="margin: 0px auto; box-sizing: content-box;"></div></div><p>Around the same time,<span data-page="page_5"></span> the second Democratic senator approached a former Senate staffer named Daniel Jones and asked him to give the data a closer look. Jones had served as a counterterrorism investigator for the F.B.I. and then spent ten years working for the Senate Intelligence Committee, where he led the inquiry into the use of torture under the George W. Bush Administration. Now he was running an investigations firm, the Penn Quarter Group, and a nonprofit initiative called the Democracy Integrity Project, which was intended to help keep elections free from foreign interference.</p><p>To assess the Alfa Bank data, Jones assembled a team of computer scientists, divided into two groups, one on each coast. (They also consulted with Jean Camp, who agreed to coöperate despite the possibility that Alfa Bank might take legal action.) All these experts have national reputations in the field. Some have held senior cybersecurity jobs in the Pentagon, the White House, and the intelligence services, as well as in leading American technology companies. In order to encourage an unbiased outcome, Jones never introduced the East Coast group to the West Coast group.</p><p>I met several times with the two members of the East Coast group and spoke with them repeatedly. They used pseudonyms, Paul and Leto, in part because they had been alarmed by encounters with Russia while they were working at high levels of government. Leto said that, in 2016, as he was investigating cyber intrusions that seemed to originate in Russia, he became convinced that he was being followed. Both he and Paul believed that their phones had been hacked. These incursions coincided with a period of intense Russian activity in the U.S., including the hacking of the D.N.C., a pro-Trump <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/10/01/how-russia-helped-to-swing-the-election-for-trump">social-media blitz</a>, and the arrival of Maria Butina, who is accused of being a Russian agent sent to ingratiate herself with American conservative leaders. (Butina has denied the accusations.)</p><p>As Paul and Leto began working, they needed to verify that Max’s data presented an accurate picture of the traffic. After the Slate story appeared, skeptics pointed out that no one has a comprehensive view of the Domain Name System. They speculated that other entities, besides Alfa Bank and Spectrum Health, had looked up the Trump domain, and that Max had failed to see them. The D.N.S. company Dyn told a reporter that it had seen lookups from other computers around the world. But Dyn turned out to have registered only two additional lookups, both from the same address in the Netherlands.</p><p>Max and his colleagues maintain that they are able to see nearly all the D.N.S. lookups on a given domain; the senior Capitol Hill aide I spoke to affirmed that Max’s group is widely understood to have this capability. Paul Vixie, one of the original architects of the D.N.S. network, examined the data and told me, “If this is a forgery, it’s better than any forgery I’ve seen.” Jones’s team also ran analyses and real-time tests to check Max’s access to D.N.S. records. “It’s completely implausible that he could have fooled us,” Paul said.</p><p>Max had provided the Jones team with thirty-seven million D.N.S. records, enough to fill thousands of screens with time stamps and I.P. addresses—long strings of numbers and letters in green type. Over the course of several months, Paul and Leto examined the data for patterns and anomalies. “We stared at a lot of green screens,” Paul said. They regarded their inquiry as a statistical enterprise, capturing each Alfa Bank D.N.S. query from the ocean of data that they had been given and plotting it over a four-month period. Both said that they began their work as skeptics. “I started from an assumption that this is a bunch of nonsense,” Leto told me.</p><div id="cns-ads-slot-type-article-body-9" class="cns-ads-stage cns-ads-slot-type-article-body cns-ads-slot-type-article-body-9" data-name="article_body_9" data-slot-type="article_body" style="font-size: 0px; line-height: 0; overflow: hidden;"><div id="article_body_9" class="cns-ads-container" data-ad-seq="9" style="margin: 0px auto; box-sizing: content-box;"></div></div><p>Much of the information that was publicly available might well have supported that assumption. Foer’s article in Slate had prompted online discussions, in which commentators offered explanations ranging from the benign to the sinister. The timing of the lookups, which came in the summer just before the election, invited speculation. Foer claimed that the biggest flurries of traffic coincided with major campaign events, including the party conventions. Paul and Leto were dubious. If anything, the traffic coincided with Paul Manafort’s time as Trump’s campaign manager—but the D.N.S. queries continued after Manafort stepped down. “A lot of people are seeing faces in clouds,” Leto said.</p><p>The Trump Organization had done little to clarify the matter. In October, 2016, it released a statement denying interactions with Alfa Bank “or any Russian entity.” Instead, it offered a peculiar explanation for the D.N.S. traffic: it had been triggered when “an existing banking customer of Cendyn”—the marketing firm—had used the company’s systems to send communications to Alfa Bank. Such a scenario would be highly irregular; it was as if Gmail had allowed a user to send e-mail from another user’s account. “It makes no sense,” Paul told me.</p><p>Trump’s advocates claimed that the investigations sponsored by Alfa Bank had proved that Alfa and the Trump Organization were not communicating. In fact, they sidestepped the question. Mandiant, one of the cybersecurity firms, said that it was unable to inspect the bank’s D.N.S. logs from 2016, because Alfa retained such records for only twenty-four hours. The other firm, Stroz Friedberg, gave the same explanation for why it, too, was “unable to verify” the data.</p><p>As Jones’s team vetted the data, they examined various possible explanations. One<span data-page="page_6"></span> was malware, which had played a role in the hack of the D.N.C.’s computers. Most malware has “distinctive patterns of behavior,” Camp told me. It is typically sent out in a blast, aimed simultaneously at multiple domains. There is a “payload”—a mechanism that activates the malicious activity—and a “recruitment mechanism,” which enables the malware to take over parts of a vulnerable computer. None of the experts whom Jones assembled found any evidence of this behavior on the Trump server. “Malware doesn’t keep banging on the door like that,” Paul said.</p><p>A second possibility was marketing e-mail. After the Slate article appeared, some commentators suggested that Trump’s server had innocently sent promotional e-mails to Alfa Bank, and that a computer there had responded with queries designed to verify the identity of the sender. This became a catchall answer for anyone who couldn’t explain what had happened. “Either this is something innocuous, like spam,” Rachel Cohen, a press secretary for Senator Warner, told me, “or it’s completely nefarious.”</p><p>Alfa Bank had received Trump marketing e-mails in the past. But Cendyn had told CNN that it stopped sending e-mails for the Trump Organization in March, 2016, before the peculiar activity began; Trump had transferred his online marketing to another company, called Serenata. Jones’s team investigated, and found additional evidence that the server wasn’t sending marketing e-mails at the time. One indicator was the unusually limited traffic. Kramer, of Listrak, told me that a typical client sends “tens of thousands of e-mails a day” to huge numbers of recipients. If the Trump server was following that pattern, it would have generated significant D.N.S. traffic. To establish a kind of control group, Jones’s team asked Max to capture the D.N.S. logs for the Denihan Hospitality Group—a hotel chain, similar in size to Trump’s, which was using Cendyn and Listrak to send marketing e-mails. In a sample spanning August and September, 2016, a Denihan domain received more than twenty thousand D.N.S. queries, from more than a thousand I.P. addresses. In the same period, the Trump domain had twenty-five hundred lookups, nearly all of them from Alfa Bank and Spectrum Health.</p><div id="cns-ads-slot-type-article-body-10" class="cns-ads-stage cns-ads-slot-type-article-body cns-ads-slot-type-article-body-10" data-name="article_body_10" data-slot-type="article_body" style="font-size: 0px; line-height: 0; overflow: hidden;"><div id="article_body_10" class="cns-ads-container" data-ad-seq="10" style="margin: 0px auto; box-sizing: content-box;"></div></div><p>The timing and the frequency of the D.N.S. lookups also did not suggest spam, Paul and Leto believed. Mass-marketing e-mails are typically sent by an automated process, one after another, in an unbroken rhythm. The Alfa queries seemed to fall into two categories. Some came in a steady pulse, while others arrived irregularly—sometimes many in a day, sometimes a few. “The timing of the communication was not random, and it wasn’t regular-periodic,” Paul said. “It was a better match for human activity.”</p><p>But, if the Trump server wasn’t sending or receiving e-mail, what could explain the traffic? There was the possibility of “spoofing”—essentially, faking an identity. Did someone try to make it appear, falsely, that Alfa Bank was reaching out to the Trump Organization? Jones’s team concluded that such an attack would have been unlikely to produce thousands of D.N.S. lookups, over such a long time. “Maybe for a few days, but not four months,” Leto said. There was also a question of motive. In the spring of 2016, very few people knew that Max and his colleagues were able to monitor D.N.S. traffic so comprehensively, so any spoofers would have been impersonating Alfa Bank with little expectation of being detected. News stories investigating the links between Trump and Russia were months away. “Why would someone do that?” Steven Bellovin, of Columbia, said. “And why would they pick those organizations?”</p></div><div class="SectionBreak SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7"><p>When I saw Petr Aven at the Four Seasons, he argued that the connections with the Trump Organization had been fabricated in order to frame his company. “This is a conspiracy against us,” he told me. “It is really much bigger than the computers.” Aven did not elaborate, but Jeffrey Birnbaum, a spokesperson for Alfa Bank, supplied more detail. The bank, he said, suspected that “we are victims of classic Russian <em class="">kompromat</em>—a well-known scam in which Russian competitors pay analysts to write false reports to damage reputations.” Birnbaum described the press inquiries into the matter as an extended affliction. “This has been a terrible ordeal for Alfa Bank, like living through a Kafka novel,” he said. (Max rejected the idea that his group had fabricated data. “If we were going to lie, then we would have made up a much better story than this!” he said.)</p><div class="Callout__inset-left___2rZjf" data-type="callout" data-callout="inset-left"><div class="CartoonEmbed__container___vf5AM "><a class="Link__link___3dWao CartoonEmbed__captionLink___14pNW " href="https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a21955"><figure class="Figure__figure___U_9Te  "><div class="placeholder"><div class="placeholder-buttress"></div><div class="placeholder-content"><div class="Image__image___1PhYl" role="button" tabindex="0"><div class="component-lazy pending" data-component="Lazy"></div></div></div></div><figcaption class="ImageCaption__captionWrapper___2h5XI Figure__cartoonCaptionWrapper___1tdkA ImageCaption__default___3TPB5"><span class="ImageCaption__caption___1EOQO ImageCaption__caption___1EOQO">“Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down twenty-two dollars and thirty-seven cents.”</span></figcaption></figure></a><div class="CartoonEmbed__socialWrapper___3-ICo"><div class="SocialShare__socialShare___92Ene SocialShare__grey___dItUm CartoonEmbed__socialShare___13L3P"><a class="Link__link___3dWao SocialShare__link___Sad7k SocialShare__facebook___Jm71k " rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" data-track-type="socialShare" data-track-location="cartoon" data-source="facebook" href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fcartoon%2Fa21955&amp;display=popup&amp;ref=plugin"></a><a class="Link__link___3dWao SocialShare__link___Sad7k SocialShare__twitter___3O6QA " rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" data-track-type="socialShare" data-track-location="cartoon" data-source="twitter" href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?original_referer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fcartoon%2Fa21955&amp;text=A%20New%20Yorker%20Cartoon&amp;tw_p=tweetbutton&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fcartoon%2Fa21955"></a><a class="Link__link___3dWao SocialShare__link___Sad7k SocialShare__email___TlCif " rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" data-track-type="socialShare" data-track-location="cartoon" data-source="email" href="mailto:?subject=From%20newyorker.com:%20A%20New%20Yorker%20Cartoon&amp;body=%E2%80%9CRapunzel%2C%20Rapunzel%2C%20let%20down%20twenty-two%20dollars%20and%20thirty-seven%20cents.%E2%80%9D%0D%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fcartoon%2Fa21955"></a><a class="Link__link___3dWao CartoonEmbed__shop___1TDi0 " rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" data-track-type="shop" data-track-location="cartoon-shop" href="https://condenaststore.com/conde-nast-brand/cartoonbank"></a></div></div></div></div><p>Because Alfa Bank did not retain its D.N.S. logs (many large companies don’t), its assessments of what produced the lookups in early 2016 are necessarily speculative. “We are as mystified as anybody about these false allegations,” Birnbaum told me this September. In a series of exchanges over three weeks, he offered a range of possibilities. He suggested that the data had been faked, but also that they had been stolen from the bank’s logs. He attributed the traffic to <em class="">kompromat</em>, but also expounded a scenario in which it had been caused by a technical glitch: Trump e-mails “hidden” in the system were intermittently processed by the bank’s security software, an application called Trend Micro Deep Discovery Inspector. In this explanation, Trump marketing e-mails from before March, 2016, had made it through the spam filter and been stored in a permanent archive, where the bank backs up all its e-mail. Periodically, the bank re-scanned that archive, as updates to the security software provided new information about<span data-page="page_7"></span> which senders might be unsafe. During scans, the system performed D.N.S. lookups for every domain name contained in every e-mail. In the course of several months, the bank said, this could account for the traffic.</p><p>The experts I spoke to confirmed that this was a technically plausible, if highly inefficient, way to configure security software. But the explanation raised questions of its own. Alfa Bank said that its scans ran for two days after each update. But Max’s data don’t show a consistent pattern of two-day spikes. Another concern lay in the chronology. The bank had received e-mails from the Trump domain in late 2015 and early 2016, which should have triggered lookups. But, according to the data, the lookups didn’t begin until May, 2016. In response to a question about this discrepancy, Birnbaum said that the Trend Micro software had not been “fully integrated” until March—but that wouldn’t account for the time between March and May.</p><p>A third problem was that, if Alfa Bank wasn’t receiving new e-mails from the Trump Organization after March, 2016, then the number of Trump e-mails in the archive—and thus the number of lookups—should have remained steady through the summer. But Max’s data showed a different pattern: no lookups in the spring, a small number in May, and then a slow increase starting in June, with spikes that lasted until the system went offline. When asked about the increase, Birnbaum offered another refinement of the explanation. The bank had previously said that the software had performed checks of old e-mails “multiple times over the six-month period.” Now he said that a security update “around August” had caused old e-mails to be re-scanned.</p><div id="cns-ads-slot-type-article-body-11" class="cns-ads-stage cns-ads-slot-type-article-body cns-ads-slot-type-article-body-11" data-name="article_body_11" data-slot-type="article_body" style="font-size: 0px; line-height: 0; overflow: hidden;"><div id="article_body_11" class="cns-ads-container" data-ad-seq="11" style="margin: 0px auto; box-sizing: content-box;"></div></div><p>In any case, for an explanation of this kind to work, it would require the servers at Spectrum Health to be simultaneously experiencing the same glitch, or another one with similar effects. (Spectrum declined to answer questions about its computer systems.) Trend Micro has thousands of users, most of them businesses, but in the sample that Max and his colleagues could see, only Alfa Bank and Spectrum Health exhibited this peculiar behavior.</p><p>For some, the most baffling part of the puzzle was the way that the lookups stopped. The Trump domain vanished from the Web on the morning of Friday, September 23rd, two days after the <em class="">Times</em> presented its data to B.G.R., Alfa Bank’s lobbyists in Washington, but before it called Trump or Cendyn. In Max’s view, this was evidence of direct contact between Alfa Bank and Trump. One researcher whom Foer interviewed put it vividly: “The knee was hit in Moscow, the leg kicked in New York.” There is, however, at least one possibility that doesn’t involve Moscow: the lobbyists in Washington could have passed along a warning to Trump, as a courtesy. But B.G.R. denies doing this, calling the idea “ridiculous on its face.”</p><p>Whatever the reason that the Trump domain vanished, Alfa Bank’s servers continued trying to look it up: Max’s group observed fifteen failed attempts that Friday, twenty-eight on Saturday, none on Sunday, ninety on Monday, twenty on Tuesday. Spectrum Health’s machine kept trying, too, in a weeklong spasm of activity that entailed thousands of seemingly automated lookups. Spectrum never succeeded in relocating the Trump server—but Alfa did. On the night of Tuesday, September 27th, ten minutes after the bank made its last failed attempt, it looked up the domain name trump1.contact-client.com—which was, it turned out, another route to the same Trump server.</p><p>The alternative domain name does not appear to have been previously active; no one has produced an e-mail sent from it. So how did Alfa find it? The easiest method would have been by consulting a <em class="small">PTR</em> record, which shows what domain names are associated with a given I.P. address. But the <em class="small">PTR</em> record for the Trump address did not include the alternative name.</p><p>Birnbaum said that Alfa Bank’s researchers, investigating the traffic, found the new name in other public records and then performed a test lookup. Vixie said that such a lookup would be unusual, and questioned why the bank would feel that it was necessary: “Why did Alfa look up either name? And especially the second name?”</p><p>According to Max’s data, Alfa Bank looked up the new domain name only once. In the following months, he and his group stopped collecting data on the Trump Organization domains. After the Slate story came out, curious readers looked up the address thousands of times, and the D.N.S. traffic devolved into statistical noise. The Trump Organization now controls the original domain; in March, 2017, Cendyn told CNN that it had been “transferred back.” Records show that Cendyn handed over the domain only a few days before the CNN story ran—a year after the last e-mail was sent from it. Jones’s team believed that Cendyn had continued its relationship with the Trump Organization in 2016. “There were thousands of e-mails between Trump and Cendyn through the entire period that Alfa Bank was looking up the Trump server,” Max told me. Cendyn said that this was “regular business correspondence,” related to transferring back the domain. When I called the company’s C.E.O., Richard Deyo, to ask more broadly about the situation, he said, “This is old news—that’s just Internet traffic,” and then hung up. A spokesperson for Serenata, which took over Trump’s hotel marketing, told me that the company had nothing to say. “Don’t call again,” she<span data-page="page_8"></span> said.</p><div id="cns-ads-slot-type-article-body-12" class="cns-ads-stage cns-ads-slot-type-article-body cns-ads-slot-type-article-body-12" data-name="article_body_12" data-slot-type="article_body" style="font-size: 0px; line-height: 0; overflow: hidden;"><div id="article_body_12" class="cns-ads-container" data-ad-seq="12" style="margin: 0px auto; box-sizing: content-box;"></div></div></div><div class="SectionBreak SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7"><p>As Jones’s team sifted through explanations for the traffic, they began constructing their own theory. “What you have here is a minimally viable technical footprint of a small number of people who are using what I suspect is an ad-hoc system to communicate,” Paul said. “Anytime the F.B.I. or anyone else pulls apart a cyber-crime organization, there is always some communication structure that’s used for command and control. That’s where the high-value communications happen.” (Max and his colleagues did not see any D.N.S. evidence that the Trump Organization was attempting to access the server; they speculated that the organization was using a virtual private network, or V.P.N., a common security measure that obscures users’ digital footprints.)</p><p>If this was a communications mechanism, it appeared to have been relatively simple, suggesting that it had been set up spontaneously and refined over time. Because the Trump Organization did not have administrative control of the server, Paul and Leto theorized that any such system would have incorporated software that one of the parties was already using. “The likely scenario is not that the people using the server were incredibly sophisticated networking geniuses doing something obscure and special,” Max said. “The likely scenario is that they adapted a server and vender already available to them, which they felt was away from prying eyes.” Leto told me that he envisioned “something like a bulletin-board system.” Or it could have been an instant-messaging system that was part of software already in use on the server.</p><p>Kramer, of Listrak, insisted that his company’s servers were used exclusively for mass marketing. “We only do one thing here,” he told me. But Listrak’s services can be integrated with numerous Cendyn software packages, some of which allow instant messaging. One possibility is Metron, used to manage events at hotels. In fact, the Trump Organization’s October, 2016, statement, blaming the unusual traffic on a “banking customer” of Cendyn, suggested that the communications had gone through Metron, which supports both messaging and e-mail.</p><p>The parties might also have been using Webmail—e-mail that leaves few digital traces, other than D.N.S. lookups. Or, Paul and Leto said, they could have been communicating through software used to compose marketing e-mails. They might have used a method called foldering, in which messages are written but not sent; instead, they are saved in a drafts folder, where an accomplice who also has access to the account can read them. “This is a very common way for people to communicate with each other who don’t want to be detected,” Leto told me. David Petraeus, when he was the director of the C.I.A., used this method to exchange intimacies—and to share classified information—with his lover, Paula Broadwell. In June, an attorney for the Mueller investigation accused Paul Manafort of using foldering to facilitate secret communications.</p><p>Given the limitations of D.N.S. data, none of the independent experts I spoke to could be certain of what Alfa Bank and the Trump Organization were doing. Some of them cautioned that it was impossible even to guess at every way that an e-mail system might malfunction. A senior analyst at a D.N.S.-service provider said, “Things can get messed up in unexpected ways.” But Paul and Leto maintained that they had considered and rejected every scenario that they had encountered in decades of cybersecurity work. “Is it possible there is an innocuous explanation for all this?” Paul said. “Yes, of course. And it’s also possible that space aliens did this. It’s possible—just not very likely.”</p></div><div class="SectionBreak SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7"><p>Paul and Leto periodically went back to Max in the course of their research, interrogating his assumptions and asking for more information. In one tranche of data that he gave them, they noticed that a third entity, in addition to Alfa Bank and Spectrum Health, had been looking up the Trump domain: Heartland Payment Systems, a payments processor based in Princeton. Of the thirty-five hundred D.N.S. queries seen for the Trump domain, Heartland made only seventy-six—but no other visible entity made more than two. Heartland had a link to Alfa Bank, but a tenuous one. It had recently been acquired by Global Payments, which, in 2009, had paid seventy-five million dollars for United Card Services, Russia’s leading credit-card-processing company; two years later, United Card Services bought Alfa Bank’s credit-card-processing unit. (A spokesperson for Global Payments said that her company had never had any relationship with the Trump Organization or with Alfa Bank, and that its U.S. and Russia operations functioned entirely independently.)</p><div id="cns-ads-slot-type-article-body-13" class="cns-ads-stage cns-ads-slot-type-article-body cns-ads-slot-type-article-body-13" data-name="article_body_13" data-slot-type="article_body" style="font-size: 0px; line-height: 0; overflow: hidden;"><div id="article_body_13" class="cns-ads-container" data-ad-seq="13" style="margin: 0px auto; box-sizing: content-box;"></div></div><p>Spectrum Health has a similarly indirect business tie to Alfa Bank. Richard DeVos’ father co-founded Amway, and his brother, Doug, has served as the company’s president since 2002. In 2014, Amway joined with Alfa Bank to create an “Alfa-Amway” loyalty-card program in Russia. But such connections are circumstantial at best; the DeVos family seems far more clearly linked to Trump than to Russia.</p><p>If Trump and Alfa Bank—as well as Spectrum Health and Heartland Payment Systems—were communicating, what might they have been talking about? Max and some of the other scientists I spoke to theorized that they may have been using the system to signal one another about events or tasks that had to be performed: money to be transferred, for instance, or data to be copied. “My guess is that, whenever someone wanted to talk, they would do a D.N.S. lookup and then route the traffic somewhere else,” Richard Clayton, of the University<span data-page="page_final"></span> of Cambridge, said. Camp also speculated that the system may have been used to coördinate the movement of data. She noted that Cambridge Analytica, which was working for the Trump campaign, took millions of personal records from Facebook. In Camp’s scenario, these could have been transferred to the Russian government, to help guide its targeting of American voters before the election.</p><p>The researchers I spoke with were careful to point out that the limits of D.N.S. data prevent them from going beyond speculation. If employees of the companies were talking, the traffic reveals nothing about who they were or what they were saying; it is difficult to rule out something as banal as a protracted game of video poker. “If I’m a cop, I’m not going to take this to the D.A. and say we’re ready to prosecute,” Leto said. “I’m going to say we have enough to ask for a search warrant.” More complete information could be difficult to obtain. This March, after Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee announced that it had found no evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, the committee’s Democrats filed a dissent, arguing that there were many matters still to be investigated, including the Trump Organization’s connections to Alfa Bank. The Democrats implored the majority to force Cendyn to turn over computer data that would help determine what had happened. Those records could show who in the Trump Organization used the server. There would probably also be a record of who shut down the Trump domain after the <em class="">Times</em> contacted Alfa Bank. Cendyn might have records of any outgoing communications sent by the Trump Organization. But the request for further investigation is unlikely to proceed as long as Republicans hold the majority. “We’ve all looked at the data, and it doesn’t look right,” a congressional staffer told me. “But how do you get to the truth?”</p><p>The enigma, for now, remains an enigma. The only people likely to finally resolve the question of Alfa Bank and the Trump Organization are federal investigators. Max told me that no one in his group had been contacted. But, he said, it wasn’t necessary for anyone in the F.B.I. to talk to him, if the agents gathered the right information from other sources, like Listrak and Cendyn. “I hope Mueller has all of it,” he said. ♦</p></div></div></div></div><footer class="ArticleFooter__footer___3-wlJ"><span class="ArticleDisclaimer__articleDisclaimer___2kCNX">This article appears in the print edition of the October 15, 2018, issue, with the headline “Enigma Machines.”</span><div class="ArticleContributors__bio___3XQjk"><div class="ArticleContributors__contributorWrapper___1CrIJ"><ul class="ArticleContributors__contributorBios___3_jrJ ArticleContributors__noAvatar___26vfu"><li><p class="ArticleContributors__contributorBioText___3m1QB">Dexter Filkins joined <em>The New Yorker</em> as a staff writer in 2011.</p><a class="Link__link___3dWao ArticleContributors__contributorBioLink___3ifgZ " href="/contributors/dexter-filkins">Read more »</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="undefined ArticleFooter__adEndArticle___2_iy_" data-cns="cns-slot-end-of-article"><div id="cns-ads-slot-type-ams-nyr-endofarticletout-0" class="cns-ads-stage cns-ads-slot-type-ams-nyr-endofarticletout cns-ads-slot-type-ams-nyr-endofarticletout-0 cns-ads-slot-state-filled cns-ads-slot-size-710x75" data-name="AMS_NYR_ENDOFARTICLETOUT_0" data-slot-type="AMS_NYR_ENDOFARTICLETOUT" style="font-size: 0px; line-height: 0; overflow: hidden;"><div id="AMS_NYR_ENDOFARTICLETOUT_0" class="cns-ads-container" data-ad-seq="0" data-google-query-id="CKG334HGs94CFbIYrQYdzFUL2g" style="margin: 0px auto; box-sizing: content-box; height: 75px; min-height: 75px; width: 710px; min-width: 710px;"><div id="google_ads_iframe_3379/newyorker.cm/magazine/a-reporter-at-large_6__container__" style="border: 0pt none; margin: auto; text-align: center; height: 75px; min-height: 75px; width: 710px; min-width: 710px;"><iframe id="google_ads_iframe_3379/newyorker.cm/magazine/a-reporter-at-large_6" title="3rd party ad content" name="google_ads_iframe_3379/newyorker.cm/magazine/a-reporter-at-large_6" width="710" height="75" scrolling="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" frameborder="0" srcdoc="" style="border: 0px; vertical-align: bottom; height: 75px; min-height: 75px; width: 710px; min-width: 710px;" data-google-container-id="b" data-load-complete="true"></iframe></div></div></div></div><div class=""><form><section class="NewsletterSubscribe__newsletterComponent___1ZI2a"><p class="NewsletterSubscribe__newsletterDek___29WDu">Never miss a big <i>New Yorker</i> story again.

June, 2016, after news broke that the Democratic National Committee had been hacked, a group of prominent computer scientists went on alert. Reports said that the infiltrators were probably Russian, which suggested to most members of the group that one of the country’s intelligence agencies had been involved. They speculated that if the Russians were hacking the Democrats they must be hacking the Republicans, too. “We thought there was no way in the world the Russians would just attack the Democrats,” one of the computer scientists, who asked to be identified only as Max, told me."],["p","The group was small—a handful of scientists, scattered across the country—and politically diverse. (Max described himself as “a John McCain Republican.”) Its members sometimes worked with law enforcement or for private clients, but mostly they acted as self-appointed guardians of the Internet, trying to thwart hackers and to keep the system clean of malware—software that hackers use to control a computer remotely, or to extract data. “People think the Internet runs on its own,” Max told me. “It doesn’t. We do this to keep the Internet safe.” The hack of the D.N.C. seemed like a pernicious attack on the integrity of the Web, as well as on the American political system. The scientists decided to investigate whether any Republicans had been hacked, too. “We were trying to protect them,” Max said."],["p","Max’s group began combing the Domain Name System, a worldwide network that acts as a sort of phone book for the Internet, translating easy-to-remember domain names into I.P. addresses, the strings of numbers that computers use to identify one another. Whenever someone goes online—to send an e-mail, to visit a Web site—her device contacts the Domain Name System to locate the computer that it is trying to connect with. Each query, known as a D.N.S. lookup, can be logged, leaving records in a constellation of servers that extends through private companies, public institutions, and universities. Max and his group are part of a community that has unusual access to these records, which are especially useful to cybersecurity experts who work to protect clients from attacks."],["p","Max and the other computer scientists asked me to withhold their names, out of concern for their privacy and their security. I met with Max and his lawyer repeatedly, and interviewed other prominent computer experts. (Among them were Jean Camp, of Indiana University; Steven Bellovin, of Columbia University; Daniel Kahn Gillmor, of the A.C.L.U.; Richard Clayton, of the University of Cambridge; Matt Blaze, of the University of Pennsylvania; and Paul Vixie, of Farsight Security.) Several of them independently reviewed the records that Max’s group had discovered and confirmed that they would be difficult to fake. A senior aide on Capitol Hill, who works in national security, said that Max’s research is widely respected among experts in computer science and cybersecurity."],["p","As Max and his colleagues searched D.N.S. logs for domains associated with Republican candidates, they were perplexed by what they encountered. “We went looking for fingerprints similar to what was on the D.N.C. computers, but we didn’t find what we were looking for,” Max told me. “We found something totally different—something unique.” In the small town of Lititz, Pennsylvania, a domain linked to the Trump Organization (mail1.trump-email.com) seemed to be behaving in a peculiar way. The server that housed the domain belonged to a company called Listrak, which mostly helped deliver mass-marketing e-mails: blasts of messages advertising spa treatments, Las Vegas weekends, and other enticements. Some Trump Organization domains sent mass e-mail blasts, but the one that Max and his colleagues spotted appeared not to be sending anything. At the same time, though, a very small group of companies seemed to be trying to communicate with it."],["p","Examining records for the Trump domain, Max’s group discovered D.N.S. lookups from a pair of servers owned by Alfa Bank, one of the largest banks in Russia. Alfa Bank’s computers were looking up the address of the Trump server nearly every day. There were dozens of lookups on some days and far fewer on others, but the total number was notable: between May and September, Alfa Bank looked up the Trump Organization’s domain more than two thousand times. “We were watching this happen in real time—it was like watching an airplane fly by,” Max said. “And we thought, Why the hell is a Russian bank communicating with a server that belongs to the Trump Organization, and at such a rate?”"],["p","Only one other entity seemed to be reaching out to the Trump Organization’s domain with any frequency: Spectrum Health, of Grand Rapids, Michigan. Spectrum Health is closely linked to the DeVos family; Richard DeVos, Jr., is the chairman of the board, and one of its hospitals is named after his mother. His wife, ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/betsy-devos"},"Betsy DeVos"],", was appointed Secretary of Education by ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump"},"Donald Trump"],". Her brother, Erik Prince, is a Trump associate who has attracted the scrutiny of ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/robert-mueller"},"Robert Mueller"],", the special counsel investigating Trump’s ties to Russia. Mueller has been looking into Prince’s meeting, following the election, with a Russian official in the Seychelles, at which he reportedly discussed setting up a back channel between Trump and the Russian President, Vladimir Putin. (Prince maintains that the meeting was “incidental.”) In the summer of 2016, Max and the others weren’t aware of any of this. “We didn’t know who DeVos was,” Max said."],["p","The D.N.S. records",["inline-embed",{"type":"analytics","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22analytics%22%2C%22url%22%3A%222%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":""}]," raised vexing questions. Why was the Trump Organization’s domain, set up to send mass-marketing e-mails, conducting such meagre activity?

After analyzing the data, Max said, “We decided this was a covert communication channel.”"],["p","The Trump Organization, Alfa Bank, and Spectrum Health have repeatedly denied any contact. But the question of whether Max’s conclusion was correct remains enormously consequential. Was this evidence of an illicit connection between Russia and the Trump campaign?

August, 2016, Max decided to reveal the data that he and his colleagues had assembled. “If the covert communications were real, this potential threat to our country needed to be known before the election,” he said. After some discussion, he and his lawyer decided to hand over the findings to Eric Lichtblau, of the ",["em","Times"],". Lichtblau met with Max, and began to look at the data."],["p","Lichtblau had done breakthrough reporting on National Security Agency surveillance, and he knew that Max’s findings would require sophisticated analysis. D.N.S. lookups are metadata—records that indicate computer interactions but don’t necessarily demonstrate human communication. Lichtblau shared the data with three leading computer scientists, and, like Max, they were struck by the unusual traffic on the server. As Lichtblau talked to experts, he became increasingly convinced that the data suggested a substantive connection. “Not only is there clearly something there but there’s clearly something that someone has gone to great lengths to conceal,” he told me. Jean Camp, of Indiana University, had also vetted some of the data. “These people who should not be communicating are clearly communicating,” she said. In order to encourage discussion among analysts, Camp posted a portion of the raw data on her Web site."],["p","As Lichtblau wrote a draft of an article for the ",["em","Times"],", Max’s lawyer contacted the F.B.I. to alert agents that a story about Trump would be running in a national publication, and to pass along the data. A few days later, an F.B.I. official called Lichtblau and asked him to come to the Bureau’s headquarters, in Washington, D.C."],["p","At the meeting, in late September, 2016, a roomful of officials told Lichtblau that they were looking into potential Russian interference in the election. According to a source who was briefed on the investigation, the Bureau had intelligence from informants suggesting a possible connection between the Trump Organization and Russian banks, but no data. The information from Max’s group could be a significant advance. “The F.B.I. was looking for people in the United States who were helping Russia to influence the election,” the source said. “It was very important to the Bureau. It was urgent.”"],["p","The F.B.I. officials asked Lichtblau to delay publishing his story, saying that releasing the news could jeopardize their investigation. As the story sat, Dean Baquet, the ",["em","Times"],"’ executive editor, decided that it would not suffice to report the existence of computer contacts without knowing their purpose. Lichtblau disagreed, arguing that his story contained important news: that the F.B.I. had opened a counterintelligence investigation into Russian contacts with Trump’s aides. “It was a really tense debate,” Baquet told me. “If I were the reporter, I would have wanted to run it, too. It felt like there was something there.” But, with the election looming, Baquet thought that he could not publish the story without being more confident in its conclusions."],["p","Over time, the F.B.I.’s interest in the possibility of an Alfa Bank connection seemed to wane. An agency official told Lichtblau that there could be an innocuous explanation for the computer traffic. Then, on October 30th, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid wrote a letter to James Comey, the director of the F.B.I., charging that the Bureau was withholding information about “close ties and coordination” between the Trump campaign and Russia. “We had a window,” Lichtblau said. His ",["a",{"href":"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/01/us/politics/fbi-russia-election-donald-trump.html"},"story"]," about Alfa Bank ran the next day. But it bore only a modest resemblance to what he had filed. The headline— “",["em",{"class":"small"},"Investigating Donald Trump, F.B.I. Sees No Clear Link to Russia"],"”—seemed to exonerate the Trump campaign. And, though the article mentioned the server, it omitted any reference to the computer scientists who had told Lichtblau that the Trump Organization and Alfa Bank might have been communicating. “We were saying that the investigation was basically over—and it was just beginning,” Lichtblau told me."],["p","That same day, Slate ran a ",["a",{"href":"http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/cover_story/2016/10/was_a_server_registered_to_the_trump_organization_communicating_with_russia.html"},"story"],", by Franklin Foer, that made a detailed case for the possibility of a covert link between Alfa Bank and Trump. Foer’s report was based largely on information from a colleague of Max’s who called himself Tea Leaves. Foer quoted several outside experts; most said that there appeared to be no other plausible explanation for the data."],["p","One remarkable aspect of Foer’s story involved the way that the Trump domain had stopped working. On September 21st, he wrote, the ",["em","Times"]," had delivered potential evidence of communications to B.G.R., a Washington lobbying firm that worked for Alfa Bank. Two days later, the Trump domain vanished from the Internet. (Technically, its “A record,” which translates the domain name to an I.P. address, was deleted.

For instance, Foer’s sources had found that the Trump domain was blocking incoming e-mail, and argued that this was evidence that Trump and Alfa Bank were maintaining a private communications network; in fact, Listrak routinely configured its marketing servers to send e-mail but not to receive it. Graham also noted that the domain was administered not by Trump but by Cendyn, a company in Boca Raton that handled his company’s marketing e-mail."],["p","Alfa Bank hired two cybersecurity firms, Mandiant and Stroz Friedberg, to review the data.

Bank was founded by Mikhail Fridman, in the last years of the Soviet Union. Fridman was born in western Ukraine and studied metallurgy in college. Like many others of his generation, he was introduced to the market economy through hustle. He sold theatre tickets, washed windows, and ran a student discothèque. After the Soviet Union collapsed, in 1991, Fridman joined the scramble to befriend members of the new government and amass a fortune with help from the state. Along with an economist named Petr Aven, who had previously served as the country’s minister for foreign economic relations, Fridman built Alfa Bank into one of the most successful businesses in the new Russia. Its parent company, Alfa Group, now controls the country’s largest private bank, along with financial institutions in several European nations."],["p","Fridman and Aven acquired reputations as brilliant, relentless businessmen. Describing the lawless post-Soviet years to the journalist Chrystia Freeland, who is now the foreign minister of Canada, Fridman said, “We were absolute savages.” In a notorious episode in 2008, a group of Russian companies, including Alfa Group, tried to gain control of a joint venture they’d formed with British Petroleum. The power struggle was so fierce that the C.E.O. of the joint venture, Robert Dudley, felt compelled to leave Russia. The oligarchs kept pushing for control of the BP venture until it was sold to a state-owned petroleum company, for fifty-five billion dollars; Alfa Group’s cut was almost fourteen billion."],["p","Alfa Bank prospered during the Yeltsin years and has continued to do so under Putin. Though Fridman and Aven are not part of Putin’s innermost circle, they have managed to avoid the fate of some other oligarchs, who have had assets seized and, in a few cases, been imprisoned, after falling out of favor.

Members of Russia’s government and many of its businessmen have been under American economic sanctions since 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea, but Alfa’s principals and representatives have enjoyed access to U.S. politicians at the highest levels. Fridman and Aven met several times with officials at the Obama White House, discussing such issues as Russia’s effort to gain entrance to the World Trade Organization. (Alfa Bank maintains that it has “never advocated for political or trade issues on behalf of the Russian government.”) “Fridman and Aven were seen as people that Washington could talk to about U.S.-Russia, because they checked two boxes—they were ‘polite company’ oligarchs, and they could shed light on Putin’s intentions and perspective,” a senior official in the Obama Administration told me. “They got meetings at State and on the Hill and at the White House. And they were understood to be operating with the consent and guidance of Vladimir Putin.”"],["p","Alfa is still closely tied to the Russian system, but Fridman and Aven live much of the time in the United Kingdom. If there was a communications link with the Trump Organization, it might have been created without their knowledge.

If a company’s services are required in some way, the officer—called a ",["em","kurator"],"—coördinates them. “A company couldn’t say no,” a Washington-based Russia expert told me. (When asked about this, an Alfa Bank spokesperson said, “To our knowledge there are no senior intelligence officials at senior levels at Alfa Bank.”)"],["p","This past May, I saw Petr Aven in New York, at the Four Seasons Hotel. He had just come from a dinner in Washington, at which he had met a group of prominent Americans, including officials from the White House, to discuss Russia’s economic situation. Aven seemed worried about surveillance; before we sat down, he brought his phone to the other side of the lobby and hid it behind a plant. He wouldn’t say much for the record, but he told me that his bank didn’t have “any connection at all with Trump—nothing.”"],["p","Aven and Fridman have visited Washington less often since Trump took office. But Trump’s victory appeared to elevate Alfa Bank’s connections there—at least by association. Don McGahn, the White House counsel, came from Jones Day, one of the law firms that represent Alfa Bank in the United States. McGahn brought five Jones Day lawyers with him into the White House; six more were appointed to senior posts in the Administration. Jones Day has done work for businesses belonging to a long list of Russian oligarchs, including Oleg Deripaska, Viktor Vekselberg, and Alexander Mashkevich. The firm has also represented the Trump campaign in its dealings with Robert Mueller. For this reason, McGahn secured an ethics waiver that allows him to talk to his old firm when its clients have business before the U.S. government."],["p","In June, 2017, Trump nominated Brian Benczkowski, a lawyer who had overseen the Stroz Friedberg report for Alfa Bank, to lead the criminal division of the Justice Department. At his confirmation hearing, Benczkowski said emphatically that Stroz Friedberg, like Mandiant, had rejected the possibility of complicity. The investigation, he said, found that “there was no communications link between the Trump Organization and Alfa Bank.”"],["p","Democratic senators expressed concern that Benczkowski had taken on work for Alfa Bank; he had been a senior member of Trump’s transition team and had good reason to expect that he would be appointed to a job in the Administration. “The client was a Russian bank that is under suspicion of having a direct connection with the Trump campaign,” Senator Richard Durbin said, during the hearing."],["p","He and the other Democratic senators were especially troubled that Benczkowski would not commit to recusing himself from dealing with Mueller’s investigation, even though he had worked for two of Russia’s leading oligarchs. “Why did you refuse to recuse yourself?” Senator Dianne Feinstein asked."],["p","“I don’t know what’s in Special Prosecutor Mueller’s investigation,” Benczkowski said. “I’m a lawyer in private practice. I have no idea what he’s up to, other than what I read in the papers.”"],["p","Despite these questions, the Republican-led committee approved Benczkowski. This past July, the Senate confirmed

Republicans in Congress have rejected the possibility of collusion, with some joining Trump in calling the Mueller inquiry a politically motivated “witch hunt,” a few Democrats have continued to pursue the matter. After Trump’s Inauguration, two Democratic senators who had reviewed the data assembled by Max’s group—Mark Warner and a colleague who requested anonymity—asked the F.B.I. for an assessment of any potential contacts between Alfa Bank and the Trump Organization. The material was also brought to the attention of the C.I.A., which found it substantial enough to suggest that the F.B.I. investigate. In March, 2017, a Pennsylvania news outlet called Lancaster Online reported that F.B.I. agents had visited the offices of Listrak, the company that housed the Trump server. Ross Kramer, Listrak’s C.E.O., told me, “I gave them everything they asked for.”"],["p","Around the same time,",["inline-embed",{"type":"analytics","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22analytics%22%2C%22url%22%3A%225%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":""}]," the second Democratic senator approached a former Senate staffer named Daniel Jones and asked him to give the data a closer look.

Bush Administration. Now he was running an investigations firm, the Penn Quarter Group, and a nonprofit initiative called the Democracy Integrity Project, which was intended to help keep elections free from foreign interference."],["p","To assess the Alfa Bank data, Jones assembled a team of computer scientists, divided into two groups, one on each coast. (They also consulted with Jean Camp, who agreed to coöperate despite the possibility that Alfa Bank might take legal action.) All these experts have national reputations in the field. Some have held senior cybersecurity jobs in the Pentagon, the White House, and the intelligence services, as well as in leading American technology companies. In order to encourage an unbiased outcome, Jones never introduced the East Coast group to the West Coast group."],["p","I met several times with the two members of the East Coast group and spoke with them repeatedly. They used pseudonyms, Paul and Leto, in part because they had been alarmed by encounters with Russia while they were working at high levels of government. Leto said that, in 2016, as he was investigating cyber intrusions that seemed to originate in Russia, he became convinced that he was being followed. Both he and Paul believed that their phones had been hacked. These incursions coincided with a period of intense Russian activity in the U.S., including the hacking of the D.N.C., a pro-Trump ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/10/01/how-russia-helped-to-swing-the-election-for-trump"},"social-media blitz"],", and the arrival of Maria Butina, who is accused of being a Russian agent sent to ingratiate herself with American conservative leaders. (Butina has denied the accusations.)"],["p","As Paul and Leto began working, they needed to verify that Max’s data presented an accurate picture of the traffic. After the Slate story appeared, skeptics pointed out that no one has a comprehensive view of the Domain Name System. They speculated that other entities, besides Alfa Bank and Spectrum Health, had looked up the Trump domain, and that Max had failed to see them. The D.N.S. company Dyn told a reporter that it had seen lookups from other computers around the world. But Dyn turned out to have registered only two additional lookups, both from the same address in the Netherlands."],["p","Max and his colleagues maintain that they are able to see nearly all the D.N.S. lookups on a given domain; the senior Capitol Hill aide I spoke to affirmed that Max’s group is widely understood to have this capability. Paul Vixie, one of the original architects of the D.N.S. network, examined the data and told me, “If this is a forgery, it’s better than any forgery I’ve seen.” Jones’s team also ran analyses and real-time tests to check Max’s access to D.N.S. records. “It’s completely implausible that he could have fooled us,” Paul said."],["p","Max had provided the Jones team with thirty-seven million D.N.S. records, enough to fill thousands of screens with time stamps and I.P. addresses—long strings of numbers and letters in green type. Over the course of several months, Paul and Leto examined the data for patterns and anomalies. “We stared at a lot of green screens,” Paul said. They regarded their inquiry as a statistical enterprise, capturing each Alfa Bank D.N.S. query from the ocean of data that they had been given and plotting it over a four-month period. Both said that they began their work as skeptics. “I started from an assumption that this is a bunch of nonsense,” Leto told me."],["p","Much of the information that was publicly available might well have supported that assumption. Foer’s article in Slate had prompted online discussions, in which commentators offered explanations ranging from the benign to the sinister. The timing of the lookups, which came in the summer just before the election, invited speculation. Foer claimed that the biggest flurries of traffic coincided with major campaign events, including the party conventions. Paul and Leto were dubious. If anything, the traffic coincided with Paul Manafort’s time as Trump’s campaign manager—but the D.N.S. queries continued after Manafort stepped down. “A lot of people are seeing faces in clouds,” Leto said."],["p","The Trump Organization had done little to clarify the matter. In October, 2016, it released a statement denying interactions with Alfa Bank “or any Russian entity.” Instead, it offered a peculiar explanation for the D.N.S. traffic: it had been triggered when “an existing banking customer of Cendyn”—the marketing firm—had used the company’s systems to send communications to Alfa Bank. Such a scenario would be highly irregular; it was as if Gmail had allowed a user to send e-mail from another user’s account. “It makes no sense,” Paul told me."],["p","Trump’s advocates claimed that the investigations sponsored by Alfa Bank had proved that Alfa and the Trump Organization were not communicating. In fact, they sidestepped the question. Mandiant, one of the cybersecurity firms, said that it was unable to inspect the bank’s D.N.S. logs from 2016, because Alfa retained such records for only twenty-four hours. The other firm, Stroz Friedberg, gave the same explanation for why it, too, was “unable to verify” the data."],["p","As Jones’s team vetted the data, they examined various possible explanations.

Most malware has “distinctive patterns of behavior,” Camp told me. It is typically sent out in a blast, aimed simultaneously at multiple domains. There is a “payload”—a mechanism that activates the malicious activity—and a “recruitment mechanism,” which enables the malware to take over parts of a vulnerable computer. None of the experts whom Jones assembled found any evidence of this behavior on the Trump server. “Malware doesn’t keep banging on the door like that,” Paul said."],["p","A second possibility was marketing e-mail. After the Slate article appeared, some commentators suggested that Trump’s server had innocently sent promotional e-mails to Alfa Bank, and that a computer there had responded with queries designed to verify the identity of the sender. This became a catchall answer for anyone who couldn’t explain what had happened. “Either this is something innocuous, like spam,” Rachel Cohen, a press secretary for Senator Warner, told me, “or it’s completely nefarious.”"],["p","Alfa Bank had received Trump marketing e-mails in the past. But Cendyn had told CNN that it stopped sending e-mails for the Trump Organization in March, 2016, before the peculiar activity began; Trump had transferred his online marketing to another company, called Serenata. Jones’s team investigated, and found additional evidence that the server wasn’t sending marketing e-mails at the time. One indicator was the unusually limited traffic. Kramer, of Listrak, told me that a typical client sends “tens of thousands of e-mails a day” to huge numbers of recipients. If the Trump server was following that pattern, it would have generated significant D.N.S. traffic. To establish a kind of control group, Jones’s team asked Max to capture the D.N.S. logs for the Denihan Hospitality Group—a hotel chain, similar in size to Trump’s, which was using Cendyn and Listrak to send marketing e-mails. In a sample spanning August and September, 2016, a Denihan domain received more than twenty thousand D.N.S. queries, from more than a thousand I.P. addresses. In the same period, the Trump domain had twenty-five hundred lookups, nearly all of them from Alfa Bank and Spectrum Health."],["p","The timing and the frequency of the D.N.S. lookups also did not suggest spam, Paul and Leto believed. Mass-marketing e-mails are typically sent by an automated process, one after another, in an unbroken rhythm. The Alfa queries seemed to fall into two categories. Some came in a steady pulse, while others arrived irregularly—sometimes many in a day, sometimes a few. “The timing of the communication was not random, and it wasn’t regular-periodic,” Paul said. “It was a better match for human activity.”"],["p","But, if the Trump server wasn’t sending or receiving e-mail, what could explain the traffic? There was the possibility of “spoofing”—essentially, faking an identity. Did someone try to make it appear, falsely, that Alfa Bank was reaching out to the Trump Organization? Jones’s team concluded that such an attack would have been unlikely to produce thousands of D.N.S. lookups, over such a long time. “Maybe for a few days, but not four months,” Leto said. There was also a question of motive. In the spring of 2016, very few people knew that Max and his colleagues were able to monitor D.N.S. traffic so comprehensively, so any spoofers would have been impersonating Alfa Bank with little expectation of being detected. News stories investigating the links between Trump and Russia were months away. “Why would someone do that?” Steven Bellovin, of Columbia, said. “And why would they pick those

(Max rejected the idea that his group had fabricated data. “If we were going to lie, then we would have made up a much better story than this!” he said.)"],["inline-embed",{"type":"callout","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22callout%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22inset-left%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22cartoon%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522cartoon%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%2522%252Fcartoon%252F5bb7f6aaca53412dbdd9352f%2522%252C%2522width%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522height%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522caption%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%225bb7f6aaca53412dbdd9352f%5C%22%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%22%2C%22attrs%22%3A%7B%7D%7D","ref":""},["inline-embed",{"type":"cartoon","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22cartoon%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22%2Fcartoon%2F5bb7f6aaca53412dbdd9352f%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":"5bb7f6aaca53412dbdd9352f"}]],["p","Because Alfa Bank did not retain its D.N.S. logs (many large companies don’t), its assessments of what produced the lookups in early 2016 are necessarily speculative. “We are as mystified as anybody about these false allegations,” Birnbaum told me this September. In a series of exchanges over three weeks, he offered a range of possibilities. He suggested that the data had been faked, but also that they had been stolen from the bank’s logs. He attributed the traffic to ",["em","kompromat"],", but also expounded a scenario in which it had been caused by a technical glitch: Trump e-mails “hidden” in the system were intermittently processed by the bank’s security software, an application called Trend Micro Deep Discovery Inspector. In this explanation, Trump marketing e-mails from before March, 2016, had made it through the spam filter and been stored in a permanent archive, where the bank backs up all its e-mail. Periodically, the bank re-scanned that archive, as updates to the security software provided new information about",["inline-embed",{"type":"analytics","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22analytics%22%2C%22url%22%3A%227%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":""}]," which senders might be unsafe.

In the course of several months, the bank said, this could account for the traffic."],["p","The experts I spoke to confirmed that this was a technically plausible, if highly inefficient, way to configure security software. But the explanation raised questions of its own. Alfa Bank said that its scans ran for two days after each update. But Max’s data don’t show a consistent pattern of two-day spikes. Another concern lay in the chronology. The bank had received e-mails from the Trump domain in late 2015 and early 2016, which should have triggered lookups. But, according to the data, the lookups didn’t begin until May, 2016. In response to a question about this discrepancy, Birnbaum said that the Trend Micro software had not been “fully integrated” until March—but that wouldn’t account for the time between March and May."],["p","A third problem was that, if Alfa Bank wasn’t receiving new e-mails from the Trump Organization after March, 2016, then the number of Trump e-mails in the archive—and thus the number of lookups—should have remained steady through the summer. But Max’s data showed a different pattern: no lookups in the spring, a small number in May, and then a slow increase starting in June, with spikes that lasted until the system went offline. When asked about the increase, Birnbaum offered another refinement of the explanation. The bank had previously said that the software had performed checks of old e-mails “multiple times over the six-month period.” Now he said that a security update “around August” had caused old e-mails to be re-scanned."],["p","In any case, for an explanation of this kind to work, it would require the servers at Spectrum Health to be simultaneously experiencing the same glitch, or another one with similar effects. (Spectrum declined to answer questions about its computer systems.) Trend Micro has thousands of users, most of them businesses, but in the sample that Max and his colleagues could see, only Alfa Bank and Spectrum Health exhibited this peculiar behavior."],["p","For some, the most baffling part of the puzzle was the way that the lookups stopped. The Trump domain vanished from the Web on the morning of Friday, September 23rd, two days after the ",["em","Times"]," presented its data to B.G.R., Alfa Bank’s lobbyists in Washington, but before it called Trump or Cendyn. In Max’s view, this was evidence of direct contact between Alfa Bank and Trump. One researcher whom Foer interviewed put it vividly: “The knee was hit in Moscow, the leg kicked in New York.” There is, however, at least one possibility that doesn’t involve Moscow: the lobbyists in Washington could have passed along a warning to Trump, as a courtesy. But B.G.R. denies doing this, calling the idea “ridiculous on its face.”"],["p","Whatever the reason that the Trump domain vanished, Alfa Bank’s servers continued trying to look it up: Max’s group observed fifteen failed attempts that Friday, twenty-eight on Saturday, none on Sunday, ninety on Monday, twenty on Tuesday. Spectrum Health’s machine kept trying, too, in a weeklong spasm of activity that entailed thousands of seemingly automated lookups. Spectrum never succeeded in relocating the Trump server—but Alfa did. On the night of Tuesday, September 27th, ten minutes after the bank made its last failed attempt, it looked up the domain name trump1.contact-client.com—which was, it turned out, another route to the same Trump server."],["p","The alternative domain name does not appear to have been previously active; no one has produced an e-mail sent from it. So how did Alfa find it? The easiest method would have been by consulting a ",["em",{"class":"small"},"PTR"]," record, which shows what domain names are associated with a given I.P. address. But the ",["em",{"class":"small"},"PTR"]," record for the Trump address did not include the alternative name."],["p","Birnbaum said that Alfa Bank’s researchers, investigating the traffic, found the new name in other public records and then performed a test lookup. Vixie said that such a lookup would be unusual, and questioned why the bank would feel that it was necessary: “Why did Alfa look up either name? And especially the second name?”"],["p","According to Max’s data, Alfa Bank looked up the new domain name only once. In the following months, he and his group stopped collecting data on the Trump Organization domains. After the Slate story came out, curious readers looked up the address thousands of times, and the D.N.S. traffic devolved into statistical noise. The Trump Organization now controls the original domain; in March, 2017, Cendyn told CNN that it had been “transferred back.” Records show that Cendyn handed over the domain only a few days before the CNN story ran—a year after the last e-mail was sent from it. Jones’s team believed that Cendyn had continued its relationship with the Trump Organization in 2016. “There were thousands of e-mails between Trump and Cendyn through the entire period that Alfa Bank was looking up the Trump server,” Max told me. Cendyn said that this was “regular business correspondence,” related to transferring back the domain. When I called the company’s C.E.O., Richard Deyo, to ask more broadly about the situation, he said, “This is old news—that’s just Internet traffic,” and then hung up.

Jones’s team sifted through explanations for the traffic, they began constructing their own theory. “What you have here is a minimally viable technical footprint of a small number of people who are using what I suspect is an ad-hoc system to communicate,” Paul said. “Anytime the F.B.I. or anyone else pulls apart a cyber-crime organization, there is always some communication structure that’s used for command and control. That’s where the high-value communications happen.” (Max and his colleagues did not see any D.N.S. evidence that the Trump Organization was attempting to access the server; they speculated that the organization was using a virtual private network, or V.P.N., a common security measure that obscures users’ digital footprints.)"],["p","If this was a communications mechanism, it appeared to have been relatively simple, suggesting that it had been set up spontaneously and refined over time. Because the Trump Organization did not have administrative control of the server, Paul and Leto theorized that any such system would have incorporated software that one of the parties was already using. “The likely scenario is not that the people using the server were incredibly sophisticated networking geniuses doing something obscure and special,” Max said. “The likely scenario is that they adapted a server and vender already available to them, which they felt was away from prying eyes.” Leto told me that he envisioned “something like a bulletin-board system.” Or it could have been an instant-messaging system that was part of software already in use on the server."],["p","Kramer, of Listrak, insisted that his company’s servers were used exclusively for mass marketing. “We only do one thing here,” he told me. But Listrak’s services can be integrated with numerous Cendyn software packages, some of which allow instant messaging. One possibility is Metron, used to manage events at hotels. In fact, the Trump Organization’s October, 2016, statement, blaming the unusual traffic on a “banking customer” of Cendyn, suggested that the communications had gone through Metron, which supports both messaging and e-mail."],["p","The parties might also have been using Webmail—e-mail that leaves few digital traces, other than D.N.S. lookups. Or, Paul and Leto said, they could have been communicating through software used to compose marketing e-mails. They might have used a method called foldering, in which messages are written but not sent; instead, they are saved in a drafts folder, where an accomplice who also has access to the account can read them. “This is a very common way for people to communicate with each other who don’t want to be detected,” Leto told me. David Petraeus, when he was the director of the C.I.A., used this method to exchange intimacies—and to share classified information—with his lover, Paula Broadwell. In June, an attorney for the Mueller investigation accused Paul Manafort of using foldering to facilitate secret communications."],["p","Given the limitations of D.N.S. data, none of the independent experts I spoke to could be certain of what Alfa Bank and the Trump Organization were doing. Some of them cautioned that it was impossible even to guess at every way that an e-mail system might malfunction. A senior analyst at a D.N.S.-service provider said, “Things can get messed up in unexpected ways.” But Paul and Leto maintained that they had considered and rejected every scenario that they had encountered in decades of cybersecurity work. “Is it possible there is an innocuous explanation for all this?” Paul said. “Yes, of course.

and Leto periodically went back to Max in the course of their research, interrogating his assumptions and asking for more information. In one tranche of data that he gave them, they noticed that a third entity, in addition to Alfa Bank and Spectrum Health, had been looking up the Trump domain: Heartland Payment Systems, a payments processor based in Princeton. Of the thirty-five hundred D.N.S. queries seen for the Trump domain, Heartland made only seventy-six—but no other visible entity made more than two. Heartland had a link to Alfa Bank, but a tenuous one. It had recently been acquired by Global Payments, which, in 2009, had paid seventy-five million dollars for United Card Services, Russia’s leading credit-card-processing company; two years later, United Card Services bought Alfa Bank’s credit-card-processing unit. (A spokesperson for Global Payments said that her company had never had any relationship with the Trump Organization or with Alfa Bank, and that its U.S. and Russia operations functioned entirely independently.)"],["p","Spectrum Health has a similarly indirect business tie to Alfa Bank. Richard DeVos’ father co-founded Amway, and his brother, Doug, has served as the company’s president since 2002. In 2014, Amway joined with Alfa Bank to create an “Alfa-Amway” loyalty-card program in Russia. But such connections are circumstantial at best; the DeVos family seems far more clearly linked to Trump than to Russia."],["p","If Trump and Alfa Bank—as well as Spectrum Health and Heartland Payment Systems—were communicating, what might they have been talking about? Max and some of the other scientists I spoke to theorized that they may have been using the system to signal one another about events or tasks that had to be performed: money to be transferred, for instance, or data to be copied. “My guess is that, whenever someone wanted to talk, they would do a D.N.S. lookup and then route the traffic somewhere else,” Richard Clayton, of the University",["inline-embed",{"type":"analytics","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22analytics%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22final%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":""}]," of Cambridge, said. Camp also speculated that the system may have been used to coördinate the movement of data. She noted that Cambridge Analytica, which was working for the Trump campaign, took millions of personal records from Facebook. In Camp’s scenario, these could have been transferred to the Russian government, to help guide its targeting of American voters before the election."],["p","The researchers I spoke with were careful to point out that the limits of D.N.S. data prevent them from going beyond speculation. If employees of the companies were talking, the traffic reveals nothing about who they were or what they were saying; it is difficult to rule out something as banal as a protracted game of video poker. “If I’m a cop, I’m not going to take this to the D.A. and say we’re ready to prosecute,” Leto said. “I’m going to say we have enough to ask for a search warrant.” More complete information could be difficult to obtain. This March, after Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee announced that it had found no evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, the committee’s Democrats filed a dissent, arguing that there were many matters still to be investigated, including the Trump Organization’s connections to Alfa Bank. The Democrats implored the majority to force Cendyn to turn over computer data that would help determine what had happened. Those records could show who in the Trump Organization used the server. There would probably also be a record of who shut down the Trump domain after the ",["em","Times"]," contacted Alfa Bank. Cendyn might have records of any outgoing communications sent by the Trump Organization. But the request for further investigation is unlikely to proceed as long as Republicans hold the majority. “We’ve all looked at the data, and it doesn’t look right,” a congressional staffer told me. “But how do you get to the truth?”"],["p","The enigma, for now, remains an enigma. The only people likely to finally resolve the question of Alfa Bank and the Trump Organization are federal investigators. Max told me that no one in his group had been contacted. But, he said, it wasn’t necessary for anyone in the F.B.I. to talk to him, if the agents gathered the right information from other sources, like Listrak and Cendyn. “I hope Mueller has all of it,” he said. ♦"]]],"canonicalUrl":"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/10/15/was-there-a-connection-between-a-russian-bank-and-the-trump-campaign","categories":{"sections-toc":[{"id":"590412649f91e567e06eca93","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"590412649f91e567e06eca93","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Reporting","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"reporting"},{"id":"5902abaf27562e4d156e37e1","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections -

This true-crime account of Sally Horner, one of the inspirations for Vladimir Nabokov’s “Lolita,” aims to resurrect a victim whose anguish was transformed into sleek prose. Horner was kidnapped by a serial child abuser named Frank La Salle, in 1948, in New Jersey, and during nearly two years in captivity she drove with him across the country. Nabokov alluded to the pair by name in his novel, but Weinman argues that Nabokov minimized Horner’s influence on the book. Weinman’s intensive research uncovers a bright girl—she maintained excellent grades before, during, and after her ordeal—who survived the kidnapping only to be killed two years later in a car crash. Through careful storytelling, Weinman retrieves Horner from her role as grist in the mill of literary history."],["inline-embed",{"type":"callout","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22callout%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22feature-small%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22callout%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522callout%2522%252C%2522name%2522%253A%2522inset-left%2522%252C%2522body%2522%253A%2522%253Cinline-embed%2520type%253D%255C%2522image%255C%2522%2520meta%253D%255C%2522%25257B%252522type%252522%25253A%252522image%252522%25252C%252522url%252522%25253A%252522%25252Fphotos%25252F5bb541f872b4842cd218247b%252522%25252C%252522width%252522%25253A%252522%252522%25252C%252522height%252522%25253A%252522%252522%25252C%252522caption%252522%25253A%252522%252522%25257D%255C%2522%2520ref%253D%255C%25225bb541f872b4842cd218247b%255C%2522%253E%253C%252Finline-embed%253E%2522%252C%2522attrs%2522%253A%257B%257D%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%22%5C%22%3E%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22image%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522image%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%2522%252Fphotos%252F5bb541f872b4842cd218247b%2522%252C%2522width%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522height%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522caption%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%225bb541f872b4842cd218247b%5C%22%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%22%2C%22attrs%22%3A%7B%7D%7D","ref":""},["inline-embed",{"type":"callout","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22callout%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22inset-left%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22image%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522image%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%2522%252Fphotos%252F5bb541f872b4842cd218247b%2522%252C%2522width%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522height%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522caption%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%225bb541f872b4842cd218247b%5C%22%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%22%2C%22attrs%22%3A%7B%7D%7D","ref":""},["inline-embed",{"type":"image","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22image%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22%2Fphotos%2F5bb541f872b4842cd218247b%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":"5bb541f872b4842cd218247b"}]]],["p",["strong",["a",{"href":"https://www.amazon.com/American-Prison-Reporters-Undercover-Punishment/dp/0735223580/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1539010781&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=American+Prison"},"American Prison"]],["em",", by Shane Bauer (Penguin Press)"],".

of White Plains, New York, where they attended middle school. The men, both forty, have the easy rapport of friends who’ve been cracking each other up since they were six. The show, now in its second season, is based on their painfully awkward early-teen years as best friends in Westchester County. Its protagonists, Nick and Andrew, are forced to navigate the rough seas of puberty while besieged by biological urges represented by convivial, and chatty, creatures called “hormone monsters.” Now the real Nick and Andrew were back at the scene of the crime.

Not to brag, but I was a child and then a forty-year-old man.”"],["p","“Andrew could grow a full beard by the time he was in eighth grade,” Kroll said, with a hint of lingering envy."],["p","“My parents really did wax my lip,” Goldberg said, referring to an incident in the show’s second season. “I couldn’t grow hair there for years.”"],["p","“We called the lack of hair the reverse Hitler,” Kroll said."],["p","Michael Kay, the head of the school, greeted the pair and showed them into the gym. “It’s now air-conditioned,” he said proudly. Kroll pointed to a wall lined with exercise mats. “I remember I was playing defense in basketball, and I went to block a shot and ran head first into that wall, and I think I got a concussion, and then they put up the padding,” he said."],["p","“The Nick Kroll Memorial Padding,” Goldberg said."],["p","Inside the auditorium, which contained a sculptural mural depicting the seven days of creation, Kroll said, “We put up a production of ‘Oklahoma!’ here in eighth grade.”"],["p","“I was stage crew,” Goldberg said."],["p","“I played Ali Hakim, the swarthy Persian peddler,” Kroll said. “Even in a Jewish school, I was playing the Middle Easterner.”"],["p","Outside, Kroll pointed out a brown brick annex. “My sixth-grade class was there,” he said. “Mrs. Friedman’s class.

She didn’t single out anyone.”"],["p","“",["em","Some"]," of you,” Goldberg said, raising his eyebrows meaningfully."],["p","After bidding farewell to Kay, Kroll and Goldberg decided to swing by Rosedale Deli, where they used to buy snacks on their way to Goldberg’s house. “I’m an only child, and both my parents worked, so we had the run of the place,” Goldberg said."],["p","“We’d watch ‘",["a",{"href":"https://www.amazon.com/Waynes-World-Mike-Myers/dp/B00005JH9J"},"Wayne’s World"],"’ every day, or MTV’s ‘The Grind,’ with Eric Nies,” Kroll added."],["p","At the deli, they knew what they wanted. “I hope they have peach Snapple,” Kroll said. “And we need to get some Doritos.”"],["p","“Cool Ranch Doritos,” Goldberg emphasized."],["p","“One day, we saw Charles Oakley from the New York Knicks here,” Kroll said. “He stood chugging a one-litre bottle of Hawaiian Punch, and then he looked at us and said, ‘They don’t make these things big enough.’ ” Goldberg laughed."],["p","Loaded with their provisions, they made their way to the home of Goldberg’s parents, Michael and Linda. The couple were waiting outside, looking not unlike Marty and Barbara from “Big Mouth.”"],["p","“They don’t get a lot of action on this cul-de-sac,” Goldberg said, giving Linda a kiss. “Hi, Mom.”"],["p","Linda, who is in her seventies, with a dark bob and eyeglasses, has become a rabbi since retiring from her job as a consultant at I.B.M. “I have a couple I’m marrying who are going to dress up as a hormone monster and monstress,” she told Goldberg and Kroll."],["p","“For Halloween or for the wedding?” Kroll asked, deadpan."],["p","Inside, the four sat at the kitchen table. “This is where we used to hang out,” Kroll said, settling in. He recalled a trip to China with the Goldbergs. “In Hong Kong, the only thing Andrew and I wanted to do was go to Temple Street to buy fake Rolexes and silk boxer shorts.”"],["p","“You liked those silk boxers so much,” Linda told Goldberg. “You would wear boxers that would match the color of the bar mitzvah you were going to—teal or hot pink.”"],["p","“Oh, yes, the color of the yarmulke,” Goldberg said, abashed. He turned to Kroll. “So I guess it would be wrong to say that you care more about fashion than I do,” he said.

Electoral meddling, enormous data breaches, that feeling of hollowness that users are invariably left with after logging off—we regret it all. And we’re going to do better. Facebook started out with one simple, noble mission: to psychologically atomize the global population for our own economic benefit, all while doubling down on the Orwellian claim that we’re “bringing people together.” That was the plan. We had no idea that it was going to lead to this tangibly worse world we now inhabit. Seriously! Think about the empty materialism of the eighties, or the depressed listlessness of the nineties—we figured the rise of social media would, at worst, just create a new existential malaise that we could make billions of dollars from. Anyway, it looks like that ship has sailed.

He wouldn’t pick up his phone or respond to e-mails, so we went to his new address, in Atlanta. It was an empty field with a lone gravestone. Apparently, James has been dead for two hundred years.

the Web site for Hunan Slurp, you’ll find a movingly earnest mission statement: the chef and owner, Chao Wang, “seeks to cure his homesickness through cooking.” Is there a better reason to open a restaurant, a more convincing interpretation of the ever-elusive concept of authenticity? Wang, who was born in Hengyang, a city in South China’s Hunan Province famed for its food culture, was an artist before he ventured into the hospitality business, and it’s compelling to think of his restaurant as an installation of sorts, a merging of mediums. The dining room is unusually beautiful and abstractly transportive, framed by a ridged wooden canopy and punctuated with sleek round mirrors that reflect golden light from hanging hand-blown bulbs. The tables, blond wood or marble and mostly long and communal, are set with ceramic plates, wooden chopsticks, and spoons with narrow, heavy handles that are satisfying to hold."],["inline-embed",{"type":"callout","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22callout%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22feature-small%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22image%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522image%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%2522%252Fphotos%252F5bb68191b3243c2da4b66b60%2522%252C%2522width%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522height%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522caption%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%225bb68191b3243c2da4b66b60%5C%22%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%22%2C%22attrs%22%3A%7B%7D%7D","ref":""},["inline-embed",{"type":"image","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22image%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22%2Fphotos%2F5bb68191b3243c2da4b66b60%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":"5bb68191b3243c2da4b66b60"}]],["p","The latter are, naturally, for slurping: the specialty here, ",["em","mifen"],", or rice noodles, is served in soups. Though “slurp” is a word that may conjure overeager sloppiness in English—whether or not you find its onomatopoeic effect appealing is something of a Rorschach test—its counterparts in Chinese suggest gracious satisfaction. A diner’s slurping is a compliment to the chef. And there’s nothing remotely sloppy about these soups, which are as carefully composed as oil paintings and bear surprisingly subtle seasoning. A clay pot of cloudy white broth—full of silky fillets of sea bass, curling gently, and dressed with delicate fronds of micro herbs, tendrils of scallion, sweet goji berries, and flower petals—seems bland at first but builds slowly in concentrated fish flavor as it’s spooned up. A bowl of Hometown Lu Fen makes a handsome advertisement for itself, its simple broth and noodles obscured by a tantalizing ombré fan of sliced beef tendon, fatty pork, and tofu, plus peanuts and julienned cucumber."],["inline-embed",{"type":"callout","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22callout%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22feature-small%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22image%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522image%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%2522%252Fphotos%252F5bb68191fae4412cdecfd9a4%2522%252C%2522width%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522height%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522caption%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%225bb68191fae4412cdecfd9a4%5C%22%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%22%2C%22attrs%22%3A%7B%7D%7D","ref":""},["inline-embed",{"type":"image","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22image%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22%2Fphotos%2F5bb68191fae4412cdecfd9a4%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":"5bb68191fae4412cdecfd9a4"}]],["p","It’s a pleasure to inhabit Wang’s homesickness, his memories, his palate. Even the sort of comfort food whose comfort tends to be heavily reliant on childhood familiarity is made elegant and broadly appealing. Braised chicken feet are bright with chili oil and coated with sesame seeds, dried chili, and chopped garlic, the cartilage sliding easily off the bone in sweet, sour mouthfuls. On a recent evening, a paste of durian, the Asian fruit whose scent is so divisive that it’s banned on public transport in Singapore, was packaged sleekly in moon cakes, an off-menu addition in honor of the impending mid-autumn harvest festival at which they are customary. I can’t say I enjoyed them, exactly—garlic past its prime came to mind—but I ate several bites.

2012, Michael Wang, a senior at James Logan High School, in the Bay Area, was confident that he had done enough to get into one of his dream schools: Harvard, Yale, Stanford, and Princeton. He had the kind of G.P.A.—4.67—that looks like a typo to anyone older than thirty-five. He had aced the ACT and placed in the ninety-ninth percentile on the SAT. But Wang didn’t want to be seen merely as a bookworm—he was an accomplished member of the speech-and-debate team, and he had co-founded his school’s math club. He played the piano and performed in a choir that sang with the San Francisco Opera, and at Barack Obama’s first Inauguration."],["p","The following spring, Wang was rejected from all the Ivy League universities he had applied to, except the University of Pennsylvania. (He made the wait lists at Harvard and Columbia, but was eventually turned down at those schools, too.) He was devastated, and wondered what more he could have done. Then he started thinking about all the impediments that no amount of hard work could overcome. Some of his classmates who had got into these schools, he thought, had less impressive credentials than his. But they were Hispanic and African-American. Had he been rejected because he was Asian?"],["p","Wang had always been told that Asian students in America were held to higher standards than everyone else. When he was young, his parents suggested that, if he wanted to go to a school like Harvard, he would have to outwork other Asian students. Swearing off television became a competitive advantage. In high school, his friends, who were predominantly Asian, believed that their race would work against them in the admissions process. Wang knew students whose families were mixed Asian and white who identified themselves as white on their applications, lest they be lumped in with all the other overachievers. The Princeton Review has, in the past, encouraged students of Asian descent to try to conceal their cultural identity. There are admissions-counselling companies, like Asian Advantage, in the Bay Area, that help students strategize their extracurricular activities (less piano and tennis), and others, like Ivy Coach, based in New York City, that promise to make students “appear less Asian” in their application materials."],["p","Wang found this notion troubling. “How are you not supposed to be proud of who we are?” he asked me, in August, when I met him for lunch in San Francisco, where he works as a paralegal. His office is in the financial district, on the border of Chinatown. As we walked a few blocks to get noodles, passing from one San Francisco into another, he recounted his story."],["p","In 2013, Wang began talking to family friends familiar with the law about his options. That June, he filed a discrimination complaint against Yale, Stanford, and Princeton with the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights. (He did not include Harvard and Columbia, since he was still on the wait lists there.) At first, he said, he hoped to “reap the benefits” himself—never mind that these schools were unlikely to reconsider an applicant who was trying to sue his way into the freshman class. But Wang came to see the issue as one of fairness, and he thought that perhaps he could help someone in the future. He studied the history of Asian-Americans and college admissions, and eventually came across the work of a conservative activist named Edward Blum, a financial adviser who has devoted his life to overturning race-conscious laws. Blum has shown a talent for pinpointing vulnerabilities in civil-rights law and attacking them in the courts. Wang and Blum spoke on the phone and they agreed to keep in touch. At the time, Blum was heading a nonprofit called the Project on Fair Representation, and was working with Abigail Fisher, a white student who, in 2008, had been rejected by the University of Texas at Austin. The school guaranteed admission to Texas students in the top ten per cent of their high-school class; from those under the threshold, like Fisher, admissions officers chose applicants through a process that considered, among other criteria, race and family background. Fisher sued the university, alleging that this policy was unconstitutional. Blum helped assemble, and cover the bills for, Fisher’s legal team.

curiosity about the process has helped launch a chain of events that might ultimately alter the course of civil-rights history. In 2013, as Wang was preparing to go to college—he attended Williams—he was interviewed by officials at the Department of Education. Colleges generally say little about their decision-making processes, describing them as a “secret sauce” that makes each school distinct. (Being vague also protects them from legal liability.) But one of the investigators looking into Wang’s claim confirmed that many Ivy League admissions officers had, in the past, talked stereotypically when evaluating Asian-American applicants. “Oh, typical Asian student. Wants to become a doctor. Nothing special here,” Wang said, paraphrasing what the investigator had relayed to him. (The Office for Civil Rights did not make a judgment in Wang’s case.)"],["p","Few people knew about Wang’s complaint until July, 2014, when he wrote an op-ed for the San Jose ",["em","Mercury News"]," describing the “anger” that Asian-Americans felt about being held to unfair standards. Wang’s article and his case were picked up by Chinese-immigrant newspapers and social media. Though Wang professes to be in favor of affirmative action, the most egregious aspects of his story captivated a small but vocal network of Chinese-Americans, who had heretofore shown little interest in American politics. Spurred by WeChat, a Chinese social-media platform, and encouraged by what they saw as the next great civil-rights struggle, they threw their support behind Wang and other Asian-American students penalized by the college-admissions process."],["p","These activists found an ally in Blum. That November, Blum filed a ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-uncomfortable-truth-about-affirmative-action-and-asian-americans"},"federal lawsuit"]," against Harvard University. The suit advances a surprising line of argument. Instead of claiming that the process is unfair to whites—an increasingly tough sell, at least in the media—the suit suggests that affirmative action, a mechanism intended to help minorities such as Asian-Americans, is actually being used to harm them. Blum hopes for a college-admissions process in which there would be no race or ethnicity boxes to check, and students would be evaluated more or less anonymously. To bring the suit, Blum created Students for Fair Admissions, a membership organization roughly modelled on the A.C.L.U. and the N.A.A.C.P., which sued the university on behalf of its members, some of whom were students with stories similar to Wang’s."],["p","S.F.F.A. alleges that Harvard attempts to curate the racial breakdown of each incoming class. In order to achieve classes that, in recent years, have been roughly half white, twenty per cent Asian-American, fifteen per cent black, and twelve per cent Hispanic, Harvard routinely gives Asian-American applicants—who often excel when it comes to standardized testing, grades, and extracurricular activities—lower marks in the more subjective “personal” category, which includes everything from the student’s admissions essay to letters of recommendation and alumni interviews. If S.F.F.A. can prove that Harvard engages in “balancing,” which is illegal, the school could be forced to remove any considerations of race and ethnicity from its admissions process. Harvard maintains that its process is a “whole person review,” in which applicants aren’t reduced to a single factor, whether it’s academic excellence or their racial and ethnic identity. “We do not discriminate against applicants from any group,” Rachael Dane, a Harvard spokesperson, told me. “I don’t use the term ‘balance,’ because we don’t balance.”"],["p","After the Harvard filing, Blum gave talks at Asian-American community functions, and at any event that would have him. He found people who were eager to join his movement. On October 15th, the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, in Boston, will begin hearing S.F.F.A.’s suit. The day before, organizers are planning to hold a rally outside the courthouse, to be attended by predominantly Chinese-American anti-affirmative-action activists from throughout the country. (S.F.F.A. has also filed a suit against the University of North Carolina–Chapel Hill, alleging that its race-conscious admissions policy is unlawful, though no trial date has been set.)"],["p","This alliance, between a white conservative tactician and a comparatively inexperienced base of recently energized Asian-American activists, has complicated the traditional optics of the civil-rights and diversity debates. Winifred Kao, a lawyer at the Asian Law Caucus, said that Blum was not “a champion for Asian-Americans, by any means.” Rather, he was “using Asian-Americans as a wedge, as we’ve often been used, throughout our racial and civil-rights history.” Many of Blum’s critics point to a video in which he admits that he “needed” Asian plaintiffs to pursue this latest challenge to affirmative action. “I feel that the Asian-American student population and community is being used as a pawn in a chess game, around limited resources in élite sectors of American society,” Prudence Carter, a sociologist and the dean of the Graduate School of Education at the University of California, Berkeley, told me. “I think that the entire world can see that.”"],["p","If Blum’s suit is successful, the effect will be felt far beyond Harvard.

action has never been adequately defined. Historians often trace the concept to Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal provisions insuring equal-employment opportunities, regardless of “race, color, or creed.” The term first appeared in a policy context in the National Labor Relations Act of 1935, which allowed workers to unionize without fear of retribution. Employers who were found to have discriminated against an employee were required to rehire him, or to make amends, through “affirmative action.” Harold Ickes, the Secretary of the Interior under Roosevelt, went one step further, establishing a quota system to insure that Public Works Administration projects employed a fixed percentage of African-Americans. (Many local officials refused to comply.) Throughout the forties and fifties, there was a broad, top-down drive to build fair-employment practices and to integrate institutions like the armed forces and public schools. But the first time the government used the term in relation to race was in March, 1961, when John F. Kennedy signed Executive Order 10925, which required government contractors to “take affirmative action” to help realize the nation’s goal of “nondiscrimination.” (Hobart Taylor, Jr., a young lawyer who helped draft the order, chose the phrase for its alliterative quality. We could all be debating “positive action” instead.)"],["inline-embed",{"type":"callout","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22callout%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22inset-left%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22cartoon%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522cartoon%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%2522%252Fcartoon%252F5bb7ca5bca53412dbdd9349d%2522%252C%2522width%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522height%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522caption%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%225bb7ca5bca53412dbdd9349d%5C%22%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%22%2C%22attrs%22%3A%7B%7D%7D","ref":""},["inline-embed",{"type":"cartoon","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22cartoon%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22%2Fcartoon%2F5bb7ca5bca53412dbdd9349d%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":"5bb7ca5bca53412dbdd9349d"}]],["p","The premise of affirmative action was that, for African-Americans, the status quo was innately negative. To act affirmatively was to acknowledge the history of denigration and inequity that continued to define black life, and to come up with ways in which the future could be different. But Kennedy’s efforts didn’t prescribe any specific remedies. When, a few years later, in a new executive order, Lyndon Johnson reiterated the commitment to affirmative action, he didn’t have anything specific in mind, either, though one draft memorandum, dated January, 1964, listed twenty-five possible interpretations, from eliminating segregated smoking areas and cafeterias to publicizing equal-employment policies. (In 1967, Johnson amended his order to ban discrimination on the basis of sex. In the affirmative-action debate, the gains for women in education and in the workplace aren’t often considered.)"],["p","In the face of government slowness, affirmative action came to be defined by the judicial system. In 1978, the Supreme Court considered a case brought by Allen Bakke, a white man who believed that, if he had been a minority, he would have been admitted to the medical school at the University of California, Davis. Bakke’s claim of “reverse discrimination” galvanized the long-simmering resentment that some whites felt in the wake of the civil-rights era. Justice Lewis Powell was the case’s pivotal figure; he joined four Justices in striking down Davis’s admissions policy, which included a quota for underrepresented minorities. But he joined the other four Justices in upholding affirmative action as permissible under the law, singling out for praise Harvard’s admissions system, which regarded race or ethnicity as a “plus” rather than as a determining factor. Unlike his colleagues, who largely supported affirmative action as a corrective to historical injustice, Powell based his decision on the principle of “diversity.” This was not the original impulse of the civil-rights movement—the presence of African-Americans at the lunch counter wasn’t about enriching the environment of Woolworth’s. Powell’s compromise changed the terms of affirmative action. Admissions policies could no longer acknowledge the past; they could only advance a more diverse future. Diversity eventually became a ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/10/09/the-limits-of-diversity"},"self-rationalizing principle"],", and produced an entire industry of counselling and compliance."],["p","Throughout the seventies, higher education and business were expansive in their duty to act affirmatively—an effort supported by both Republicans and Democrats. But there were also seeds of backlash, which drew on the accusations of reverse discrimination that had animated Bakke’s grievance."],["p","In the early nineties, Glynn Custred, an anthropologist at California State University, Hayward, who had told the Washington ",["em","Post"]," that affirmative action was like “reversed Jim Crow,” met Tom Wood, a Ph.D. recipient who believed that affirmative action was the reason he could not find a professorship. Together, they drafted Proposition 209. Known as the California Civil Rights Initiative, Prop. 209 would ban affirmative action in educational settings. For the first time, American voters were given the chance to weigh in on large-scale affirmative-action policies. Prop. 209 passed in November, 1996."],["p","The effect on the enrollment of people of color was immediate. Between 1995 and 1998, offers of admission to African-Americans at Berkeley and U.C.L.A. declined by fifty-five per cent. Pedro Noguera, a professor of education at U.C.L.A., was a faculty member at Berkeley at the time. “You end up with the University of California at Berkeley or U.C.L.A. looking more like Ole Miss, where most of the black students are athletes, not there for academic reasons,” he told me."],["p","In the following twenty years, a wave of ballot initiatives inspired by Prop. 209 were successful, in Washington, Michigan, Nebraska, Arizona, and Oklahoma. (In addition, affirmative action was outlawed in Florida, through an executive order, and in New Hampshire, through legislation.) In some states, like Texas, California, and Florida, colleges and lawmakers explored other ways to maintain racial diversity, such as considering socioeconomic factors in admissions decisions, or creating programs to guarantee admission to public colleges for the top graduates from each high school. But the most powerful defense of affirmative action came, once again, from the courts. In 2003, the Supreme Court ruled, in Grutter v. Bollinger, involving the University of Michigan Law School, and in Gratz v. Bollinger, regarding the University of Michigan’s undergraduate-admissions policy, that educational institutions had a compelling interest in promoting diversity. Elise Boddie, a professor at Rutgers Law School, observed that the conservative challengers to affirmative action “keep losing.” “When you have Bakke, the Grutter case, and now Fisher—those are three cases where the Court, over the period of [forty] years, has affirmed the importance of diversity as a constitutional value,” she said."],["p","Cases like these, which involve college admissions, tend to draw headlines. But, in 2007, the Supreme Court made an important ruling in Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District No. 1. At stake was whether a school district could use race as a “tiebreaker” when assigning students to different campuses, as a way to achieve diversity and avoid what amounted to segregated schools. The Court deemed such attempts at “racial balancing” in educational institutions to be unlawful."],["p","The effect of this back-and-forth has been that we tend to consider affirmative action only in a narrow spectrum of activities. Nearly sixty years after Kennedy’s broad mandate, which arose out of a desire to transform society, our understanding of it—and our wrangling about it in the courts and in the media—has come down to the relatively small issue of school admissions. Even victories for affirmative action establish precedents that draw the circle of acceptable practices ever smaller."],["p","Suspicions about the fitness and the qualifications of nonwhites didn’t begin with affirmative action. But it has become the most prominent way that these suspicions are aired, since the stakes are so clear. Life rarely seems so zero-sum as it does when we imagine that we are vying for the lone seat in the classroom."],["p","“Affirmative action is part of a larger struggle,” Randall Kennedy, a professor at Harvard Law School, told me. “The much larger struggle is the struggle against the idea that the United States is a white man’s country.

Yes,

origins of affirmative action assumed a racial binary of whites and blacks. “Asian-Americans often don’t have the opportunity to be complex in mainstream portrayals,” Vincent Pan, the co-head of Chinese for Affirmative Action, a San Francisco-based advocacy organization, told me. Stories of academic overachievement came to define how many outsiders understood Asian-Americans. In 1971, ",["em","Newsweek"]," praised Asian-Americans for “out-whiting the whites.” This trope of the “model minority” has proved to be a persistent stereotype, a tribute to a community that seems to work hard and complain very little. Michael Wang felt that it was only recently that Asian-Americans, long fearful of rocking the boat, had grown tired of accepting “second best.”"],["p","This past summer, I met Joe Wei, the managing editor of the ",["em",["a",{"href":"https://www.worldjournal.com/"},"World Journal"]],", a Chinese-language newspaper with bureaus in New York, San Francisco, and Los Angeles, at a café in Manhattan’s Chinatown. Wei, who has a broad face and a gentle but assertive voice, has been a reporter and an editor at the ",["em","World Journal"]," for twenty-six years. The paper is a vital resource for new immigrants, providing information about voting, garbage pickup, and civic rights. “We’re helping them become citizens,” Wei, who was born and raised in Taiwan, told me. “We help them as a live encyclopedia.”"],["p","“Let’s start here,” Wei said, unfolding a napkin and drawing a horizontal line with a pen. He began recounting the history of Chinese people in America, beginning with westward expansion and the gold rush, in the mid-nineteenth century, when an influx of largely poor Chinese immigrants provided cheap, often indentured, labor. They were the ones who founded the Chinatowns. Wei marked a spot on the time line: the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, born of xenophobia, which effectively ended Chinese immigration for sixty years. And then, coinciding with the Cold War, another mark on the line: the sixties, as the United States began recruiting talented students, particularly in the sciences and math, from places like Taiwan and Hong Kong. Wei was describing people like my parents, who came from Taiwan in the early seventies, for graduate school. It was no surprise that communities like the one I grew up in were seen as the model minority—our ranks had been selected to come to America and pursue largely untroubled middle-class lives. As the ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2003/02/10/the-long-march-2"},"Civil Rights Act of 1964"]," was remapping the rights of America’s minority populations, the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, which favored skilled labor, and attracted young science and engineering students from Asia, was reshaping who those minorities were."],["p","Moments of crisis reminded the diverse, far-flung Asian-American community of the need to unify across lines of class, geography, and national origin. Wei added a mark at 1982, the year that Vincent Chin, a young Chinese-American man, was beaten to death in the suburbs of Detroit by two white men. They pleaded guilty to manslaughter, and were given three years’ probation and a modest fine. The lenient verdict prompted outrage and nationwide organizing, and became a turning point in Asian-American politics."],["p","At the nineties, Wei drew a heavy vertical line. After the massacre in Tiananmen Square, in 1989, the United States began welcoming immigrants from mainland China in large numbers. The Chinese Student Protection Act of 1992 provided green cards to nearly fifty-five thousand Chinese nationals, and this influx accelerated in the two-thousands, particularly after the financial crisis spurred a desire for foreign investment. As of 2016, there were an estimated 21.4 million Asians in the U.S., approximately 4.9 million of whom were of Chinese descent. Wei said that the more recent immigrants included engineers and tech workers, among others, with enough resources to move straight to the suburbs. They have arrived at a time when China is ascendant. “They don’t know about Chinese Exclusion,” Wei said. “They don’t know who is Vincent Chin.”"],["p","Many of these immigrants can be found on WeChat, which is something like a messaging app combined with Twitter, and was introduced in China in 2011. It quickly became the primary way that Chinese people engage with the digital world. “You turn [off] your WeChat in Beijing airport. Then you turn on in J.F.K., and everything comes on,” Wei said. “You never go out of China, because everything is in WeChat.” In the past few years, researchers have grown concerned about misinformation on WeChat, which has more than a billion users.

October, 2013, “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” aired a brief segment that became one of the least likely geopolitical turning points ever. While asking children for their views on some of America’s biggest problems, Kimmel pointed out that China owned much of our debt. What should be done? A six-year-old said that we should kill all the Chinese. Rather than scolding him, Kimmel deferred to a late-night host’s most trustworthy tool: a bemused, knowing grin. The bit went viral in the Chinese media, where an abbreviated, translated version had Kimmel advocating genocide against Chinese people. The ",["em","World Journal"]," picked up the story. Kimmel apologized. The White House eventually had to weigh in, saying that the comments did not “reflect mainstream views of China in the United States.” Vincent Xie, who was inspired by the incident to start a WeChat account called Civil Rights, told me that it didn’t matter if Kimmel was joking. “Would he have made such a joke about African-Americans or Jews?” he asked me, in Mandarin."],["p","Among Chinese immigrants, particularly first-generation ones, the Kimmel segment became part of a story about how liberals in this country took Asian-Americans for granted—“the sense,” Chi Zhang said, “that Chinese-Americans are sacrificed in the left agenda to achieve so-called equality for other minority groups.”"],["p","The following year, SCA-5, a bill that sought to overturn Proposition 209 and restore the consideration of race in school admissions, passed in the California State Senate. Polling data suggested that California voters were open to the bill. A survey from 2012 showed that Asian-Americans supported affirmative action by a three-to-one margin. But many Asian-Americans who had rarely participated in grassroots politics began mounting a campaign against SCA-5, which some called “Skin Color Act 5.” A post on a Web site for South Asian professionals called it “the most racist bill in the history of California.” The most fervent activism came from Chinese-Americans, who used WeChat as an organizing tool. For many lawmakers, unaware of WeChat, or the gateway effects of the Kimmel affair, this loud and aggressive opposition to SCA-5 came as a surprise. Much of the Chinese-American organizing was happening beyond the reach of mainstream media. Activists coördinated mailings to flood politicians’ offices, and staged demonstrations dramatizing their plight as an overlooked minority. In March, 2014, SCA-5 was withdrawn."],["p","Yukong Zhao, who lives in Florida, was one of the activists. Zhao arrived in the United States in 1992, and focussed on graduate school in urban affairs and business, finding a job, his visa and citizenship, and family life. He rose through the ranks at Siemens. During the financial crisis, Zhao noticed that many Chinese families had not lost their homes. He began exploring the cultural differences between Asians and everyone else, and self-published a book on the subject in 2013. After the Kimmel incident, Zhao became more engaged. He read about SCA-5, and published an op-ed denouncing it in the ",["em","World Journal"],". The next year, he started an organization called the Asian American Coalition for Education. Later, the issue came closer to home. He told me that his son had been a victim of discrimination: despite superlative grades and test scores, he was not accepted to a “top” college. “He has a classmate, who is Hispanic—she got admitted by Johns Hopkins but he did not,” Zhao said."],["p","Zhao met Edward Blum through a Chinese reporter. “I noticed that when a black kid is wrongfully accused by the police, many African-American organizations stood up behind that kid,” Zhao said. “But, when Asian-American children are discriminated, no organizations stood up.” The work of conservative activists like Blum helped give context for what Zhao and others were already doing. “Asian-Americans are the most discriminated by this kind of race-based college admissions,” Zhao said. “We need to let the American society know our suffering.”"],["p","Zhao was adamant that they weren’t “tools” of Blum. On the contrary, he continued, “the complaints against Harvard really originated in the movement against SCA-5.” In 2016, Zhao got more than sixty Asian-American advocacy groups to file complaints with the Department of Justice and the Department of Education, alleging discrimination by Harvard. (The Department of Education dismissed the complaint, but the Department of Justice opened an investigation in 2017. In September, it began investigating Yale’s admissions policies as well.)"],["p","Though Joe Wei was broadly supportive of people like Zhao, he was apprehensive about what might result from their efforts. He wasn’t sure that newer immigrants understood the “history of struggle,” or the importance of diverse schools that weren’t “one hundred per cent Asian.” “I feel like, ‘Hey, stop it.

He wasn’t going to find it, he said, among his “buddies at A.E.I., Hudson, and Cato,” the conservative think tanks. At the time, the membership of Students for Fair Admissions had plateaued at “a few thousand,” he told me.

But they confirmed what researchers like Karthick Ramakrishnan, at U.C. Riverside, and Janelle Wong, at the University of Maryland, have found: although Asian-Americans consistently support affirmative action, since around 2012 support among Chinese-Americans has noticeably fallen. Wong believes that the change in Chinese-American attitudes had to do “with the spread of information and misinformation” on WeChat.

She was surprised to find that thirty of them, on both sides of the issue, couldn’t accurately explain what affirmative action was. “Quite frankly, the public generally has no goddam clue of how admissions work,” Poon said. When asked for their ideal system for a place like Harvard, thirty-three of them essentially described “race-conscious holistic review, which is exactly what we have today.” Poon has worked as an admissions-application reader in the University of California system, and she was impressed by Harvard’s comprehensive approach, which required each application to be read and vetted by multiple people, and then voted on by a forty-person panel."],["p","“My anxiety about this case is really with folks who think they’re allies, and who say they support affirmative action,” Poon said. The opponents of affirmative action had so thoroughly dominated the terms of the debate that supporters were often unconsciously perpetuating a distorted vision of what actually happens—repeating claims that Harvard undervalued Asian students’ “personalities,” for example, an argument that ignores the complexities of the “personal” category. “They’re actually parroting some of the points that Ed Blum is making, and it’s killing me,” Poon said."],["p","Vincent Pan, the co-head of Chinese for Affirmative Action, told me that when he describes affirmative action in terms of employment opportunities, or hiring more Asian-American judges or college faculty, people overwhelmingly support it. He rued how narrow the discussion had become, confined to a few places at the nation’s élite institutions. He pointed out that there are more Asian-Americans in San Francisco’s community colleges than in all the Ivy League schools combined."],["p","While the Harvard admissions process sucks up the headlines, Asian-Americans have benefitted as much as anyone else from increased opportunities in education, employment, and government service. And the current terms of debate don’t capture the full complexity of the Asian-American community.

first time I spoke with Blum, he stopped me after I introduced myself and asked that I repeat my name. He wanted to get it right. “I’ve had a lot of practice over the past three or four years,” he said. Blum looks and sounds a bit like a gentler, more affable version of the sports pundit Skip Bayless, with a long face, deep-set, probing eyes, and a slight frown. In 1992, while living in Houston, Blum ran for Congress as a Republican. As he canvassed, he realized that the district had been drawn in a way that consolidated the black vote. Blum lost the election. He believed that this “racial gerrymandering” violated the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and he, along with fellow-plaintiffs from across Texas, sued the state. The case, Bush v. Vera, eventually went to the Supreme Court, which in 1996 struck down Texas’s redistricting plan. Since then, Blum has become known for pairing potential plaintiffs with novel legal strategies. He describes himself as a matchmaker."],["p","Blum is conscious of being cast as a villain. He told me that he had hoped that keeping the plaintiffs anonymous would “unshackle” the conversation, and allow people to discuss the issues of affirmative action or anti-Asian discrimination on their merits. But he has nevertheless become a focal point. His pretrial court filings have provided revealing glimpses into Harvard’s secretive process. A Web site devoted to publicizing the school’s side of the story singles him out by name. Rachael Dane, the Harvard spokesperson, reiterated the school’s position, that this was “a politically motivated lawsuit brought by Ed Blum and the organization he created.” What’s at stake, she told me, isn’t just the school’s admissions policy; it’s the ability of Harvard to pursue its stated mission, to “provide a diverse living environment” to “the citizens and citizen-leaders for our society.”"],["p","Blum is confident that his legal team has constructed a compelling argument. He giggled as he described its opening brief, which cites the quotas of the twenties and thirties which kept Jewish students out of Harvard, as being “like a Michener novel,” with “bones in the ground.” “America agrees with us,” Blum told me, referring to a 2016 Gallup poll, conducted in the wake of the Abigail Fisher decision, showing that about two-thirds of Americans disagreed with the Court’s ruling. “Sadly, it’s the courts that have been dragging their feet.” He drew an analogy to gay marriage. “Our nation said, ‘You know, I know a gay couple. I know a lesbian couple. And I like ’em. I’ve gone out to eat dinner with them, they’ve been over to my house. Everybody likes ’em. If they want to get married, fuck, let ’em get married.’ That was a galvanizing moment. How did that happen? The Court didn’t lead America there. America led the Court there. That’s what this movement is about.”"],["p","Blum saw the Harvard case as attempting to return to “the original vision of the civil-rights movement,” he said. “The longer this goes on, the more polarizing it becomes for our nation’s fabric. Stopping it restores what the nineteen-fifties and sixties civil-rights movement was all about.” Yukong Zhao had also echoed the traditional language of civil rights, saying that affirmative action was “against Dr. Martin Luther King’s famous words, right? He said, ‘I want my children to be judged by the content of their character, not by their skin color.’ ”"],["p","Randall Kennedy, the law professor, said that, in fact, he was “surprised that it took so long” for a legal challenge to involve Asian-Americans. In early reverse-discrimination cases, like Bakke, Kennedy said, “many people thought, Gosh, how rich. White supremacy in the United States . . . and now all of a sudden white people are the victims of racial oppression? But now, even better to have a ‘people of color’ victim.

late August, Blum returned to the Bay Area to update the Silicon Valley Chinese Association on the case’s progress. His work is funded largely by DonorsTrust, an organization that distributes money from various conservative and libertarian contributors, but he wanted to make smaller, grassroots groups like S.V.C.A. feel empowered as well."],["p","A couple of nights before the event, I visited Alex Chen, the founder of the S.V.C.A., at his house in the serene, recently developed hills of east San Jose. It was almost dinnertime, and I heard various Asian languages as I walked up and down the block, trying to find his house. Chen, who is forty, greeted me warmly. He has a round face, with attentive, constantly blinking eyes, and sprouts of chin hair. He led me to a table in his kitchen, where there were bottles of whiskey and baijiu, and a plate of freshly roasted peanuts. Outside, his two children took a break from their homework to jump on a trampoline."],["p","Chen speaks Mandarin with a lusty Beijing accent, which gives his English a choppy, dramatic rhythm. He came to the United States in 2006, on an H1B visa, to work as a computer-chip designer. (He received a green card in 2013.) Chen’s initial impressions were that the air-conditioning in America was magnificent but the roads were poor. He poured most of his free time into skiing, shopping, and, eventually, a sport-fishing club."],["p","He was drawn into Chinese-American issues after seeing the Kimmel clip. As he read about SCA-5 on the Internet, he grew concerned about the effect that repealing Prop. 209 might have on his children, who were just starting school. He felt an obligation to do something; having overseen his fishing club, he thought that he already had some leadership skills. On February 15, 2014, after his family had gone to sleep, he went on MITBBS, a Chinese-language message board for Chinese-Americans, and announced that he was starting the S.V.C.A. We clinked glasses of baijiu and he smiled. “That date is very special to me,” he said."],["p","The S.V.C.A. initially comprised about ten people—mostly Chen’s fishing buddies and members of his college alumni network—but they began recruiting people outside Chinese grocery stores and community functions. The S.V.C.A.’s tactics were old-fashioned: it encouraged people to send local politicians snail mail, rather than e-mail. The S.V.C.A.’s mailing list grew quickly, even after the defeat of SCA-5. Chen volunteered for local candidates who supported his group’s agenda, pointing to the election of the state assemblywoman Catharine Baker, who also opposed SCA-5. Today, there are about eighty thousand people in the group’s database."],["p","Another S.V.C.A. leader, Timothy He, joined us. His eyes seemed to glow when he spoke of his political campaigning and organizing. Prior to 2013, He and Chen had known virtually nothing about American history or social issues. “We were just engineers,” He said. “We had no understanding about politics.” He had learned about S.V.C.A. through WeChat, and he was proud that they had not only taught themselves how the political process worked but influenced it, too. He, who is fifty-one, quit his job and started his own business, so that his schedule would accommodate his organizing work."],["p","Chen and He had fully embraced the notions of tough love, hard work, and self-determination, and they were glad that Chinese-Americans had become central to the affirmative-action debate, which they interpreted as race-based quotas. He felt that these policies encouraged their beneficiaries to “be lazy.” “I don’t need to work hard,” Chen said, paraphrasing what he believed to be the prevailing attitude among such people. “I don’t need to study hard, I still can get into a top school.”"],["p","He said that it wasn’t the percentage of Asians at Harvard that he focussed on. “I care about the spirit. Everybody will be working hard.”"],["p","“Other races cannot just enjoy their life and go to the top school,” Chen said, envisioning this future. “They have to study hard. Over all, the result is good for America.”"],["p","I asked Chen and He if they had ever witnessed this “laziness” for themselves. They were quiet for a moment. Then Chen mentioned how, in 2014, Jesse Jackson had come to Silicon Valley and, in Chen’s words, said, “Oh, too many Asians.” (In a speech on the tech industry’s lack of diversity, Jackson floated the idea of eliminating H1B visas.) So, Chen and He explained, companies invested in diversity. He didn’t have much firsthand experience with the results of this effort, but he felt that it went “against the capitalist system.” “The N.B.A.,” Chen continued. “How many Asians there? If you want to do diversity, how about doing diversity in the N.B.A.? I think the show would be not good.”"],["p","It’s possible that immigrants are the only ones who speak about meritocracy and fairness without a trace of irony. (After all, an H1B visa literally attests to one’s merit.) Yukong Zhao, the Florida activist, kept mentioning the American Dream as though it were a contractual arrangement: “The American Dream says that each U.S. citizen should have equal opportunity to pursue prosperity and success through hard work, determination, and initiative.”"],["p","By now it was dark outside in San Jose, and absolutely tranquil on this sprawling hillside.

the hill beyond Chen’s house is the Point, a South Bay megachurch with a panoramic view of San Jose’s haze, where Blum spoke to the S.V.C.A. There was still evidence of a recent movie night: a “Mission: Impossible” banner hung across the entrance, and, in the lobby, a six-foot-tall carton of popcorn was bursting with volleyball-size kernels. I followed the red carpet into the auditorium, and a man jumped out of his seat and introduced himself as Jeff Wang, Michael’s father. Michael’s admissions grievance had transformed his father, who has plunged into politics. He is now a school-board member, and he hosts a weekly political radio program. He handed me a copy of the amicus brief that a coalition of Asian-American advocacy groups had recently filed in support of S.F.F.A.’s Harvard lawsuit. Michael was at home studying for the LSAT."],["p","Before the event began, I chatted with Nathaniel Yu, a recent high-school graduate. He and his family had travelled from Danville, a couple of hours north. Yu was wearing a suit and a checked shirt, and his hair was perfectly parted. Perhaps it was the setting, but his wiry coolness reminded me of Tom Cruise. Yu was whisked onstage by one of the event’s m.c.s, a playfully droll woman named Lily Ding. She introduced Yu as a community hero, a young man who had been bullied by his school’s teachers and administrators."],["p","In 2017, a student-body-election video that Yu had made with some friends was deemed “inappropriate” by school staff, who stripped Yu of his title of junior-class president. (It was a James Bond spoof, in which he played the hero, and his friends, who are Muslim-American, played the villains.) Poor judgment is the province of teen-agers, and perhaps, in a different time, this would have been little more than local news. But the episode went viral, with all the requisite cycles of conservative and liberal moralizing, hate mail, and GoFundMe campaigns. The S.V.C.A. had stepped in to help Yu and his family with a First Amendment lawsuit."],["p","Yu praised the young people in attendance for coming, instead of staying at home playing Xbox or PS4: “Big pat on the back for all of you guys here.” He talked about how affirmative action undermined American values of hard work and determination, especially when it came to education. He sighed with theatrical weariness. “It’s really tough being an Asian person,” he said."],["inline-embed",{"type":"callout","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22callout%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22inset-left%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22cartoon%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522cartoon%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%2522%252Fcartoon%252F5bb7ca5b15b2a12cf77d7f15%2522%252C%2522width%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522height%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522caption%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%225bb7ca5b15b2a12cf77d7f15%5C%22%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%22%2C%22attrs%22%3A%7B%7D%7D","ref":""},["inline-embed",{"type":"cartoon","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22cartoon%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22%2Fcartoon%2F5bb7ca5b15b2a12cf77d7f15%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":"5bb7ca5b15b2a12cf77d7f15"}]],["p","As families trickled in, Ding and her co-host, a grave man named Jason Xu, told jokes about Alex Chen’s slowly receding hairline, a kind of chronicle of S.V.C.A.’s hard work over the years. Ding shared her dismay at Harvard, which she had once considered “the lighthouse of social and moral justice.” Finally, it was time to introduce Blum. “We’re all here because of you, Mr. Blum,” she said."],["p","Blum explained that he intended to prove that Harvard’s admissions process sacrificed high-achieving Asian-Americans in the name of racial balancing. When he mentioned Abigail Fisher, heads in the first row started nodding, as if he were a pop star who had just played the first few notes of his hit single. He spoke for about twenty minutes, finishing with a call to action. He wanted everyone to join S.F.F.A. and, if possible, to donate. He got a standing ovation. “Wow. I’m actually ",["em","pissed"],",” Xu said, as he walked back onstage. Ding, referring to Blum’s attack on the “personal” category in Harvard’s admissions process, said that she didn’t believe that Chinese-American students were “any less personable than any other group.” Then they called for audience members to fly to Boston for the rally the day before the trial: “We should make every effort to be there, to show solidarity and support.”"],["p","There were about five hundred people at the Point, and many more would learn of the event through WeChat and the ",["em","World Journal"],". Blum had told a story that featured Chinese-Americans at the center, as potential heroes. Harvard deserved all the accolades, he had emphasized.

previous generations of Asian-American activists, affirmative action was a key component in the struggle for multiracial justice. In the late eighties, the Department of Education investigated a series of claims alleging that Berkeley, Harvard, and other élite institutions had put a limit on the number of Asian-Americans admitted. The claims had been lodged by young, largely progressive Asian-American activists, for whom affirmative action was the solution to the problems they were identifying, not the cause."],["p","In most cases, the students’ suspicions of unfairness were well founded, and Asian-American populations at these schools began to grow. This history captures the almost paradoxical position of many Asian-American supporters of affirmative action. Nicole Gon Ochi, a lawyer at Asian Americans Advancing Justice, has been working with former, current, and prospective Harvard students, trying to insure that their support for the school’s race-conscious admissions policies is included in the debate. She said that Blum and S.F.F.A. had successfully yoked the question of anti-Asian bias to affirmative action, and she thought the issues were mostly unrelated. Research suggests that if race-conscious admissions were abolished the largest gains would be enjoyed by white applicants, calling into question which groups are actually in competition with one another. “Maybe the ultimate goal is for Asian-Americans to be the predominant group in the élite schools, as opposed to whites,” Prudence Carter, the Berkeley dean, said. “I don’t have a problem with that. But I do have a problem with picking on the few numbers of black and brown students in those schools.” Ochi was adamant that her support for Harvard in this lawsuit did not imply blind approval of all of Harvard’s admissions policies, or deny the need to interrogate claims of institutional bias."],["p","Margaret M. Chin, a sociologist at Hunter College, was involved with the pro-affirmative-action movement as an undergrad at Harvard in the eighties. She has wrestled with the difference between progressive students’ efforts to take Harvard to task for a seemingly low acceptance rate for Asian-Americans, when she was there, and the current conservative movement. “It’s a different historical moment,” she concluded. She was baffled by the resentment the plaintiffs felt toward Harvard. “Why would any of you sue Harvard for doing this? For not accepting you? They reject ninety-five per cent of the people. To me, I was, like, ‘Oh, my God. These kids are really entitled.’ ”"],["p","Perhaps, I wondered, one could feel sympathy that the plaintiffs had put so much faith in meritocracy. Chin grew up in public housing on Sixty-fourth Street, the daughter of a restaurant worker and a garment worker. Now she lived across town, a Harvard- and Columbia-educated sociologist, whose son also attended Harvard. I went to Harvard for graduate school, and I pointed out that, in the eyes of a prospective high-school student, or his worried parents, we had already won."],["p","Harvard’s a tough place, Chin said; many Asian-Americans were stuck on its name. She pointed to how élitist Harvard remains, how those who “have the most” are still the white kids who populate the campus’s secretive Final Clubs. “Our kids are not those kids.”"],["p","In an echo across time, the Berkeley activists of the eighties had called themselves the Student Coalition for Fair Admissions. An internal investigation at the school showed that a change to the admissions standards, in 1984, had dramatically affected Asian-American applicants. The beneficiaries were white students. In April, 1989, Berkeley’s chancellor, a law professor named Ira Michael Heyman, apologized to Asian-Americans. The following year, he stepped down. Heyman had been a civil-rights lawyer and an advocate for racial justice, but he had apparently not thought much about the unique position of Asian-Americans, and he seemed to have underestimated their political will."],["p","I attended Berkeley in the mid-nineties, in the wake of this moment. At the time, I didn’t realize that the new chancellor, an engineering professor named Chang-Lin Tien, had got the job in part as a result of his work mediating between Heyman and the activists. It was not uncommon to hear that the University of California had been overrun by Asians. U.C.L.A. was “University of Caucasians Lost Among Asians.” U.C.I. (Irvine) was “University of Chinese Immigrants.” The jokes seemed to suggest that these schools weren’t as good as they once were. It was a reminder of how the goalposts of achievement and excellence could be moved. I often asked people who blamed affirmative action for holding the Asian-American population at around twenty per cent at Harvard what share of the pie would satisfy them. Did they want Harvard to be fifty per cent Asian? It seemed evident that, if this ever happened, the prestige, the aura of selective élitism, wouldn’t accrue to such a student body—Harvard would no longer be Harvard."],["p","I was a sophomore in November, 1996, when Proposition 209 passed. The school newspaper endorsed Prop. 209, leading to protesters stealing nearly all twenty-three thousand copies. Once the result was clear, I went to the base of the Campanile, the campus’s bell tower, where students had gathered. Some of them had climbed it and refused to come down until affirmative action was reinstated. A person ran up the slope toward us to say that Mario Savio, a hero of Berkeley’s free-speech movement in the sixties, had just died. Through a bullhorn, another person recited the famous speech that Savio had delivered on the steps of Sproul Hall: “There’s a time when the operation of the machine becomes so odious, makes you so sick at heart, that you can’t take part! You can’t even passively take part! And you’ve got to put your bodies upon the gears and upon the wheels . . . upon the levers, upon all the apparatus, and you’ve got to make it stop!

As I listened to Michael Wang talk about the scrutiny that he received after his complaint went public, I admired his spirit. He had launched his complaint in a moment of anger. People online had mocked his earnestness. But now he welcomed the chance to engage his critics, because his own ego was less important than communicating with others."],["p","When Wang and I finished lunch, we returned to his office. We stopped to get bubble tea. As we waited, I asked him about the purple button-up shirt he was wearing—wasn’t that the color of Williams? He smiled, and began rhapsodizing about his time at the college: Thanksgiving dinner with his professors; making Asian food with friends; his twenty-first birthday, when a professor took him out to a bar. He started to talk faster, and the rote stiffness with which he’d recounted his complaint suddenly melted away. “The education I got at Williams was incomparable to what I would get at Harvard,” he said. “I still would have gone to Williams, even if I had gotten into those other schools, now that I’ve been at Williams.”"],["p","He didn’t regret his complaint. He still feels that the process is unfair, and that a bit more transparency would help Asian students in the future. But he had loved college in a way that felt special and rare."],["p","What makes this debate so contentious is that it’s about counterfactuals, alternate versions of ourselves. It’s hard not to take things personally, even if the process traffics in a magical impersonality. There are all of the mythologies that intertwine in the process: the farce of a pure meritocracy, of color blindness; a misplaced faith in standard measures of achievement. We suspect that the system is unfair and nonsensical, but we try anyway. We hope that we will be recognized."],["p","The night before Wang’s graduation, he and his friends stayed up late talking about the past few years, cherishing a few more hours together.

The next morning, he and his friends listened as the author ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/chimamanda-ngozi-adichie"},"Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie"]," delivered the commencement address. “Her message was, you know, when you go out into the world, do things that you won’t regret,” Wang said. “You’ve been given the tools to make an impact and change the world for the better. Go out there and do it.” He thought, Wow, that’s what I want to do. ♦"]]],"canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"sections":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"},"slug":"magazine","children":[{"id":"5914a5e3df30d82b789964f2","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5914a5e3df30d82b789964f2","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Annals of Education","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"annals-of-education"},{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"},{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"}],"name":"Annals of Education","parent":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"},"slug":"annals-of-education"}]}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"magazine","contentTags":[],"contentType":"article","contributors":[{"name":"Hua Hsu","type":"author","title":"Hua Hsu began contributing to \u003cem&gt;The New Yorker\u003c/em&gt; in 2014, and became a staff writer in 2017.","email":"","bio":["div",["p","Hua Hsu began contributing to ",["em","The New Yorker"]," in 2014, and became a\nstaff writer in 2017.

hatchet came later. Rocks were rare in the Red Hills of Kansas, where Carry Nation lived, so, when God commanded her to destroy establishments where alcohol was served, she gathered pieces of brick from her yard and wrapped them in brown paper to look like packages. On the morning of June 7, 1900, she walked into a saloon in Kiowa, told the proprietor to take cover, and began throwing her “smashers,” as she called them, at the mirror above his bar and all the bottles on it."],["p","Later that day, Nation did the same thing at two other bars in town, though when her brick failed to break the mirror at one of them she hurled a billiard ball from a nearby pool table to finish the job. She was detained in Kiowa, but not arrested. Her first jail sentence came nearly seven months and many smithereened bars later, in Wichita. “You put me in here a cub,” she cried from behind the bars of her cell. “But I will go out a roaring lion and I will make all hell howl.” And so she did, switching from “smashers” to hatchets after her release, and getting arrested at least thirty more times for wielding them at bars from San Francisco to Coney Island."],["p","Carry Nation’s wrath was a response to matters both private and public: she was furious at her alcoholic husband, and furious at the legal system that let men like him drink freely to the detriment of women, children, and society at large. Although her means were unusual and her desired ends unfashionable, she was representative of a recurring figure in American history: the woman whose activism is fuelled by anger. Such women are much in the news today, and much in the streets, too, although generally without the hatchet. Since the 2016 Presidential election, countless numbers of them have set out to make hell howl—by disrupting government hearings, occupying federal buildings, scaling the Statue of Liberty, boycotting businesses, going on strike, coming forward with stories of harassment and assault, flooding congressional telephone lines, raising a middle finger at the Presidential motorcade, and attending protests by the millions, sometimes carrying with them representations of the President’s castrated testicles and severed head."],["p","In previous political eras, women like these would have been told to hold their tongues or act more ladylike. These days, however, we are being encouraged, at least in some quarters, to embrace our anger.

any emotion, anger is easy to recognize but difficult to define. We know it when we see it, and certainly when we feel it, yet most definitions struggle to wholly capture it. Philosophers sometimes describe anger as a response to the feeling that something one values has been wronged or harmed. Biologists might explain it as a feeling of pain or discomfort or anxiety, accompanied by the release of hormones, like adrenaline, that increase blood pressure. Psychologists often classify it as a secondary emotion—one that follows from a primary reaction, such as fear or shame, and can take many affective forms, from tears to screaming to silence."],["p","This definitional slipperiness inevitably haunts any effort to make anger into a political tool—what, exactly, is being valorized, an ethical objection or a rush of adrenaline? But one thing is clear: responses to anger depend, to a remarkable degree, on whether the person expressing it is a man or a woman. In “Rage Becomes Her: The Power of Women’s Anger” (Atria), the writer and activist Soraya Chemaly notes early on that women “don’t need books, studies, theories, or specialists” to prove how reviled our anger is. We are all familiar with the stereotypes whereby femininity demands the suppression of anger while masculinity rewards its expression, and whereby angry women are hysterical harpies but angry men—white men, at any rate—are heroes. Rather than dwell on how female rage is received, Chemaly presents a thoroughgoing assessment of its causes: an account, organized thematically, of the private and public abuse, bias, and discrimination faced by women."],["p","The result is both relentless and revelatory. American women between the ages of eighteen and forty-four are nearly twice as likely as men to report feeling exhausted every day; women, if they have sex with men, have fewer orgasms than their male partners; they make less money than their male colleagues; of the thirty highest-paying job categories, twenty-six are dominated by men, while women dominate twenty-three of the thirty lowest-paying categories; female patients are treated for pain less often than male patients who present with the same symptoms; one in four women lives with domestic violence; one in five women has been sexually assaulted; and two-thirds of women have experienced street harassment, roughly half of them before they turned seventeen. Chemaly deftly balances these statistics with grim stories to illustrate them, so that the cumulative effect of reading her book is not merely to legitimize women’s anger but to render it astonishing that we are not even angrier."],["p","All the facts that Chemaly musters were true before the most recent Presidential election, but in its wake many women are refusing to stay quiet about their experiences. Chemaly says that she is calling for a change in our cultural thinking on anger, gender, and politics, but in truth she is responding to one that has already begun. It was on display on January 21, 2017, the day of the first Women’s March, and since then has grown steadily more prominent, and strikingly more personal, with the #MeToo movement. Chemaly’s book has autobiographical passages—many of her female relatives get vivid cameos—but she chooses not to emphasize her own story. By contrast, the Rutgers University professor Brittney Cooper builds a manifesto mostly from memoir. “Eloquent Rage: A Black Feminist Discovers Her Superpower” (St. Martin’s Press) considers African-American feminists from Michelle Obama to Beyoncé, but it is chiefly a chronicle of how Cooper learned to stop disguising and dismissing her own anger."],["p","Cooper writes movingly about coming of age as a black woman in the Baptist Church and on the campus of Howard University—two bastions of black power and, in her experience, black patriarchy. She describes carrying around Audre Lorde’s “Sister Outsider” like a “feminist bible,” and it is mostly from Lorde that she derives her account of how rage can be made useful. Lorde owns anger the way that Monet owns water lilies; no one writing about the emotion today can ignore her address at the National Women’s Studies Association conference in 1981. Delivering “The Uses of Anger: Women Responding to Racism”—a title too often abridged at the colon—Lorde described the bigotry within the feminist movement, and then argued that anger was an appropriate response, because when “focused with precision it can become a powerful source of energy serving progress and change.”"],["p","It was essential for Cooper to develop that focus, she says, in order to make use of her anger: “The clarity that comes from rage should also tell us what kind of world we want to see, not just what kind of things we want to get rid of.” Focus, of course, is really the ability to adjust our vision, measuring one thing accurately against another, and Cooper’s attention to the complex dynamics of anger is illuminating even for readers who don’t agree with the positions she ultimately takes. She weighs her desire to join the first Women’s March as an act of feminist solidarity against her anger over the long-standing failure of white feminists to make common cause with women of color. (In the end, she skips the march, but feels ambivalent about the decision.) She considers her frustration that President Obama did not send troops to rescue the Nigerian schoolgirls kidnapped by Boko Haram alongside her wariness about “getting in bed at any level with the logics of patriarchy and militarism.” (Despite those qualms, she wishes Obama had done more for the girls, many of whom have still not been found.)"],["p","That sort of self-critical reflection is often missing from the journalist Rebecca Traister’s “Good and Mad: The Revolutionary Power of Women’s Anger” (Simon &amp; Schuster). Traister, who covered both of Hillary Clinton’s Presidential campaigns, is a kind of feminist first responder who writes often and sometimes instantly about sexism in America. Her columns and profiles for ",["em","New York"]," magazine are astute accounts of the daily attacks on women’s rights, and the argument she makes in her book is partly one of accretion. Women’s rage, she claims, has long fuelled progressive social change, and the women galvanized by Trump’s election are part of a grand tradition of radicalism. Traister sees parallels between the participants in the Women’s March and the members of the National Women’s Political Caucus who protested when the press failed to cover their presence at the 1972 Democratic National Convention; between the gun-control activist Emma González and the labor activist Rose Schneiderman; between the men who demand smiles from women today and those who, in previous centuries, put women in branks (a metal muzzle, also known as a scold’s bridle, used to silence and publicly humiliate those who were forced to wear it); between the women of #MeToo and those who stormed Versailles during the French Revolution; between herself when she published an angry column and Rosa Parks who, as a girl, picked up a brick and threatened to throw it at a white boy who was bullying her."],["p","Traister writes, “I had no idea how old and deep and urgent was women’s impulse to sometimes just let their fury out without a care to how it would be evaluated, even if that expression of rage put them at risk: in young Rosa Parks’s case, at risk of death; in my case, at risk of being mocked on the internet.” Of course, the Internet these days is very much real life, and abuse there can lead to abuse offline, but the problem with Traister’s comparison is that no semicolon can bridge the gap between those two experiences. That is, in fact, a problem with the book over all: juxtaposition is not a sufficient structure for a political argument. Traister focusses on isolated episodes of anger among progressive women of various races, classes, and eras, while failing to adequately reckon with crucial differences among the circumstances that provoked their anger and the ways in which they chose to respond to it."],["p","But those aren’t superficial differences. They are critical distinctions that lead some angry women to be applauded while others are attacked, and that lead many rebellions to fail while only a few revolutions succeed. Traister writes that she does not wish “simply to cheer” anger, and acknowledges that the rage that fuels insurrections “has the power to burn them up.” But her case for ire is undermined by a rampaging elephant in the room: anger knows no political persuasion. For every Maxine Waters, there’s a Michele Bachmann; for every Gloria Steinem, a Phyllis Schlafly. At the same time that Chemaly, Cooper, and Traister were watching their own angry takes and rage-filled tweets go viral, Ann Coulter, Candace Owens, and Jeanine Pirro were watching theirs do the same."],["p","This failure to parse politically inconvenient anger is, as Ogden Nash once put it, “a notable feat / of one-way thinking on a two-way street.” “Eloquent Rage,” “Good and Mad,” and “Rage Becomes Her” give little space to Sarah Palin, the women of the Tea Party, and the legions of women who—in what they, too, feel is an expression of righteous anger—lend their voices to the anti-abortion movement. All of the books do, however, acknowledge a fact that undercuts their attempts to valorize women’s anger: one of the angriest demographics in America before the 2016 Presidential election was white women, and the majority of them voted for Donald Trump."]],["inline-embed",{"type":"section","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22section%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cp%3EThat%20the%20words%20%E2%80%9CPresident%E2%80%9D%20and%20%E2%80%9CTrump%E2%80%9D%20came%20together%20anywhere%20outside%20of%20a%20Mad%20Lib%20is%20itself%20perhaps%20the%20most%20straightforward%20argument%20against%20anger%20as%20a%20political%20virtue.%20According%20to%20exit%20polls%20and%20endless%20postmortems%2C%20many%20people%20were%20so%20furious%20about%20immigration%2C%20the%20economy%2C%20the%20election%20of%20a%20black%20President%2C%20the%20potential%20for%20a%20female%20one%2C%20Black%20Lives%20Matter%2C%20the%20War%20on%20Christmas%2C%20and%20any%20number%20of%20other%20real%20and%20phantasmagorical%20issues%20that%20they%20voted%20for%20Trump.%20Was%20there%20ever%20a%20better%20example%20of%20blind%20rage%3F%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EThat%20blindness%20is%20one%20of%20the%20oldest%20objections%20to%20anger.%20The%20ancients%20generally%20regarded%20rage%20as%20uncontrollable%20and%20violent%3B%20it%20led%20to%20bad%20decisions%20and%20endangered%20the%20well-being%20of%20individuals%20and%20collectives.%20The%20University%20of%20Chicago%20professor%20Martha%20Nussbaum%20shares%20that%20view%2C%20and%2C%20unlike%20Chemaly%2C%20Cooper%2C%20and%20Traister%2C%20she%20is%20not%20sanguine%20about%20anger%20as%20a%20political%20tool.%20In%20%E2%80%9CThe%20Monarchy%20of%20Fear%3A%20A%20Philosopher%20Looks%20at%20Our%20Political%20Crisis%E2%80%9D%20(Simon%20%26amp%3B%20Schuster)%2C%20Nussbaum%20acknowledges%20the%20seductions%20of%20anger%20but%20warns%20against%20its%20side%20effects.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3E%E2%80%9CAnger%20is%20a%20poison%20to%20democratic%20politics%2C%20and%20it%20is%20all%20the%20worse%20when%20fueled%20by%20a%20lurking%20fear%20and%20sense%20of%20helplessness%2C%E2%80%9D%20Nussbaum%20writes.%20That%20is%20true%20regardless%20of%20the%20angry%20person%E2%80%99s%20gender%3A%20it%20clouds%20the%20judgment%20of%20men%20and%20women%20alike%2C%20and%20increases%20the%20likelihood%20of%20error.%20Because%20the%20sort%20of%20insults%20and%20injuries%20that%20provoke%20anger%20can%20occur%20by%20accident%2C%20and%20because%20their%20causes%20can%20be%20difficult%20to%20determine%2C%20it%20is%20easy%20to%20get%20angry%20at%20the%20wrong%20person%2C%20or%20to%20settle%20for%20a%20substitute%20for%20the%20unavailable%20or%20unknown%20source.%20Even%20if%20we%20accurately%20identify%20the%20responsible%20party%2C%20Nussbaum%20argues%2C%20we%20can%20still%20err%20in%20assessing%20the%20severity%20of%20the%20transgression%20or%20in%20selecting%20an%20appropriate%20response.%20Anger%2C%20according%20to%20this%20view%2C%20is%20almost%20always%20retributive%3B%20even%20when%20it%20does%20not%20seek%20personal%20redress%2C%20it%20demands%20the%20suffering%20of%20others.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EHistory%20is%20filled%20with%20examples%20of%20how%20easily%20anger%20can%20be%20exploited%20or%20manipulated%2C%20but%20Nussbaum%20summons%20from%20Greek%20tragedy%20an%20evocative%20illustration%20of%20how%20it%20can%20be%20redeemed.%20She%20tells%20the%20story%20of%20how%2C%20in%20the%20Oresteia%2C%20the%20Furies%2C%20vengeful%20beings%20that%20drip%20ooze%20from%20their%20eyes%20and%20vomit%20blood%2C%20are%20transformed%20into%20the%20Eumenides%2C%20beautiful%20creatures%20that%20serve%20justice%20rather%20than%20pursue%20cruelty.%20Athena%20establishes%20a%20system%20of%20law%2C%20and%20the%20changed%20Furies%20are%20part%20of%20its%20foundations.%20To%20Nussbaum%2C%20Aeschylus%20offers%20a%20metaphor%20for%20how%20individual%20passions%20can%20be%20tamed%20by%20reason%20and%20how%20collective%20anger%20can%20be%20converted%20to%20the%20cause%20of%20justice.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EOf%20course%2C%20classical%20mythology%20is%20one%20thing%20and%20contemporary%20reality%20is%20another.%20Yet%20resisting%20anger%20personally%20and%20rejecting%20it%20politically%20is%20a%20crucial%2C%20if%20never%20fully%20realizable%2C%20duty%20of%20democratic%20citizens.%20That%20may%20seem%20like%20a%20reactionary%20message%20for%20a%20political%20era%20such%20as%20ours%2C%20but%20it%20is%20worth%20remembering%20that%20this%20age%20of%20rage%20was%20preceded%2C%20for%20progressives%2C%20by%20an%20era%20of%20hope%2C%20and%20that%20earlier%20injustices%20have%20been%20fought%20by%20political%20movements%20devoted%20to%20peace%20and%20nonviolence.%20Nussbaum%20cites%20Mahatma%20Gandhi%2C%20Martin%20Luther%20King%2C%20Jr.%2C%20and%20Nelson%20Mandela%20in%20her%20account%20of%20protest%20without%20payback.%20(The%20fact%20that%20all%20three%20are%20men%20does%20not%2C%20needless%20to%20say%2C%20reflect%20a%20masculine%20attraction%20to%20nonviolence%20but%2C%20rather%2C%20our%20failure%20to%20canonize%20female%20political%20heroes.%20She%20could%20have%20written%20as%20convincingly%20about%20Susan%C2%A0B.%20Anthony%2C%20Ellen%20Johnson%20Sirleaf%2C%20and%20Clara%20Luper.)%20Nussbaum%20quotes%20King%20explaining%20that%2C%20though%2

the words “President” and “Trump” came together anywhere outside of a Mad Lib is itself perhaps the most straightforward argument against anger as a political virtue. According to exit polls and endless postmortems, many people were so furious about immigration, the economy, the election of a black President, the potential for a female one, Black Lives Matter, the War on Christmas, and any number of other real and phantasmagorical issues that they voted for Trump. Was there ever a better example of blind rage?"],["p","That blindness is one of the oldest objections to anger. The ancients generally regarded rage as uncontrollable and violent; it led to bad decisions and endangered the well-being of individuals and collectives. The University of Chicago professor Martha Nussbaum shares that view, and, unlike Chemaly, Cooper, and Traister, she is not sanguine about anger as a political tool. In “The Monarchy of Fear: A Philosopher Looks at Our Political Crisis” (Simon &amp; Schuster), Nussbaum acknowledges the seductions of anger but warns against its side effects."],["p","“Anger is a poison to democratic politics, and it is all the worse when fueled by a lurking fear and sense of helplessness,” Nussbaum writes. That is true regardless of the angry person’s gender: it clouds the judgment of men and women alike, and increases the likelihood of error. Because the sort of insults and injuries that provoke anger can occur by accident, and because their causes can be difficult to determine, it is easy to get angry at the wrong person, or to settle for a substitute for the unavailable or unknown source. Even if we accurately identify the responsible party, Nussbaum argues, we can still err in assessing the severity of the transgression or in selecting an appropriate response. Anger, according to this view, is almost always retributive; even when it does not seek personal redress, it demands the suffering of others."],["p","History is filled with examples of how easily anger can be exploited or manipulated, but Nussbaum summons from Greek tragedy an evocative illustration of how it can be redeemed. She tells the story of how, in the Oresteia, the Furies, vengeful beings that drip ooze from their eyes and vomit blood, are transformed into the Eumenides, beautiful creatures that serve justice rather than pursue cruelty. Athena establishes a system of law, and the changed Furies are part of its foundations. To Nussbaum, Aeschylus offers a metaphor for how individual passions can be tamed by reason and how collective anger can be converted to the cause of justice."],["p","Of course, classical mythology is one thing and contemporary reality is another. Yet resisting anger personally and rejecting it politically is a crucial, if never fully realizable, duty of democratic citizens. That may seem like a reactionary message for a political era such as ours, but it is worth remembering that this age of rage was preceded, for progressives, by an era of hope, and that earlier injustices have been fought by political movements devoted to peace and nonviolence. Nussbaum cites Mahatma Gandhi, Martin Luther King, Jr., and Nelson Mandela in her account of protest without payback. (The fact that all three are men does not, needless to say, reflect a masculine attraction to nonviolence but, rather, our failure to canonize female political heroes. She could have written as convincingly about Susan B. Anthony, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, and Clara Luper.) Nussbaum quotes King explaining that, though anger might have brought people to his protests, an essential task of the movement was to purify the emotion so that it could serve the cause of civil rights."],["p","That belief came partly from King’s deep theological commitment to nonviolence. But it may also reflect a tactical awareness that people who feel, even erroneously, that they are losing power can be angrier than those who are seeking it. It is the deforming nature of anger to blur the boundary between unjustified and justified; if it weren’t, only the righteous would ever be angry. Instead, rage is most often forsworn by those who seem most entitled to it, and civility is demanded by those who least deserve it. The civil-rights marchers and the Freedom Riders were the ones with the calm clarity of the Eumenides, while their white neighbors were the ones who looked and sounded like the Furies."]],["inline-embed",{"type":"section","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22section%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cp%3EAll%20these%20authors%20are%20right%20to%20note%20that%20a%20major%20problem%20with%20anger%20is%20that%20some%20people%20are%20allowed%20to%20express%20it%20while%20others%20are%20not.%20That%20disparity%20was%20vividly%20on%20view%20during%20the%20recent%20Senate%20Judiciary%20Committee%20hearing%20in%20which%20Christine%20Blasey%20Ford%20calmly%20testified%20about%20being%20sexually%20assaulted%20in%20high%20school%20and%20her%20alleged%20attacker%2C%20the%20Supreme%20Court%20nominee%20Brett%20Kavanaugh%2C%20seethed%20and%20shouted%20at%20the%20senators%2C%20behavior%20that%20was%20applauded%20by%20conservative%20pundits%20and%20politicians%20as%20evidence%20of%20his%20innocence.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EIt%20was%20an%20upsetting%20display%2C%20and%20hardly%20one%20to%20make%20the%20case%20for%20the%20virtues%20of%20anger%20in%20the%20political%20arena.%20Indeed%2C%20the%20hearing%20suggests%20that%2C%20instead%20of%20encouraging%20rage%20from%20people%20who%20have%20traditionally%20been%20denied%20it%2C%20we%20might%20be%20better%20off%20defusing%20it%20in%20those%20traditionally%20rewarded%20for%20it%E2%80%94not%20only%20for%20the%20sake%20of%20our%20democracy%20but%20for%20ourselves.%20However%20efficacious%20anger%20may%20seem%20in%20the%20short%20term%2C%20even%20righteous%20anger%20is%20likely%20to%20be%20deleterious%20in%20the%20long%20term%2C%20to%20the%20individual%20body%20and%20to%20the%20body%20politic.%20Repressed%20emotions%20are%20dangerous%2C%20but%2C%20as%20countless%20medical%20studies%20have%20shown%2C%20sustained%20anger%20is%20both%20physically%20and%20emotionally%20destructive.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EWomen%20have%20every%20reason%20to%20be%20livid%20right%20now%2C%20and%20our%20anger%20should%20not%20be%20mocked%2C%20censored%2C%20or%20punished.%20But%20that%20does%20not%20mean%20it%20must%20be%20celebrated%2C%20or%20that%20hard-won%20efforts%20to%20manage%20anger%20and%20discourage%20aggression%20in%20the%20general%20population%20should%20be%20reversed.%20Tellingly%2C%20Cooper%E2%80%99s%20book%20concludes%20with%20a%20meditation%20on%20joy%2C%20a%20benediction%20of%20sorts%20that%20ends%20with%20a%20reminder%3A%20%E2%80%9CWhat%20you%20build%20is%20infinitely%20more%20important%20than%20what%20you%20tear%20down.%E2%80%9D%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EAnger%20is%20an%20avaricious%20emotion%3B%20it%20takes%20more%20credit%20than%20it%20deserves.%20Attempts%20to%20make%20it%20into%20a%20political%20virtue%20too%20often%20attribute%20to%20anger%20victories%20that%20rightfully%20belong%20to%20courage%2C%20patience%2C%20intelligence%2C%20persistence%2C%20or%20love.%20These%20days%2C%20we%20remember%20Carry%20Nation%E2%80%99s%20hatchets%2C%20but%20forget%20that%20she%20sold%20souvenir%20versions%20of%20them%20and%20used%20the%20proceeds%20not%20only%20to%20pay%20her%20own%20bail%20but%20also%20to%20support%20a%20shelter%20for%20the%20wives%2C%20mothers%2C%20and%20children%20of%20alcoholics.%20Nation%E2%80%99s%20anger%20accounts%20for%20only%20a%20sliver%20of%20her%20political%20activism%3B%20the%20majority%20of%20her%20life%20was%20spent%20in%20constructive%20rather%20than%20reactive%20efforts%2C%20and%20it%20was%20also%20spent%20in%20community%20with%20other%20activists%2C%20through%20the%20Woman%E2%80%99s%20Christian%20Temperance%20Union.%20Such%20solidarity%2C%20rather%20than%20the%20rage%20that%20occasioned%20it%2C%20feels%20like%20the%20secret%20subject%20of%20these%20new%20books.%20What%20is%20powerful%20isn%E2%80%99t%20so%20much%20women%E2%80%99s%20anger%20as%20their%20collective%20action.%20That%20is%20what%20has%20changed%20most%20radically%20since%20this%20past%20election%2C%20hopefully%20not%20in%20a%20burst%20of%20rebellion%20but%20in%20a%20revolution%20of%20lasting%20consequence.%C2%A0%E2%99%A6%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%22%7D","ref":""},["p","All these authors are right to note that a major problem with anger is that some people are allowed to express it while others are not. That disparity was vividly on view during the recent Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Christine Blasey Ford calmly testified about being sexually assaulted in high school and her alleged attacker, the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, seethed and shouted at the senators, behavior that was applauded by conservative pundits and politicians as evidence of his innocence."],["p","It was an upsetting display, and hardly one to make the case for the virtues of anger in the political arena. Indeed, the hearing suggests that, instead of encouraging rage from people who have traditionally been denied it, we might be better off defusing it in those traditionally rewarded for it—not only for the sake of our democracy but for ourselves. However efficacious anger may seem in the short term, even righteous anger is likely to be deleterious in the long term, to the individual body and to the body politic. Repressed emotions are dangerous, but, as countless medical studies have shown, sustained anger is both physically and emotionally destructive."],["p","Women have every reason to be livid right now, and our anger should not be mocked, censored, or punished. But that does not mean it must be celebrated, or that hard-won efforts to manage anger and discourage aggression in the general population should be reversed. Tellingly, Cooper’s book concludes with a meditation on joy, a benediction of sorts that ends with a reminder: “What you build is infinitely more important than what you tear down.”"],["p","Anger is an avaricious emotion; it takes more credit than it deserves. Attempts to make it into a political virtue too often attribute to anger victories that rightfully belong to courage, patience, intelligence, persistence, or love. These days, we remember Carry Nation’s hatchets, but forget that she sold souvenir versions of them and used the proceeds not only to pay her own bail but also to support a shelter for the wives, mothers, and children of alcoholics. Nation’s anger accounts for only a sliver of her political activism; the majority of her life was spent in constructive rather than reactive efforts, and it was also spent in community with other activists, through the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union. Such solidarity, rather than the rage that occasioned it, feels like the secret subject of these new books. What is powerful isn’t so much women’s anger as their collective action. That is what has changed most radically since this past election, hopefully not in a burst of rebellion but in a revolution of lasting consequence. ♦"]]],"canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"sections":[{"id":"59babd482af19b1403458545","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"59babd482af19b1403458545","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Books","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"books"},{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"},{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"}],"name":"Books","parent":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"},"slug":"books"},{"id":"5907ef77019dfc3494e9c911","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Books","parent":[],"photos":{},"slug":"books-tag"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"magazine","contentTags":[],"contentType":"article","contributors":[{"name":"Casey Cep","type":"author","title":"Casey Cep is a writer from the Eastern Shore of Maryland.

the Supreme Court nomination of Brett Kavanaugh, three women who belong to an art-activist collective called the Illuminator parked their battered white van near Union Square and unloaded crates of heavy equipment onto a hand truck. The van was unmarked, and its interior was plastered with stickers: “Oppression Makes Us Sick”; “Revolución Empieza en Casa.” In the back was a homemade platform that could hold a powerful projector and be periscoped through the roof."],["p","The Illuminator—made up of a small group of New Yorkers whose day jobs range from archivist to adjunct professor—casts progressive messages onto the sides of buildings. (The group’s tagline is “Shining a light on the urgent issues of our time.”) Its communiqués are bumper-sticker short and bat-signal large.

The Illuminators on call were Emily Andersen, Zoe Bachman, and Rachel Brown. They were dressed in dark clothing and comfortable shoes, and they ranged in age from twenty-eight to thirty-seven. The group’s members aren’t anonymous: its Web site lists nine active participants. “We amplify the voices of the unheard,” Bachman said. “We all have social media, but we don’t have millions of dollars to put up our own billboards or have our own TV shows.”"],["p","The Illuminators’ tactics may or may not be welcome, depending on the jurisdiction. Usually, they stop the van, raise the periscope, and point the projector at their target, but in Union Square they’d decided to project from ground level. A little after 9 ",["em",{"class":"small"},"P.M"],"., Andersen, Bachman, and Brown wheeled their gear, which included a small gas generator, to a patch of green adjacent to the park, and set up near a clump of fading hydrangeas. Some passersby were walking home from the gym or from dinner. Others milled around the bronze statue of George Washington in the center of the park."],["p","Andersen connected a laptop to the projector, and began fiddling with photos and text. Suddenly, an arresting image lit up the wall above the Citibank: Anita Hill’s face, during her 1991 testimony against the then Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas. “Can you get her any higher?” Bachman asked."],["p","“That’s as high as she’ll go,” Andersen said. She fiddled some more, and Hill’s picture was replaced by ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/christine-blasey-ford"},"Christine Blasey Ford"]," swearing to tell the truth at a recent Senate hearing; she has accused ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/brett-kavanaugh"},"Kavanaugh"]," of sexually assaulting her when they were teen-agers. Andersen added a caption: “",["em",{"class":"small"},"BELIEVE WOMEN"],".”"],["p","A few people stopped to watch. “Is this, like, illegal?” Adam Jacobs, an English-education major at N.Y.U., asked."],["p","“Nope,” Andersen said. The scent of car exhaust and marijuana wafted through the square. An ice-cream truck was playing “Pop Goes the Weasel.” Bachman asked, “Is it possible to get both of them up there at once?”"],["p","Andersen pushed a button, and the women appeared side by side on the building, Ford gazing toward George Washington, Hill toward a Panera Bread. “Yeah, that’s better,” Brown said. “It’s warmer.”"],["p","A young man approached the Illuminators and asked if they were “open for conversation.” He said, “I don’t mean to sound confrontational, but how do you get the confidence to say, ‘I believe’? I feel like evidence is still coming out.” Bachman said that she found Ford to be credible, and the man agreed. “But, then again, I’m trying to be very logical,” he said. “My heart says believe her, but my brain says I need facts.”"],["p","A mother and daughter stopped to talk. “This is amazing!” the mother, Susan Barrie, exclaimed. They’d just left a play about Gloria Steinem, and she said that it had made her think: “We are in such a bubble here in New York. Abortion’s been legal my entire adult life—so we don’t get it.”"],["p","At ten-thirty, the generator sputtered to a stop. The façade went dark. “Oh, shit,” Andersen said. “Guess there wasn’t enough gas in there.” The location had been perfect: a relatively smooth, nonreflective surface with minimal light pollution. “A lot of people ask us to do Trump Tower,” Bachman said. “But it’s no good. It’s all glass.” ♦"]]],"canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"sections":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"},"slug":"magazine","children":[{"id":"5bb81061742f932cbcb7a3f2","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5bb81061742f932cbcb7a3f2","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Undercover","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"undercover"},{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"},{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"}],"name":"Undercover","parent":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"},"slug":"undercover"}]}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"magazine","contentTags":[{"name":"Brett Kavanaugh","url":"/tag/brett-kavanaugh"},{"name":"Anita Hill","url":"/tag/anita-hill"},{"name":"Christine Blasey Ford","url":"/tag/christine-blasey-ford"},{"name":"Supreme Court","url":"/tag/supreme-court"},{"name":"#MeToo","url":"/tag/metoo"},{"name":"Protest","url":"/tag/protest"}],"contentType":"article","contributors":[{"name":"Paige Williams","type":"author","title":"Paige Williams, the Laventhol/Newsday Visiting Professor at Columbia University’s Graduate School of Journalism, became a staff writer at \u003cem&gt;The New Yorker\u003c/em&gt; in 2015.","email":"","bio":["div",["p","Paige Williams began writing for ",["em","The New Yorker"]," in 2013 and became a staff writer in 2015.

alone in his dead uncle’s cottage, and with the burden lately of wandering thoughts in the night, Seamus Ferris had fallen hard for a Polish girl who worked at a café down in Carrick. He had himself almost convinced that the situation had the dimensions of a love affair, though in fact he’d exchanged no more than a few dozen words with her, whenever she named the price for his flat white and scone, and he shyly paid it, offering a line or two himself on the busyness of the town or the fineness of the weather."],["p","“It’s like France,” he said to her one sunny morning in June."],["p","And it was true that the fields of the mountain had all the week idled in what seemed a Continental languor, and the lower hills east were a Provençal blue in the haze, and the lake when he lowered himself into it was so warm by the evening it didn’t even make his midge bites sting."],["p","“The heat,” he tried again. “Makes the place seem like France. We wouldn’t be used to it. Passing out from it. Ambulance on standby.”"],["p","His words blurted at the burn of her brown-eyed stare. She didn’t lose the run of herself by way of a response but she said yes, it is very hot, and he believed that something at least cousinly to a smile softened her mouth and moved across her eyes. He had learned already by listening in the café that her name was Katherine, which was not what you’d expect for a Polish woman but lovely."],["p","At thirty-five years of age, Seamus Ferris was by no means setting the night on fire at the damp old pebble-dash cottage on Dromord Hill, but he had no mortgage nor rent to pay, and there was money from when the father died, a bit more again when the mother went to join him, also the redundancy payment from Rel-Tech, and some dole. He had neither sister nor brother and was a little stunned at this relatively young age to find himself on a solo run through life. He had pulled back from his friends, too, which wasn’t much of a job, for he had never had close ones. He had worked for eight years at Rel-Tech, but more and more he had found the banter of the other men there a trial, the endless football talk, the foolishness and bragging about drink and women, and in truth he was relieved when the chance of a redundancy came up. He had the misfortune in life to be fastidious and to own a delicacy of feeling. He drank wine rather than beer and favored French films. Such an oddity this made him in the district that he might as well have had three heads up on Dromord Hill."],["p","He believed that Katherine, too, had sensitivity. She had a dreamy, distracted air, and there was no question but that she seemed at a remove from the other mullockers who worked in the café. The way she made the short walk home in the evenings to the apartments across the river in Cortober again named a sensitivity—she always slowed a little to look out and over the water, maybe to see what the weather was doing, perhaps she even read the river light, as Seamus did, fastidiously. He could keep track of her route home if he parked down by the boathouse, see the slender woman with brown hair slow and turn to look over the water, and it was only with a weight of reluctance that she moved on again for home."],["p","In the sleepless nights of the early summer his mind ran dangerously across her contours. He played out many scenarios that might occur in the café, or around town, or maybe on a Sunday walk through the fields by the lake. It was a more than slightly different version of himself that acted his part in these happy scenes: Seamus as a confident and blithe man, but also warm and generous, and possessed of a bedroom manner suave enough to insure that the previously reticent Polish girl concluded his reveries roaring the head off herself in gales of sexual transport. Each morning when he awoke once more in an aroused state—there was no mercy—it was of Katherine from the café that he thought. She was pretty but by no means a supermodel, not like some of the Eastern Europeans, with their cheekbones like blades, and as Seamus was not himself hideous, he felt he might have a chance in forgiving light. All he had to do was string out the few words right in his mouth."],["p","He was in the café by now four or five times a week, and she was almost always on. The once or twice she hadn’t been were occasions of crushing disappointment, and he’d glared hard at the mullockers, as they bickered and barked like seals over the trays of buns and cakes. Even the hissing spout of the coffee machine was an intense annoyance when Katherine wasn’t there. Along with its delicacy, Seamus’s mind had, too, a criminal tendency—this is often the way—a kind of native sneakiness, though he would have been surprised to have been told this. The café’s toilet was located right by the kitchen, and Seamus could not but notice what looked like a rota pinned to the back of the kitchen door. Catching his breath one Monday morning, he reached in with his phone and took a photograph, and in this way he had her hours for the week got. Also, her full name."],["inline-embed",{"type":"callout","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22callout%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22align-center%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cp%3E%E2%80%A2%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%22%2C%22attrs%22%3A%7B%7D%7D","ref":""},["p","•"]],["p","Katherine Zielinski she was called, and he wasn’t back in the van before he had it Googled—it might be unusual enough inside quote marks to give quick results, and indeed within seconds he was poring over an Instagram account in her name. The lovely profile picture confirmed her identity—it was his Katherine all right, with her fourteen followers. She had posted only six times, six images, going back to the January previous, and relief flooded through him like an opiate when he found no photos of a boyfriend nor of a baby. It was something more intense than an opiate that went through him when he studied the most recent post, which was from the weekend just gone. It was of Katherine’s right hand resting on the bare thighs revealed by her shortish denim skirt, and in the hand she clutched a slim box set—it was “Tales of the Four Seasons,” four films by Eric Rohmer. Her accompanying caption read, “",["em","Goracy"]," weekend.”"],["p","It was a swift job to go to Google Translate with that and find that it meant, merely, “Hot weekend.” She had humor as well as taste, it appeared, though in truth Seamie Ferris wouldn’t be putting Rohmer at the top of the league in terms of the French directors; he would in fact rate him no more than highish in the second division, but at least he might be able to argue to her a rationale for this. Her knees were lovely and brown, though possibly a little thickset, but as it was a case of Mother Fist and her Five Daughters up in the pebble-dash cottage, this was not a deal-breaker."],["p","He spent time with the other images. He tried to decipher them or, more exactly, to decipher from them something of her character. Her only other personal appearance was in a blurry selfie that showed her reflection in a rain-spattered windowpane and that was suggestive, somehow, of Katherine as a solitary. There was a poor vista of the river from the bridge at evening. The rest of the images were reposted from other accounts—someone’s pencil drawing of Sufjan Stevens; a cityscape that might have been of the Polish winter, its streetlights a cold amber; and, finally, a live shot of Beyoncé at a concert in Brazil in the stance of some new and utterly undefeatable sexual warrior. These images spoke to Seamus Ferris, in a low, insistent drone, of a yearning he recognized, and he felt that now he should end his playacting and confide his feelings to the woman."],["p","The idea sent him into a fetal huddle on the couch, his back turned to the hot afternoon sun that poured through the window to show up the cottage in its bachelor meanness. The strangest thing he had learned while alone in his mid-thirties was about the length of the nights. They were never-fucking-ending. They opened out like bleak continents. They were landscapes sombre and with twisted figures. He lay there and flopped and muttered on the couch until the darkness again fell on Dromord Hill and the extent of the night shamelessly presented itself. He felt backed into a corner. He would have to ask her out. The worst that could happen was a refusal and the subsequent embarrassment of that, but there are worse things than embarrassment, he had learned in the night, when his mind wandered across such things."],["p","In the auditing of the night a plan had been laid down. He would raise the question on a Thursday morning, and so he had not shaved since the Monday—this provided a shadow of interest across what was in truth a weakish jawline. He scratched at the stubbles helplessly as he picked at his scone, sipped at the cooling coffee. His stomach tumbled and spoke. He would leave it until he was ready to depart, and if he was refused at least he would be out the door and could go and fuck himself into the Shannon. He was about to stand and make grimly for the counter—he felt like a man heading off to be shot—when she stepped out from behind it and for absolutely no good reason came to saunter around his table, looking out at the rain that as sure as Jesus had returned to make another wet joke of the summer."],["p","“Back to the usual,” she said."],["p","“You’d nearly do away with yourself altogether,” Seamus Ferris said."],["p","“What do you mean?” she said."],["p","“Nothing by it,” he said. “Do you want to go out with me sometime?”"],["p","“That will be fine,” she said. “When is this happening?”"],["inline-embed",{"type":"callout","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22callout%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22align-center%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cp%3E%E2%80%A2%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%22%2C%22attrs%22%3A%7B%7D%7D","ref":""},["p","•"]],["p","He believed now that they were in telepathic contact with each other. She must have known and read his intention. She must have known, too, that he had sensed her likely compliance. This was how fatedness worked, how love discovered itself. In the long three days, the endless three nights that led up to their Sunday meeting, he attempted to send mental messages down Dromord Hill and across the slow meander of the river. The content of these messages was even to himself uncertain but had to do with ardency and truth."],["p","The Sunday of their arrangement came up to dense clouds and a heavy mugginess. He went to the toilet five times in the morning and took Imodium against the thunder of his insides. Attraction as physical catastrophe was not exactly news to Seamus Ferris. He had been besotted before. Always it was with slightly humorless-looking women who appeared to be in a condition of vague disbelief about the world. If involved in any level of romance, he was given to lurchy moves and hot declarations, and always in the past he had scared the women off within a few dates. He had not had anything even close to sex for three years. With his Katherine he vowed that all would be different."],["p","He met her by the bridge at three—the arrangement was for a spin in the van."],["p","“Have you ever been to the coast of Leitrim?” he asked her, unpromisingly."],["p","“No,” she said. “It has a coast?”"],["p","“The coast of Leitrim,” he said, “is four kilometres long.

He tried to let her know that he needed her badly and that in his own modest way he was a prospect. He told her that he had a house that wanted work but was situated well. There were few bills.

Like the Elio character in “Call Me by Your Name,” Guadagnino, who is forty-seven, was a skinny gay teen-ager during the eighties, and many people took that film to be a veiled memoir. In fact, Guadagnino says, he felt no more connection with the story than with any other he’d put on the screen. “Suspiria” is different. He has hoped to make the film for more than thirty years. Where Argento’s version, set at a dance school, was brightly colored and campy, Guadagnino builds his setting unironically, in layers, from a Fassbinderian backdrop of browns and blues and grays. The movie reaches downward, to Germany’s ugly past treatment of bodies, and upward, to a mental realm of ritual and symbol: Freudian, creative, and occult. And it tells a coming-of-age story about mastering creative and destructive strength. “Suspiria” is very much a horror film: flesh is ripped; bones are broken; heads explode.

the editing room the next day, Guadagnino was in one of his favorite states: surrounded at work by an eclectic group of friends. “Wow!” he exclaimed as new visitors arrived, rushing forward to embrace them. “Look who’s here!” (“There are always people visiting on set—always,” Dakota Johnson reports. “It’s absurd.”)"],["p","Although Guadagnino never went to film school, there is something of the dorm-room atelier in the way he fills his life and his credits with trusted comrades, handing out filmmaking tasks like chores. The writer of one film might do marketing for another. Of three male actors listed in the main credits of “Suspiria” (the cast is otherwise thirty-eight women), one is a distinguished cinematographer and another is an architectural photographer. The third—Lutz Ebersdorf, the actor playing the old psychoanalyst, about whom Guadagnino avidly sought all visitors’ opinions—had never been seen on a set before. “Luca’s approach can be very disorienting for new collaborators,” says Fasano, who has been the film editor on all of Guadagnino’s features but also, variously, a co-director, an assistant director, a screenwriter, and a composer. Guadagnino’s approach transgresses many of the industry’s usual hierarchies. “Normally, as a writer in Hollywood, you’re hired as a kind of builder—it’s your work ethic that’s valued,” David Kajganich, the screenwriter of “Suspiria” and “A Bigger Splash,” says. “With Luca, I was part of the prep conversations. I was part of the casting conversations. I was part of conversations about location. Actually writing the script is probably one-fifth of our collaboration.”"],["p","That afternoon’s passing circle included Carlo Antonelli, formerly the editor of Italian ",["em","Rolling Stone"],", Italian ",["em","Wired"],", and Italian ",["em","GQ"]," but also a Guadagnino actor, writer, and producer; Lisa Muskat, who produces indie films; and Sheikh Mubarak Al-Sabah, a young Kuwaiti aristocrat whom Guadagnino met at Fashion Week. Ferdinando Cito Filomarino, whom he refers to as “my sentimental partner,” circulated briskly through the studio all day. They met ten years ago, on the set of “I Am Love,” for which Cito Filomarino was an assistant director. Now a sandy-haired thirty-one-year-old, Cito Filomarino released his own first feature in 2015, and is about to shoot his English-language début."],["p","Guadagnino has never dated anyone who isn’t a director. He says that he views the common turf as the basis for creative partnership, not as a threat. He and Cito Filomarino mostly agree about movies, except the ones they see on airplanes—the cabin air makes Guadagnino sentimental, and unduly prone to weep over treacly turns of plot—and they pitch in on each other’s work. “I truly don’t understand competition,” Guadagnino says. Many darker humors seem foreign to him or extremely well suppressed."],["p","“You see him get frustrated or upset at things, but it’s never a lingering thing,” says Armie Hammer, whose wife took to calling Guadagnino’s vibe on set “vacation mode.” For Hammer, this became its own style of instruction. “Between setups, Luca would pull a chair into the sun, unbutton a couple of buttons on his shirt, lean his head back, and enjoy the place where he was,” he says. “Having that example, day in and day out, helped us all capture what it felt like in the eighties.” Lessons went past the Martini hour. “Normally, everyone is, like, ‘All right, everybody, fuck off—I want a few hours to myself.’ Luca is, like, ‘Come over to my house. We’re going to have dinner, talk about what we did today, and then watch a movie and discuss what it has to do with tomorrow.’ ” Hammer describes the approach as “holistic”: “You’re not just there for the process of filming. You’re there to live in Luca’s universe.”"],["p","“Suspiria,” though, tried Guadagnino’s easygoing flow. The film was shot mostly in winter, in an abandoned hotel on a mountain in Varese. Because there was no heating, and because the cast included dozens of women wearing dance attire, the crew had to fire up smoky gasoline heaters between takes. “The building was like its own horror movie,” a visitor to the set recalls. “The toilets looked as if they’d been used for some sort of satanic ritual.” Chaos and discomfort don’t sit well with Guadagnino, who, while meeting with an executive from Amazon Studios—which is co-producing the film—in his Rome hotel that morning, had ordered a bottle of water and a pot of tea and then cheerily sent both back: the water had been slightly cooler than room temperature (“",["em","Very"]," bad for the bowels”), and the tea—well, somehow it had been mis-brewed."],["p","Such precision imposes certain constraints. Guadagnino doesn’t think of himself as an Italian director, and he has never made a film in the Italian production system. “I don’t understand the imagery of Italian cinema,” he says. “I don’t understand what they’re doing and how I can fit into its mold.” The most American thing about his films, today, might be the masks they wear—a realism based not on classical beacons of meaning but on the veils of wishfulness and contradiction which obscure such meanings in the human wild. For weeks, he wanted to cut from “Call Me by Your Name” a scene in which Elio masturbates with a peach: the metaphor struck him as too unsublimated. He also doubted that the act was physically possible; eventually, both he and Chalamet satisfied themselves that it was."],["p","“When I hear the words ‘aesthetics’ and ‘style,’ I get incredibly uncomfortable—I’m not striving for a beautiful image, an Instagram shot,” Guadagnino says. (He speaks English in bursts of industrious clatter, as if typing, with the faintest hint of a childhood lisp.) “You are pointing the camera toward a ",["em","phenomenology"]," of reality. And movies have the capacity to query what you see.”"],["p","When Guadagnino starts a movie, he works to build up the layers of a world with intense specificity—the feel of the buildings, the labels of the shirts—in order to help the characters find their pleasures and defenses among them. In this way, the old becomes new. “Suspiria” is Guadagnino’s second full-length remake; his first, “A Bigger Splash,” interpreted Jacques Deray’s “",["a",{"href":"https://www.amazon.com/Piscine-English-Subtitled-Alain-Delon/dp/B009ASU1JI/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1539013729&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=La+Piscine"},"La Piscine"],"” (1970), a movie that he did not like. But his remakes are less like remodelling old structures than like raising entirely different buildings on their foundations. “When you think of something being remade, you automatically make it contemporary—you industrialize it,” Dakota Johnson says. Guadagnino does something else. His version of “Suspiria” is set in 1977, the year that the original came out. He started recruiting for it, quite informally, while working on “A Bigger Splash.” (“He pulled me aside and whispered, ‘Soospeeriahhh!’ ” Johnson recalls. “I said, ‘",["em","What"],"?’ ”) He never auditions actors; he just sits with them and talks."],["p","By then, he and Swinton had been planning the movie for more than a decade. Her character, Madame Blanc, is one of several older women who play a mysterious leadership role at the Markos Dance Company. Totemic themes—power, the kind you find within and the kind you wield in relationships; physical pain, inflicted both directly and at a remove; and guilt, both personal and cultural—weave through the film. As the older women pass along their training, some of the younger dancers try to shake off their lineal power, and suffer for it. “",["em","Sie sind Hexen!"]," ”—“They are witches!”—Moretz’s character murmurs before she disappears. Guadagnino describes his remake as “a movie about motherhood.”"]],["inline-embed",{"type":"section","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22section%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cp%3EIn%202010%2C%20Guadagnino%20bought%20an%20apartment%20on%20the%20second%20floor%20of%20a%20derelict%20eighteenth-century%20palazzo%20in%20Crema%2C%20an%20hour%20east%20of%20Milan%2C%20and%20managed%20its%20renovation%20himself.%20Today%2C%20mid-century%20furniture%20and%20carpets%20cover%20its%20stone%20floors%3B%20peeling%20green%20shutters%20frame%20eggplant%20walls%3B%20built-in%20shelves%20bear%20books%2C%20CDs%2C%20and%20DVDs%3B%20a%20large%20screen%20hangs%20for%20the%20projection%20of%20films.%20He%20used%20the%20grounds%20in%20filming%20%E2%80%9CCall%20Me%20by%20Your%20Name%E2%80%9D%E2%80%94a%20decision%20that%20he%20now%20regrets.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3E%E2%80%9CI%20don%E2%80%99t%20have%20to%20make%20the%20mistake%20again%20of%20shooting%20a%20film%20where%20I%20live%2C%E2%80%9D%20he%20says.%20The%20town%20has%20lost%20its%20%E2%80%9Cvirgin%E2%80%9D%20aura%20and%20mystique%20for%20him%2C%20and%2C%20increasingly%2C%20he%20finds%20himself%20accosted%20by%20palazzo%20pilgrims%3A%20%E2%80%9CStrangers%20come%20up%20to%20me%20and%20say%2C%20%E2%80%98I%20love%20your%20house!%E2%80%99%C2%A0%E2%80%9D%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22callout%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522callout%2522%252C%2522name%2522%253A%2522feature-small%2522%252C%2522body%2522%253A%2522%253Cinline-embed%2520type%253D%255C%2522image%255C%2522%2520meta%253D%255C%2522%25257B%252522type%252522%25253A%252522image%252522%25252C%252522url%252522%25253A%252522%25252Fphotos%25252F5bb53e5efae4412cdecfd8b9%252522%25252C%252522width%252522%25253A%252522%252522%25252C%252522height%252522%25253A%252522%252522%25252C%252522caption%252522%25253A%252522%252522%25257D%255C%2522%2520ref%253D%255C%25225bb53e5efae4412cdecfd8b9%255C%2522%253E%253C%252Finline-embed%253E%2522%252C%2522attrs%2522%253A%257B%257D%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%22%5C%22%3E%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22image%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522image%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%2522%252Fphotos%252F5bb53e5efae4412cdecfd8b9%2522%252C%2522width%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522height%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522caption%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%225bb53e5efae4412cdecfd8b9%5C%22%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%3Cp%3ELeaving%20Crema%20poses%20complications%2C%20though%2C%20because%2C%20a%20year%20ago%2C%20Guadagnino%20moved%20his%20parents%20from%20Rome%20to%20an%20apartment%20a%20few%20blocks%20away%E2%80%94with%20some%20reluctance%20on%20their%20part.%20Guadagnino%E2%80%99s%20mother%20is%20Algerian%2C%20but%20she%20was%20brought%20up%20in%20Casablanca.%20She%20was%20nineteen%20when%20she%20met%20his%20father%2C%20an%20Italian%20teacher%20sent%20to%20Morocco%20at%20the%20behest%20of%20the%20Italian%20Foreign%20Ministry.%20They%20went%20to%20Scotland%2C%20where%20she%20could%20marry%20without%20parental%20consent.%20%E2%80%9CMy%20mother%2C%20in%20a%20way%2C%20performed%20a%20very%20courageous%20and%20bold%20act%20of%20transgression%2C%E2%80%9D%20Guadagnino%20says.%20A%20few%20years%20later%2C%20his%20father%20got%20a%20teaching%20job%20in%20Ethiopia%2C%20so%20they%20moved.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EGuadagnino%20has%20dreamlike%20memories%20of%20East%20Africa.%20His%20parents%E2%80%99%20home%20had%20fruit%20trees%20and%20a%20vegetable%20garden.%20He%20learned%20to%20cook%20by%20picking%20produce%20and%20watching%20it%20being%20turned%20into%20meals.%20When%20he%20was%20four%2C%20he%20saw%20%E2%80%9CLawrence%20of%20Arabia%2C%E2%80%9D%20on%20his%20mother%E2%80%99s%20lap.%20%E2%80%9CI%20think%20something%20must%20have%20sparked%20in%20him%20then%2C%E2%80%9D%20she%20says.%20%E2%80%9CMy%20husband%20and%20I%20knew%20nothing%20about%20cinema.%E2%80%9D%20At%20nine%2C%20he%20saw%20%E2%80%9C%3Ca%20href%3D%5C%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB000I9YLWG%3Fref%3Dsr_1_1_acs_kn_imdb_pa_dp%26amp%3Bqid%3D1539013767%26amp%3Bsr%3D1-1-acs%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%5C%22%3EPsycho%3C%2Fa%3E%2C%E2%80%9D%20and%20was%20astonished%20by%20the%20man%20playing%20his%20own%20mother%20in%20drag.%20That%20was%20around%20the%20time%20Guadagnino%20started%20telling%20adults%20that%20he%20wanted%20to%20be%20a%20film%20director.%20His%20father%20thought%20he%20should%20be%20a%20teacher%2C%20but%20his%20mother%20got%20him%20a%20Super%208%20camera.%20%E2%80%9CThat%20was%20my%20introduction%3A%20solitary%2C%20completely%20guerrilla%2C%20unaware%20of%20the%20medium%E2%80%94the%20%3Cem%3Eopposite%3C%2Fem%3E%20of%20those%20beautiful%20short%20films%20from%20Mr.%20Spielberg%20when%20he%20was%20young%2C%E2%80%9D%20Guadagnino%20says.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EIn%201977%2C%20the%20Guadagninos%20moved%20to%20Palermo%2C%20in%20Sicily%2C%20to%20escape%20the%20Ethiopian%20civil%20war.%20%E2%80%9CI%20wasn%E2%80%99t%20used%20to%20having%20all%20these%20buildings%20around%20me%2C%E2%80%9D%20Guadagnino%20says.%20To%20this%20day%2C%20he%20feels%20restless%20in%20tight%20places%2C%20a

Guadagnino’s mother is Algerian, but she was brought up in Casablanca. She was nineteen when she met his father, an Italian teacher sent to Morocco at the behest of the Italian Foreign Ministry. They went to Scotland, where she could marry without parental consent. “My mother, in a way, performed a very courageous and bold act of transgression,” Guadagnino says. A few years later, his father got a teaching job in Ethiopia, so they moved."],["p","Guadagnino has dreamlike memories of East Africa. His parents’ home had fruit trees and a vegetable garden. He learned to cook by picking produce and watching it being turned into meals.

That was around the time Guadagnino started telling adults that he wanted to be a film director. His father thought he should be a teacher, but his mother got him a Super 8 camera. “That was my introduction: solitary, completely guerrilla, unaware of the medium—the ",["em","opposite"]," of those beautiful short films from Mr. Spielberg when he was young,” Guadagnino says."],["p","In 1977, the Guadagninos moved to Palermo, in Sicily, to escape the Ethiopian civil war. “I wasn’t used to having all these buildings around me,” Guadagnino says. To this day, he feels restless in tight places, and his favorite season is winter, which hollows out the landscape. (Many of his films are set in snow.) At school, another student called him “",["em","il negro,"],"” on account of his half-Algerian complexion, which bemused him—it was his first experience of feeling socially bound to an identity. He turned inward. “Luca was always reading a book,” his mother says."],["p","In adolescence, he began to approach film systematically, watching everything he could, reading biographies of major directors, and studying the history of the craft. He would program VHS recordings from TV, but he rarely got the timings right, so many films in his collection had no ending, and some had no beginning, either."],["p","Today, Guadagnino thinks of these years fondly—an impulse he has learned to examine. When he was thirty-eight, he went to see a famous Jungian in Rome, his first foray into therapy. “She said to me, ‘So, describe yourself. What is your relationship with your parents?’ And I said, ‘Oh, it’s fantastic.’ ” Guadagnino talked and talked, and, when he rose to go, the therapist told him not to return. “She said to me, ‘Come

Guadagnino was ten, he was walking in a small town on the Adriatic coast which had emptied out for the summer holidays. The local movie house was closed, but some posters there caught his eye. “There was this ballerina with a severed head and the blood going from the neck to the vagina,” he recalls. “And there was writing, very ominous: ‘",["em",{"class":"small"},"SUSPIRIA"],".’ ”"],["p","Four years later, he saw “Suspiria” on TV, alone in his room, with the door closed. “I was terrified but mesmerized,” he says. The film became his shorthand for a memory of early-adolescent autonomy: the thrilling feeling of first pulling away, burrowing down, and becoming himself. It was a landmark in his own coming of age."],["p","In high school, Guadagnino learned to be “alone among people.” Sex entered his life suddenly, in July, 1984, when the actor Michele Placido appeared costumed as Superman on the cover of the magazine ",["em","TV Sorrisi e Canzoni."]," “I couldn’t take my eyes from the crotch,” Guadagnino says.

At fourteen, he saw John Carpenter’s sci-fi romance “",["a",{"href":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000I9YV3A?ref=sr_1_1_acs_kn_imdb_pa_dp&amp;qid=1539013819&amp;sr=1-1-acs&amp;autoplay=0"},"Starman"],",” featuring Jeff Bridges as an alien who is frequently shirtless, and felt stirred.

Through the first half of Guadagnino’s career, he included a line of thanks to Bridges, whom he has never met, in the credits of every film he made."],["p","Guadagnino arrived on the Italian mainland at twenty-one, trying to dodge the Latin requirements at the University of Palermo, where he’d been pursuing a degree in literature. The Sapienza University of Rome had no mandatory Latin exam and offered courses in cinema, so he transferred, moving often among shared apartments. His parents helped support him, not easily. (“Luca loved parties, loved to eat, loved talking on the phone,” his mother says. “One makes sacrifices.”) Despite speaking almost no English, he also enrolled in a multi-term course in American literature—Crane, Faulkner, Melville, Steinbeck.

But the film astounded him. In his thesis, Guadagnino described Demme as a quiet subversive, bringing countercultural values and political criticism onto the screen under the burnish of Hollywood fantasy. “The famous scene of Buffalo Bill looking for Clarice with night-vision glasses?” he says. “That was filmed in 1990, when we were watching America hitting Baghdad through night-vision images every day.” The lesson, for Guadagnino, was that cutting-edge filmmaking could live in the cineplex as easily as in the art house—that what a movie or a person seemed, at first, to be was just the entry gate."]],["inline-embed",{"type":"section","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22section%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cp%3EOne%20evening%2C%20as%20work%20on%20%E2%80%9CSuspiria%E2%80%9D%20wound%20down%2C%20Guadagnino%20left%20the%20editing%20room%20and%20went%20to%20a%20dinner%20at%20a%20friend%E2%80%99s%20triplex%20apartment%20on%20the%20Tiber.%20%E2%80%9CThis%20is%20a%20great%20Fascist-style%20building%2C%E2%80%9D%20he%20said%2C%20pushing%20open%20a%20heavy%20front%20door%20and%20crossing%20a%20marble%20lobby.%20Inside%20the%20apartment%2C%20he%20climbed%20a%20twisting%20staircase%20lined%20with%20plastic%20medical-anatomy%20models%3A%20body%20after%20body%2C%20all%20stripped%20bare.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EIn%20light%20of%20Guadagnino%E2%80%99s%20successes%20outside%20Italy%2C%20he%20has%20become%20known%20among%20the%20upper%20strata%20within%20it.%20The%20hosts%20that%20evening%20were%20Anna%20Federici%20and%20her%20husband%2C%20Roberto%20D%E2%80%99Agostino%2C%20who%20goes%20by%20Dago.%20Federici%20is%20an%20heiress%20to%20a%20family%20of%20Italian%20builders.%20Dago%20founded%20the%20Italian%20news%20site%20Dagospia%E2%80%94a%20witty%2C%20idiosyncratic%20blog%20of%20politics%2C%20gossip%2C%20and%20soft%20porn%20which%20Politico%20recently%20described%20as%20a%20%E2%80%9Cmust-read%20for%20the%20Italian%20%C3%A9lite.%E2%80%9D%20Upstairs%2C%20Dago%20greeted%20Guadagnino%20wearing%20blue-tinted%20sunglasses%2C%20silver%20jewelry%2C%20and%20tattoos%20from%20his%20fingers%20to%20his%20ears%3B%20his%20chin%20sported%20a%20long%20Vandyke.%20Federici%20wore%20interesting%20glasses%20and%20a%20chestnut%20bob%20framed%20by%20white.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EGuadagnino%20accepted%20a%20glass%20of%20ros%C3%A9%20and%20wandered%20around.%20The%20balcony%20glowed%20with%20blinking%20neon%20palm%20trees%2C%20an%20enormous%20Christ%20figurine%2C%20and%20illuminated%20statues%20of%20%3Ca%20href%3D%5C%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Ftag%2Fsilvio-berlusconi%5C%22%3ESilvio%20Berlusconi%3C%2Fa%3E%20and%20Chairman%20Mao.%20He%20flopped%20into%20a%20pink%20love%20seat%20of%20two%20scoop-like%20concave%20chairs%20made%20for%20Veuve%20Clicquot%2C%20reputedly%20from%20the%20casting%20of%20a%20woman%E2%80%99s%20breasts.%20They%20were%20separated%20by%20a%20champagne%20bucket%20filled%20with%20dildos.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3E%E2%80%9C%3Cem%3EYaaah%2C%20yaaaaaah.%3C%2Fem%3E%E2%80%9D%20Nelson%20Riddle%E2%80%99s%20%E2%80%9CLolita%E2%80%9D%20song%2C%20from%20Kubrick%E2%80%99s%20film%2C%20blared%20from%20a%20video-art%20piece%20nearby.%20%E2%80%9C%3Cem%3EWo-ow%2C%20wo-ow%2C%20yaaah%2C%20yaaaaaah%3C%2Fem%3E.%E2%80%9D%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EDago%20came%20over%2C%20still%20wearing%20his%20sunglasses%20and%20sucking%20on%20a%20small%20unlit%20cigar.%20He%20wanted%20to%20show%20Guadagnino%20%E2%80%9CNew%20Religion%2C%E2%80%9D%20a%20room-size%20%3Ca%20href%3D%5C%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Ftag%2FDamien%2520Hirst%5C%22%3EDamien%20Hirst%3C%2Fa%3E%20piece%20about%20faith%20and%20pharmaceuticals%20which%20he%20owned.%20(%E2%80%9CDago%20is%20a%20Catholic%2C%E2%80%9D%20Guadagnino%20explained.)%20He%20apologized%2C%20in%20passing%2C%20for%20the%20prudishness%20of%20the%20d%C3%A9cor.%20Down%20on%20the%20lower%20floor%20that%20he%E2%80%99d%20converted%20into%20offices%20for%20the%20Dagospia%20staff%2C%20he%20could%20give%20freer%20rein%20to%20his%20eclectic%20tastes%3A%20a%20wall%20of%20Sacred%20Heart%20paintings%3B%20a%20set%20of%20black-and-red%20leather%20chairs%20shaped%20like%20penises%3B%20and%2C%20on%20a%20coffee%20table%2C%20a%20set%20of%20delicate%20fine-china%20plates%20bearing%20closeup%20photographs%20of%20fellatio%20and%20of%20a%20trans%20person%20being%20penetrated%20from%20behind.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22callout%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522callout%2522%252C%2522name%2522%253A%2522inset-left%2522%252C%2522body%2522%253A%2522%253Cinline-embed%2520type%253D%255C%2522cartoon%255C%2522%2520meta%253D%255C%2522%25257B%252522type%252522%25253A%252522cartoon%252522%25252C%252522url%252522%25253A%252522%25252Fcartoon%25252F5bb7a003ca53412dbdd9337d%252522%25252C%252522width%252522%25253A%252522%252522%25252C%252522height%252522%25253A%252522%252522%25252C%252522caption%252522%25253A%252522%252522%25257D%255C%2522%2520ref%253D%255C%25225bb7a003ca53412dbdd9337d%255C%2522%253E%253C%252Finline-embed%253E%2522%252C%2522attrs%2522%253A%257B%257D%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%22%5C%22%3E%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22cartoon%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522cartoon%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%2522%252Fcartoon%252F5bb7a003ca53412dbdd9337d%2522%252C%2522width%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522height%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522caption%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%225bb7a003ca53412dbdd9337d%5C%22%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%3Cp%3EDinner%20was%20served.%20The%20guests%20filed%20downstairs%2C%20to%20the%20dining%20room%2C%20passing%20a%20nude%20frontal%20photograph%20of%20a%20slender%20man%20with%20a%2

The hosts that evening were Anna Federici and her husband, Roberto D’Agostino, who goes by Dago. Federici is an heiress to a family of Italian builders. Dago founded the Italian news site Dagospia—a witty, idiosyncratic blog of politics, gossip, and soft porn which Politico recently described as a “must-read for the Italian élite.” Upstairs, Dago greeted Guadagnino wearing blue-tinted sunglasses, silver jewelry, and tattoos from his fingers to his ears; his chin sported a long Vandyke.

Down on the lower floor that he’d converted into offices for the Dagospia staff, he could give freer rein to his eclectic tastes: a wall of Sacred Heart paintings; a set of black-and-red leather chairs shaped like penises; and, on a coffee table, a set of delicate fine-china plates bearing closeup photographs of fellatio and of a trans person being penetrated from behind."],["inline-embed",{"type":"callout","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22callout%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22inset-left%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22cartoon%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522cartoon%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%2522%252Fcartoon%252F5bb7a003ca53412dbdd9337d%2522%252C%2522width%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522height%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522caption%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%225bb7a003ca53412dbdd9337d%5C%22%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%22%2C%22attrs%22%3A%7B%7D%7D","ref":""},["inline-embed",{"type":"cartoon","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22cartoon%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22%2Fcartoon%2F5bb7a003ca53412dbdd9337d%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":"5bb7a003ca53412dbdd9337d"}]],["p","Dinner was served. The guests filed downstairs, to the dining room, passing a nude frontal photograph of a slender man with a pendulous member. “Baryshnikov’s cock. Excuse me—Nureyev’s cock!” Guadagnino said. “Dago is very proud of it.” The table was decorated with a brass hammer and sickle. Dago shut the dining-room door, which was printed with a life-size posterior photo of a naked blond woman in gold stilettos. An enormous Anselm Kiefer canvas hung opposite Guadagnino."],["p","Conversation turned to film, and to Paul Thomas Anderson’s “Phantom Thread.” That had been the age of Chanel and Dior, someone complained, and yet fashion was almost incidental to the movie.

Bertolucci made major American studio work without abandoning his own aesthetic—extraordinary! he said. (In 2013, he and Fasano made “Bertolucci on Bertolucci,” a documentary in tribute.) As servants began clearing the table for dessert, Dago presented Guadagnino with a gift in honor of his recent successes: a souvenir bottle of liqueur shaped like a penis and testicles. Guadagnino stood to make a little speech of gratitude."],["p","Later, he said that what struck him most about the evening was the food. First course: penne, precisely al dente, with a sauce of slow-cooked onions and tomatoes and a topping of bread crumbs. Second course: roasted pork with leafy greens and applesauce. It was one of the simplest and most traditional meals in Italy—comfort food from the country, perfectly done. His eye had fixated on it, through the flashing neon, the sex paraphernalia, and the multimillion-dollar art works, as the telling detail of the evening. Perceptions of Guadagnino as a director of style and surface often miss this archeological sensitivity in his attention. His interest, for instance, in the way that shaded histories linger under opulence and ease. Or in the way that a rural young woman carries powers greater than she understands. A leitmotif in his films is exhumation. “He likes to bring up the bodies,” Swinton

spent most of his early twenties as what he calls a “wanderer,” trying to catch an interesting breeze. “I was one of these boys and girls who wanted to be part of a world in which the means of production were costly, the access was difficult, and doing a movie meant making it on film,” he says. After years of scattered work—as a gallery clerk, a cook, a film reviewer—he got funding for a 16-mm. short, “Qui” (“Here”), which he made, at twenty-five, with Fasano. The film centers on a man and a woman having sex in long take, and created a small scandal when it premièred, at the Taormina Film Fest. “It was very erotic—actually, pornographic,” Guadagnino notes. “I wanted to prove that I was not a coy director.”"],["p","When Guadagnino was in his early twenties, the actress Laura Betti hired him to cook for luminaries at her home. “Laura Betti was tough, tough, tough, tough,” he recalls. “She would not have survived these days of political correctness. She used to call me ‘little whore,’ in the female gender.” In summer, Betti rented lavish villas. “One day she came to the balcony when we were by the pool. She’d been having her afternoon nap. She said, ‘Kids, listen to me! I was dreaming that my pussy, Bernarda’—the feminine of Bernardo Bertolucci, who was very close to her—‘was talking to me, and telling us what to cook for dinner tonight!’ ” Guadagnino was shy and bookish, and her parties were an education. “Not many people talked to me, and that gave me great privilege: I was able to be in the back of the room listening, understanding, seeing the contradictions,” he says. This was when he learned that people were not beacons of fixed identity but accumulations of paradox and inconsistency—and that those layers made them interesting, even worthy of love."],["p","Photographs from that era depict Guadagnino as a handsome, slender young man with a mop of curly dark hair and a confident gaze. One night, in 1994, he saw that Tilda Swinton, whom he wanted to work with, was in town for a celebration of the work of Derek Jarman at the Palazzo delle Esposizioni, and he approached her from the crowd to say that he’d written to offer her a role in a short film. Why hadn’t she replied? The film had gone unmade."],["p","“I was massively and instantly caught in the genius of his guilt trip,” Swinton says. She invited him to her hotel the next day to talk. “The bald fact is that we just liked each other from the first,” she recalls. In 1998, he moved to London for a year to make their first feature together, “The Protagonists.” The plot, about filmmakers shooting a documentary about a notorious murder, was openly postmodern; the seams and self-interrogating layers that Guadagnino would later interior-stitch into his films were worn on the outside."],["p","Guadagnino returned to Rome and did not shoot another narrative feature for six years. In 2003, a producer offered him the adaptation of a succès de scandale, “",["a",{"href":"https://www.amazon.com/Hundred-Strokes-Brush-Before-Paperback/dp/1852427884/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=1539014021&amp;sr=8-1"},"One Hundred Strokes of the Brush Before Bed"],",” by a teen-age Melissa Panarello. The book was an ambiguously fictionalized diary of Panarello’s sexual coming of age, involving S. &amp; M., orgies, and other extracurriculars. Guadagnino read slightly less than half of the text before deciding that he did not like it, but he agreed to do the adaptation. He had a plan to patch over schlocky bits by drawing on the psychoanalyst Françoise Dolto’s work on adolescence. He also had financing from Sony Pictures, which struck him as appealingly American. (His contact there, the late executive Gareth Wigan, gave him his first CD of the music of John Adams, which he has used in most films since.)"],["p","But the experience was an unhappy one. Sony, he says, set him up with a minder, who stood by the production monitor and pushed for extra footage. Guadagnino saw his heroine as a self-possessed, erotically confident young woman, yet the producers sought a moralistic ending in which she recognizes the error of her ways—“A girl who finds redemption,” he says.

winter, during Guadagnino’s stopover in Manhattan for the New York Critics Circle Awards (Chalamet was receiving the Best Actor award; Guadagnino was to introduce him), he took a green tea in the

Guadagnino gazed wistfully out the window for a few seconds. “A terrible waste, because the actors are amazing,” he said. Then he shrugged. In his younger years, he would have hustled to accommodate a rush request—to “be the good-will guy”—but he now considered this folly.

He ordered a dry macchiato and a Gibson."],["p","“I think my project is gone. My Jake movie is bye-bye,” Guadagnino said."],["p","“Really?” Hammer said."],["p","Guadagnino explained. But it was O.K., he said. There were other movies to be made. For instance, he wanted to film a sequel to “Call Me by Your Name.” He wanted Johnson to play the wife of Hammer’s character. “She has to be a New England kind of hoochie woman,” he said, riffing merrily. “You have, maybe, five children.”"],["p","“Oh, great,” Hammer said."],["p","“The only problem is the title,” Guadagnino reflected. “It cannot be ‘Call Me by Your Name Two.’ ”"],["p","Like not a few directors, Guadagnino loathes the experience of shooting movies. The frisson of conception? That is heaven. Spending hours with actors or in an editing room? Bliss. But in between is the nightmare of getting the images onto film. If you are the director on set, people swarm you all day, asking for decisions. Things go wrong; there’s money hanging on each second. Then you call “Cut” and actors look at you, probably judging you, waiting to hear what comes next. Early on, Guadagnino was afraid to direct scenes where a lot of characters are doing things together in one room, because the eyes of all those actors awaiting blocking terrified him. Even in making “Melissa P.,” he had tried to storyboard the scenes in advance and keep them uncrowded. But the process had left him feeling, at nearly forty, chagrined about production, defensive and frail."],["p","Around that time, Guadagnino watched a documentary about Ingmar Bergman making “",["a",{"href":"https://www.amazon.com/Alexander-Theatrical-Version-English-Subtitled/dp/B00J4UL132/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1539014070&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=Fanny+and+Alexander"},"Fanny and Alexander"],",” and found it a revelation. “You see that Bergman is constantly lost, and has no shame about that,” Guadagnino recalls. “He’s a living legend, and yet he needs to find his way—that tentativeness is ",["em","how"]," he got these astonishing sequences.” Guadagnino decided that he would allow himself to be vulnerable and open, like Bergman. He would have not just one crowded scene but many such scenes. He would dispense with storyboards and shot lists and would be free, even under scrutiny, to feel decisions out."],["p","The movie that he made was “I Am Love.” Not since Michael Mann, perhaps, has a cinematic voice come into focus so startlingly in the middle of a director’s career. “I Am Love” follows three generations of a large, wealthy Milanese family as they variously succumb to structural and physical needs. The middle-aged mother (Swinton) falls in love with a young chef (Edoardo Gabbriellini). Her daughter (Alba Rohrwacher), an artist, has a secret lesbian affair; her son’s fiancée (Diane Fleri) conceals her pregnancy. Ingeniously, the film revelled in bourgeois beauty and comfort—genuinely, fully, without ideological disdain—as a groundwork for critique. It insisted that there is real sensual pleasure, even human tenderness, to be found in a beautiful dress or a perfect meal. (“He and I often talked of forging what I call a ‘sense-ationalist’ cinema, a cinema you can taste and smell and feel in a bath of environmental experience,” Swinton says.) Yet it also insisted on the sensual needs of the body, which will tear the world of those comforting pleasures apart."],["p","Guadagnino’s cinematic style made this tension clear through extreme, contrasting points of view: restless closeups mixed with stately wide shots, refined fabrics leading to the thud of a body. In a notable sequence, the camera performs a huge S-turn, swirling around a plate of pastries, tracking Swinton down a staircase (staircases are the film’s transitional spaces) and framing a doorway where she meets her lover—the camera in sensual pursuit. Elsewhere, she is a speck in an exquisitely deep shot. The effect is to portray a consciousness reacting to itself: rushing forward on kinetics and desire, stepping back in prudence to order, preserve, and frame. One of Guadagnino’s favorite books is Judith Butler’s “",["a",{"href":"https://www.amazon.com/Bodies-That-Matter-Discursive-Limits/dp/041561015X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1539014094&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=bodies+that+matter"},"Bodies That Matter"],",” and the title serves as a key to his work. His movies are haunted by betrayals of and by the body, and then by their effect on the elaborating and evasive efforts of the mind."],["p","This brand of realism—Guadagnino’s use of the camera as a kind of nervous system, susceptible to human obsessions, vanities, and contradictions—illuminates, among other things, his mature approach to the erotic. “I’m a real voyeur, and all the directors I love are real voyeurs, too,” he says. “Think of Catherine Breillat or Ida Lupino—how strongly her gaze ",["em","communicates"]," that sense of possession.” Although there’s sex in “I Am Love,” the libidinous moment that viewers usually recall best occurs between Swinton’s character and a plate of prawns. The comparable scene in “Suspiria,” a film that’s at once sexless and lambently erogenous, comes when Madame Blanc brings Susie to a climax not of pleasure but of strength: she jumps higher than she has ever jumped before. “It’s a film about women trying to build up private sources of power because they aren’t allowed to have them publicly,” Kajganich, the screenwriter, says."],["p","Guadagnino’s determination to alloy sex with self-discovery imbues his mature work. In “Call Me by Your Name,” the camera looks demurely out the window at a tree as the male lovers consummate their relationship, a move that earned Guadagnino accusations of homoerotic shyness. And yet that consummation suffuses much of the film—from the villa’s shutters, beating in the wind like a headboard, to the roughness and care with which Oliver handles his breakfast eggs. Swinton points to a transitive quality of identity in Guadagnino’s work, as the physical world acquires human affects and as characters swap roles, literally or figuratively assuming each other’s names. After his last film came out, Guadagnino was surprised that no one saw what he found obvious about Michael Stuhlbarg’s welcoming, quietly suffering character. “That father is a mother,” he

At one point, he scored an interview with a porn star who was a fixture on talk shows. “The editor said to me, in the typical Communist parochial way, ‘We are against pornography. We can’t publish it,’ ” Guadagnino recalls. He protested, and the paper seemed to accede, but, when the issue came out, he found that his interview had been prefaced by an editor’s note disavowing the text. Guadagnino resigned his Party membership that day, and never participated publicly in another movement. “I learned my lesson,” he says. There were better paths to politics. He set “A Bigger Splash” on Pantelleria—a windswept Italian island between Sicily and francophone North Africa and a funnel point for refugees. “Suspiria” unfolds against the events of the German autumn: a generational reckoning for a nation’s buried rooms. (The fictional Markos Dance Company is known for a thirty-year-old anguished, expurgatory dance titled “",["em","Volk"],".”) “Everything is political, whether you are aware or unaware,” Guadagnino says."],["p","A Hollywood hairdresser finished his coif.

These days, to keep busy, he accepts a stream of for-hire projects. Swinton calls him “a natural yes-sayer,” always “setting things in motion, then repairing to a supine position of almost adolescent languor.” He has made films for Ferragamo, and shot fashion spreads. He has designed the interior for an Aesop shop, in Rome. In the past couple of years, he has set up a side business that he says he enjoys as much as making movies. This is the business of interior design."],["p","One morning, Guadagnino was driven from Milan to Lenno, on the western shore of Lake Como, while reading the newspaper from his knees, which bobbed before him at eye level. He was designing a villa and a guesthouse on the lake which belonged to his long-standing friend Federico Marchetti, the C.E.O. of Yoox Net-a-Porter Group, the fashion e-commerce site. “Being very bombastic, I said, ‘O.K.!’ ” Guadagnino recalls. “I did not say, ‘I have never done this before and don’t know how to do it.’ ”"],["p","He worked on the house while making “Suspiria,” shooting from Monday to Friday and designing at the property on weekends, to relax.

The morning was crisp and windless, and its light was Como light—pale, harsh, and thinned by early fog. He had designed the main house around a wall-panelling motif made from pyramidal strips of wood; the idea came to him at the Moderna Museet, in Stockholm. As Guadagnino walked around, he became visibly excited, snatching drop cloths from mirrors and assessing progress. The carpet on the staircase was bespoke, he proclaimed, and it changed color in two directions. The basement pool was deep-green marble, decked with hinoki wood shipped from Japan. “This craftsmanship is fantastic—and ",["em","life-affirming!"]," ” he cried. Then he checked in on the rooms he’d designed for Marchetti’s daughter."],["inline-embed",{"type":"callout","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22callout%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22inset-left%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22cartoon%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522cartoon%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%2522%252Fcartoon%252F5bb8097a742f932cbcb7a3f1%2522%252C%2522width%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522height%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522caption%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%225bb8097a742f932cbcb7a3f1%5C%22%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%22%2C%22attrs%22%3A%7B%7D%7D","ref":""},["inline-embed",{"type":"cartoon","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22cartoon%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22%2Fcartoon%2F5bb8097a742f932cbcb7a3f1%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":"5bb8097a742f932cbcb7a3f1"}]],["p","Having no children of his own, Guadagnino has fallen into a tutelary role toward the young people in his life.

recently travelled to New York, to shoot a “Suspiria”-inspired fashion spread for ",["em","W"],". The photographs were to be of Dakota Johnson, and the setting was the Samuel Borchardt House, an opulent Gilded Age mansion on West Eighty-sixth Street. “A nightmare in the making,” Guadagnino murmured.

He snapped a few shots. “Maybe too much.” He turned to an assistant and asked for water. “Room-temperature bottle,” he advised."],["p","The usual stream of Guadagnino’s friends came around, including the screenwriter Richard LaGravenese. Guadagnino calls LaGravenese “this guy that I ",["em","totally"]," and ",["em","completely"]," love!,” and LaGravenese calls Guadagnino “the first director who has allowed me to write fully emotional moments.” A producer of “Call Me by Your Name” had acquired the theatrical rights to “Blood on the Tracks,” the album by Bob Dylan, and had asked Guadagnino to make it into a movie. Sure, Guadagnino had said, but only if LaGravenese, whom he had never met, wrote it. (LaGravenese had previously written “The Fisher King,” “The Bridges of Madison County,” and, most exciting to Guadagnino, Demme’s adaptation of “Beloved.”) Somehow, the moon shot landed. LaGravenese cleared his schedule and, between April and July, hunkered down to produce a hundred-and-eighty-eight-page screenplay following characters through a multiyear story, set in the seventies, that he and Guadagnino had invented, drawing on the album’s central themes. “When they’re repressing, we dramatize the repression, and what that does to them,” LaGravenese says. “And we dramatize what happens when you let your passions take over too much.”"],["p","The sum of repression and expression can be coyness. During the final minutes of “Suspiria,” a piece of printed matter flits across the screen bearing the phrase “",["em","Ahnenpaß"],"”—“Aryan Papers.” It is a Nabokovian gag from the director, and a talisman as well. In 1993, Warner Bros. approved a ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/Stanley%20Kubrick"},"Stanley Kubrick"]," movie, titled “The Aryan Papers,” based on Louis Begley’s novel “",["a",{"href":"https://www.amazon.com/Wartime-Lies-Novel-Louis-Begley/dp/0449001172/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1539014182&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Wartime+Lies"},"Wartime Lies"],".” Kubrick developed a treatment, but froze the project when “Schindler’s List” was released. Since that moment, twenty-five years ago, Guadagnino has desperately wanted to make “The Aryan Papers.” He has been lobbying the Kubrick estate, and has asked Kajganich to write the screenplay."],["p","There’s something eerie in the fact that Guadagnino fell in love with the project when he was still a young man invested in radical cinema and pornographic frankness. The novel, drawn from Begley’s experiences, is narrated by a bourgeois Polish Jew who, in boyhood, received papers that allowed him to pose as an Aryan Catholic. The character carries this lie forward, weaving a story about the human stakes of concealment. It is almost as if Guadagnino had an early intimation of precisely the filmmaker he’d become—as if, while still preparing “Qui,” he saw himself emerging from work on “Suspiria,” a movie about hidden lineage and wartime guilt, in need of something new."],["p","Upstairs at the mansion, Guadagnino put the camera down for a moment to show Johnson how to pose. She snatched it up and turned it on him, snapping frames and coming closer. “Don’t ",["em","move"],",” she said. “Don’t move.”"],["p","Guadagnino glanced at the photo monitor. “Oh, my God,” he said in horror."],["p","Johnson laughed. Guadagnino recoiled. “Erase that,” he pleaded. But Johnson kept giggling, clutching the camera in her hands. If she’d opened the shutter then, she would have caught him in a truly candid pose: eyes wide open, hands spread, covering his face in a mask. ♦"]]],"canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"sections":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"},"slug":"magazine","children":[{"id":"590a18798b51cf59fc42477f","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"590a18798b51cf59fc42477f","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Profiles","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"profiles"},{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"},{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"}],"name":"Profiles","parent":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"},"slug":"profiles"}]}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"magazine","contentTags":[],"contentType":"article","contributors":[{"name":"Nathan Heller","type":"author","title":"Nathan Heller began contributing to \u003cem&gt;The New Yorker\u003c/em&gt; in 2011, and joined the magazine as a staff writer in 2013.","email":"","bio":["div",["p","Nathan Heller began contributing to ",["em","The New Yorker"]," in 2011, and joined the magazine as a staff writer in 2013.

The answer lies in the name of the game: ",["em","sortes vergilianae"],". The Latin noun ",["em","sortes"]," means lots—as in “drawing lots,” a reference to the game’s element of chance. The adjective ",["em","vergilianae"],", which means “having to do with Vergilius,” identifies the book: the works of the Roman poet Publius Vergilius Maro, whom we know as ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/virgil"},"Virgil"],"."],["p","For a long stretch of Western history, few people would have found it odd to ascribe prophetic power to this collection of Latin verse. Its author, after all, was the greatest and the most influential of all Roman poets. A friend and confidant of Augustus, Rome’s first emperor, Virgil was already considered a classic in his own lifetime: revered, quoted, imitated, and occasionally parodied by other writers, taught in schools, and devoured by the general public. Later generations of Romans considered his works a font of human knowledge, from rhetoric to ethics to agriculture; by the Middle Ages, the poet had come to be regarded as a wizard whose powers included the ability to control Vesuvius’s eruptions and to cure blindness in sheep."],["p","However fantastical the proportions to which this reverence grew, it was grounded in a very real achievement represented by one poem in particular: the Aeneid, a heroic epic in twelve chapters (or “books”) about the mythic founding of Rome, which some ancient sources say Augustus commissioned and which was, arguably, the single most influential literary work of European civilization for the better part of two millennia."],["p","Virgil had published other, shorter works before the Aeneid, but it’s no accident that the epic was a magnet for the fingers of the great and powerful who played the ",["em","sortes"]," ",["em","vergilianae"],". Its central themes are leadership, empire, history, and war. In it, an upstanding Trojan prince named Aeneas, son of Venus, the goddess of love, flees Troy after its destruction by the Greeks, and, along with his father, his son, and a band of fellow-survivors, sets out to establish a new realm across the sea, in Italy, the homeland that’s been promised to him by divine prophecy. Into that traditional story Virgil cannily inserted a number of showstopping glimpses into Rome’s future military and political triumphs, complete with cameo appearances by Augustus himself—the implication being that the real-life empire arose from a god-kissed mythic past. The Emperor and his people alike were hooked: within a century of its author’s death, in 19 B.C., citizens of Pompeii were scrawling lines from the epic on the walls of shops and houses."],["p","People haven’t stopped quoting it since. From the moment it appeared, the Aeneid was the paradigmatic classic in Western art and education; as one scholar has put it, Virgil “occupied the central place in the literary canon for the whole of Europe for longer than any other writer.” (After the Western Roman Empire fell, in the late fifth century A.D., knowledge of Greek—and, hence, intimacy with ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/homer"},"Homer"],"’s epics—virtually disappeared from Western Europe for a thousand years.) Virgil’s poetry has been indispensable to everyone from his irreverent younger contemporary Ovid, whose parodies of the older poet’s gravitas can’t disguise a genuine admiration, to St. Augustine, who, in his “Confessions,” recalls weeping over the Aeneid, his favorite book before he discovered the Bible; from Dante, who chooses Virgil, ",["em","l’altissimo poeta"],", “the highest poet,” as his guide through Hell and Purgatory in the Divine Comedy, to T. S. Eliot, who returned repeatedly to Virgil in his critical essays and pronounced the Aeneid “the classic of all Europe.”"],["inline-embed",{"type":"callout","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22callout%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22inset-left%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22cartoon%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522cartoon%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%2522%252Fcartoon%252F5bb6632cb3243c2da4b66b50%2522%252C%2522width%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522height%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522caption%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%225bb6632cb3243c2da4b66b50%5C%22%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%22%2C%22attrs%22%3A%7B%7D%7D","ref":""},["inline-embed",{"type":"cartoon","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22cartoon%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22%2Fcartoon%2F5bb6632cb3243c2da4b66b50%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":"5bb6632cb3243c2da4b66b50"}]],["p","And not only Europe. Alexander Hamilton, Thomas Jefferson, and Benjamin Franklin liked to quote Virgil in their speeches and letters. The poet’s idealized vision of honest farmers and shepherds working in rural simplicity was influential, some scholars believe, in shaping the Founders’ vision of the new republic as one in which an agricultural majority should hold power. Throughout the nineteenth century, Virgil was a central fixture of American grammar-school education; the ability to translate passages on sight was a standard entrance requirement at many colleges and universities. John Adams boasted that his son John Quincy had translated the entire Aeneid. Ellen Emerson wrote her father, Ralph Waldo, to say that she was covering a hundred and twenty lines a day; Helen Keller read it in Braille. Today, traces of the epic’s cultural authority linger on: a quotation from it greets visitors to the Memorial Hall of the 9/11 Museum, in New York City. Since the turn of the current century, there have been at least five major translations into English alone, most recently by the American poet David Ferry (Chicago), in the ",["a",{"href":"https://www.amazon.com/Aeneid-Virgil/dp/022645018X"},"final installment"]," of his translation of Virgil’s complete works."],["p","Still, the Aeneid—notoriously—can be hard to love. In part, this has to do with its aesthetics. In place of the raw archaic potency of Homer’s epics, which seems to dissolve the millennia between his heroes and us, Virgil’s densely allusive poem offers an elaborately self-conscious “literary” suavity. (The critic and Columbia professor Mark Van Doren remarked that “Homer is a world; Virgil, a style.”) Then, there’s Aeneas himself—“in some ways,” as even the Great Courses Web site felt compelled to acknowledge, “the dullest character in epic literature.” In the Aeneid’s opening lines, Virgil announces that the hero is famed above all for his ",["em","pietas"],", his “sense of duty”: hardly the sexiest attribute for a protagonist. If Aeneas was meant to be a model proto-Roman, he has long struck many readers as a cold fish; he and his comrades, the philosopher György Lukács once observed, live “the cool and limited existence of shadows.” Particularly in comparison with his Homeric predecessors, Aeneas comes up short, lacking the cruel glamour of Achilles, or Odysseus’s beguiling smarts."],["p","But the biggest problem by far for modern audiences is the poem’s subject matter. Today, the themes that made the epic required reading for generations of emperors and generals, and for the clerics and teachers who groomed them—the inevitability of imperial dominance, the responsibilities of authoritarian rule, the importance of duty and self-abnegation in the service of the state—are proving to be an embarrassment. If readers of an earlier era saw the Aeneid as an inspiring advertisement for the onward march of Rome’s many descendants, from the Holy Roman Empire to the British one, scholars now see in it a tale of nationalistic arrogance whose plot is an all too familiar handbook for repressive violence: once Aeneas and his fellow-Trojans arrive on the coast of Italy, they find that they must fight a series of wars with an indigenous population that, eventually, they brutally subjugate."],["p","The result is that readers today can have a very strange relationship to this classic: it’s a work we feel we should embrace but often keep at arm’s length. Take that quote in the 9/11 Museum: “No day shall erase you from the memory of time.” Whoever came up with the idea of using it was clearly ignorant of the context: these high-minded words are addressed to a pair of nighttime marauders whose bloody ambush of a group of unsuspecting targets suggests that they have far more in common with the 9/11 terrorists than with their victims. A century ago, many a college undergrad could have caught the gaffe; today, it was enough to have an impressive-sounding quote from an acknowledged classic."],["p","Another way of saying all this is that, while our forebears looked confidently to the text of the Aeneid for answers, today it raises troubling questions. Who exactly is Aeneas, and why should we admire him? What is the epic’s political stance? Can we ignore the parts we dislike and cherish the rest? Should great poetry serve an authoritarian regime—and just whose side was Virgil on? Two thousand years after its appearance, we still can’t decide if his masterpiece is a regressive celebration of power as a means of political domination or a craftily coded critique of imperial ideology—a work that still has something useful to tell us."]],["inline-embed",{"type":"section","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22section%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cp%3ELittle%20in%20Virgil%E2%80%99s%20background%20destined%20him%20to%20be%20the%20great%20poet%20of%20empire.%20He%20was%20born%20on%20October%2015%2C%2070%20B.C.%2C%20in%20a%20village%20outside%20Mantua%3B%20his%20father%2C%20perhaps%20a%20well-off%20farmer%2C%20had%20the%20means%20to%20provide%20him%20with%20a%20good%20education%2C%20first%20in%20Cremona%20and%20Milan%20and%20then%20in%20Rome.%20The%20inhabitants%20of%20his%20native%20northern%20region%20had%20only%20recently%20been%20granted%20Roman%20citizenship%20through%20a%20decree%20by%20%3Ca%20href%3D%5C%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Ftag%2Fjulius-caesar%5C%22%3EJulius%20Caesar%3C%2Fa%3E%2C%20issued%20when%20the%20poet%20was%20a%20young%20man.%20Hence%2C%20even%20after%20his%20first%20major%20work%2C%20a%20collection%20of%20pastoral%20poems%20called%20the%20Eclogues%2C%20gained%20him%20an%20entr%C3%A9e%20into%20Roman%20literary%20circles%2C%20Virgil%20must%20have%20seemed%E2%80%94and%20perhaps%20felt%E2%80%94something%20of%20an%20outsider%3A%20a%20reserved%20country%20fellow%20with%20(as%20his%20friend%20the%20poet%20Horace%20teased%20him)%20a%20hick%E2%80%99s%20haircut%2C%20who%20spoke%20so%20haltingly%20that%20he%20could%20seem%20downright%20uneducated.%20His%20retiring%20nature%2C%20which%20earned%20him%20the%20nickname%20%3Cem%3Eparthenias%3C%2Fem%3E%20(%E2%80%9Clittle%20virgin%E2%80%9D)%2C%20may%20have%20been%20the%20reason%20he%20decided%20not%20to%20remain%20in%20Rome%20to%20complete%20his%20education.%20Instead%2C%20he%20settled%20in%20Naples%2C%20a%20city%20with%20deep%20ties%20to%20the%20culture%20of%20the%20Greeks%2C%20which%20he%20and%20his%20literary%20contemporaries%20revered.%20In%20the%20final%20lines%20of%20the%20Georgics%2C%20a%20long%20didactic%20poem%20about%20farming%20which%20he%20finished%20when%20he%20was%20around%20forty%2C%20the%20poet%20looked%20back%20yearningly%20to%20the%20untroubled%20leisure%20he%20had%20enjoyed%20during%20that%20period%3A%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cblockquote%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EAnd%20I%2C%20the%20poet%20Virgil%2C%20nurtured%20by%20sweet%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EParth%C3%A9nop%C3%A9%20%5BNaples%5D%2C%20was%20flourishing%20in%20the%20pleasures%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EOf%20idle%20studies%2C%20I%2C%20who%20bold%20in%20youth%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EPlayed%20games%20with%20shepherds%E2%80%99%20songs.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3C%2Fblockquote%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EI%E2%80%99m%20quoting%20David%20Ferry%E2%80%99s%20translation%20of%20the%20poem.%20But%20the%20word%20that%20Ferry%20translates%20as%20%E2%80%9Cidle%E2%80%9D%20is%20somewhat%20stronger%20in%20the%20original%3A%20Virgil%20says%20that%20his%20leisure%20time%20was%20%3Cem%3Eignobilis%3C%2Fem%3E%2C%20%E2%80%9Cignoble%2C%E2%80%9D%20a%20choice%20that%20suggests%20some%20guilt%20about%20that%20easygoing%20Neapolitan%20idyll.%20And%20with%20good%20reason%3A%20however%20%E2%80%9Csweet%E2%80%9D%20those%20times%20were%20for%20Virgil%2C%20for%20Rome%20they%20were%20anything%20but.%20The%20poet%E2%80%99s%20lifetime%20spanned%20the%20harrowing%20disintegration%20of%20the%20Roman%20Republic%20and%20the%20fraught%20birth%20of%20the%20Empire%E2%80%94by%20any%20measure%2C%20one%20of%20the%20most%20traumatic%20centuries%20in%20European%20history.%20Virgil%20was%20a%20schoolchild%20when%20the%20orator%20and%20statesman%20Cicero%20foiled%20a%20plot%20by%20the%20corrupt%20aristocrat%20Catiline%20to%20overthrow%20the%20Republic%3B%20by%20the%20time%20the%20poet%20was%20twenty%2C%20Julius%20Caesar%2C%20defying%20the%20Senate%E2%80%99s%20orders%2C%20had%20crossed%20the%20Rubicon%20with%20his%20army%20and%20set%20in%20motion%20yet%20another%20civil%20war.%20It%20was%20another%20two%20decades%20before%20Caesar%E2%80%99s%20great-nephew%20and%20heir%2C%20Octavian%2C%20defeated%20the%20last%20of%20his%20rivals%2C%20the%20renegade%20general%20Antony%20and%20his%20Egyptian%20consort%2C%20Cleopatra%2C%20at%20the%20Battle%20of%20Actium%2C%20and%20established%20the%20so-called%20Principate%E2%80%94the%20rule%20of%20the%20%3Cem%3Eprinceps%3C%2Fem%3E%20(%E2%80%9Cfirst%20citizen%E2%80%9D)%2C%20an%20emperor%20in%20everything%20but%20name.%20Soon%20afterward%2C%20he%20took%20the%20quasi-religious%20honorific%20%E2%80%9CAugustus.%E2%80%9D%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EThe%20new%20ruler%20was%20a%20man%20of%20refined%20literary%20tastes%3B%20Virgil%20and%20his%20patron%2C%20Maecenas%2C%20the%20regime%E2%80%99s%20unofficial%20minister%20of%20culture%2C%20are%20said%20to%20have%20taken%20turns%20reading%20the%20Georgics%20aloud%20to%20the%20Emperor%20after%20his%20victory%20at%20Actium.%20Augustus%20no%20doubt%20liked%20what%20he%20heard.%20In%20one%20passage%2C%20the%20poet%20expresses%20a%20fervent%20hope%20that%20Rome%E2%80%99s%20young%20new%20leader%20will%20be%20able%20to%20spare%20Italy%20the%20wars%20that%20have%20wreaked%20havoc%20on%20the%20lives%20of%20the%20farmers%20whose%20labor%20is%20the%20subject%20of%20the%20poem%3B%20in%20anoth

in Virgil’s background destined him to be the great poet of empire. He was born on October 15, 70 B.C., in a village outside Mantua; his father, perhaps a well-off farmer, had the means to provide him with a good education, first in Cremona and Milan and then in Rome. The inhabitants of his native northern region had only recently been granted Roman citizenship through a decree by ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/julius-caesar"},"Julius Caesar"],", issued when the poet was a young man. Hence, even after his first major work, a collection of pastoral poems called the Eclogues, gained him an entrée into Roman literary circles, Virgil must have seemed—and perhaps felt—something of an outsider: a reserved country fellow with (as his friend the poet Horace teased him) a hick’s haircut, who spoke so haltingly that he could seem downright uneducated. His retiring nature, which earned him the nickname ",["em","parthenias"]," (“little virgin”), may have been the reason he decided not to remain in Rome to complete his education. Instead, he settled in Naples, a city with deep ties to the culture of the Greeks, which he and his literary contemporaries revered. In the final lines of the Georgics, a long didactic poem about farming which he finished when he was around forty, the poet looked back yearningly to the untroubled leisure he had enjoyed during that period:"],["blockquote",["p","And I, the poet Virgil, nurtured by sweet"],["p","Parthénopé [Naples], was flourishing in the pleasures"],["p","Of idle studies, I, who bold in youth"],["p","Played games with shepherds’ songs."]],["p","I’m quoting David Ferry’s translation of the poem. But the word that Ferry translates as “idle” is somewhat stronger in the original: Virgil says that his leisure time was ",["em","ignobilis"],", “ignoble,” a choice that suggests some guilt about that easygoing Neapolitan idyll. And with good reason: however “sweet” those times were for Virgil, for Rome they were anything but. The poet’s lifetime spanned the harrowing disintegration of the Roman Republic and the fraught birth of the Empire—by any measure, one of the most traumatic centuries in European history. Virgil was a schoolchild when the orator and statesman Cicero foiled a plot by the corrupt aristocrat Catiline to overthrow the Republic; by the time the poet was twenty, Julius Caesar, defying the Senate’s orders, had crossed the Rubicon with his army and set in motion yet another civil war. It was another two decades before Caesar’s great-nephew and heir, Octavian, defeated the last of his rivals, the renegade general Antony and his Egyptian consort, Cleopatra, at the Battle of Actium, and established the so-called Principate—the rule of the ",["em","princeps"]," (“first citizen”), an emperor in everything but name. Soon afterward, he took the quasi-religious honorific “Augustus.”"],["p","The new ruler was a man of refined literary tastes; Virgil and his patron, Maecenas, the regime’s unofficial minister of culture, are said to have taken turns reading the Georgics aloud to the Emperor after his victory at Actium. Augustus no doubt liked what he heard. In one passage, the poet expresses a fervent hope that Rome’s young new leader will be able to spare Italy the wars that have wreaked havoc on the lives of the farmers whose labor is the subject of the poem; in another, he envisages the erection of a grand temple honoring the ruler."],["p","Because we like to imagine poets as being free in their political conscience, such fawning seems distasteful. (Robert Graves, the author of “I, Claudius,” complained that “few poets have brought such discredit as Virgil on their sacred calling.”) But Virgil cannot have been alone among intelligent Romans in welcoming Augustus’s regime as, at the very least, a stable alternative to the decades of internecine horrors that had preceded it. If Augustus did in fact suggest the idea for a national epic, it must have been while Virgil was still working on the Georgics, which includes a trailer for his next project: “And soon I’ll gird myself to tell the tales / Of Caesar’s brilliant battles, and carry his name / In story across . . . many future years.” He began work on the Aeneid around 29 B.C. and was in the final stages of writing when, ten years later, he died suddenly while returning home from a trip to Greece. He was buried in his beloved Naples."],["p","The epic’s state of completion continues to be a subject of debate. There’s little doubt that a number of lines are metrically incomplete, a fact that dovetails with what we know about the poet’s working method: he liked to joke that, in order to preserve his momentum while writing, he’d put in temporary lines to serve as “struts” until the “finished columns” were ready. According to one anecdote, the dying Virgil begged his literary executors to burn the manuscript of the epic, but Augustus intervened, and, after some light editing, the finished work finally appeared. In the epitaph he composed for himself, Virgil refers with disarming modesty to his achievement: “Mantua gave me birth, Calabria took me, now Naples / holds me fast. I sang of pastures, farms, leaders.”"]],["inline-embed",{"type":"section","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22section%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cp%3EVirgil%20was%20keenly%20aware%20that%2C%20in%20composing%20an%20epic%20that%20begins%20at%20Troy%2C%20describes%20the%20wanderings%20of%20a%20great%20hero%2C%20and%20features%20book%20after%20book%20of%20gory%20battles%2C%20he%20was%20working%20in%20the%20long%20shadow%20of%20Homer.%20But%2C%20instead%20of%20being%20crushed%20by%20what%20Harold%20Bloom%20called%20%E2%80%9Cthe%20anxiety%20of%20influence%2C%E2%80%9D%20he%20found%20a%20way%20to%20acknowledge%20his%20Greek%20models%20while%20adapting%20them%20to%20Roman%20themes.%20Excerpts%20of%20the%20work%20in%20progress%20were%20already%20impressing%20fellow-writers%20by%20the%20mid-twenties%20B.C.%2C%20when%20the%20love%20poet%20Propertius%20wrote%20that%20%E2%80%9Csomething%20greater%20than%20the%20Iliad%20is%20being%20born.%E2%80%9D%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EThe%20very%20structure%20of%20the%20Aeneid%20is%20a%20wink%20at%20Homer.%20The%20epic%20is%20split%20between%20an%20%E2%80%9COdyssean%E2%80%9D%20first%20half%20(Books%20I%20through%20VI%20recount%20Aeneas%E2%80%99s%20wanderings%20as%20he%20makes%20his%20way%20from%20Troy%20to%20Italy)%20and%20an%20%E2%80%9CIliadic%E2%80%9D%20second%20half%20(Books%20VII%20through%20XII%20focus%20on%20the%20wars%20that%20the%20hero%20and%20his%20allies%20wage%20in%20order%20to%20take%20possession%20of%20their%20new%20homeland).%20Virgil%20signals%20this%20appropriation%20of%20the%20two%20Greek%20classics%20in%20his%20work%E2%80%99s%20famous%20opening%20line%2C%20%E2%80%9CArms%20and%20a%20man%20I%20sing%E2%80%9D%3A%20the%20Iliad%20is%20the%20great%20epic%20of%20war%20(%E2%80%9Carms%E2%80%9D)%2C%20while%20the%20Odyssey%20begins%20by%20announcing%20that%20its%20subject%20is%20%E2%80%9Ca%20man%E2%80%9D%E2%80%94Odysseus.%20Virtually%20every%20one%20of%20the%20Aeneid%E2%80%99s%20nine%20thousand%20eight%20hundred%20and%20ninety-six%20lines%20is%20embedded%2C%20like%20that%20first%20one%2C%20in%20an%20intricate%20web%20of%20literary%20references%2C%20not%20only%20to%20earlier%20Greek%20and%20Roman%20literature%20but%20to%20a%20wide%20range%20of%20religious%2C%20historical%2C%20and%20mythological%20arcana.%20This%20allusive%20complexity%20would%20have%20flattered%20the%20sophistication%20of%20the%20original%20audience%2C%20but%20today%20it%20can%20leave%20everyone%20except%20specialists%20flipping%20to%20the%20endnotes.%20In%20this%20way%2C%20Virgil%E2%80%99s%20Homeric%20riff%20prefigures%20James%20Joyce%E2%80%99s%2C%20twenty%20centuries%20later%3A%20whatever%20the%20great%20passages%20of%20intense%20humanity%2C%20there%20are%20parts%20that%20feel%20like%20a%20treasure%20hunt%20designed%20for%20graduate%20students%20of%20the%20future.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EIt%20is%2C%20indeed%2C%20hardly%20surprising%20that%20readers%20through%20the%20centuries%20have%20found%20the%20Aeneid%E2%80%99s%20first%20half%20more%20engaging.%20As%20in%20the%20%3Ca%20href%3D%5C%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Ftag%2Fthe-odyssey%5C%22%3EOdyssey%3C%2Fa%3E%2C%20there%20are%20shipwrecks%20caused%20by%20angry%20deities%20(Juno%2C%20the%20queen%20of%20the%20gods%2C%20tries%20to%20foil%20Aeneas%20at%20every%20turn)%20and%20succor%20from%20helpful%20ones%20(Venus%20intervenes%20every%20now%20and%20then%20to%20help%20her%20son).%20There%20are%20councils%20of%20the%20gods%20at%20which%20the%20destinies%20of%20mortals%20are%20sorted%20out%3B%20at%20one%20point%2C%20Jupiter%2C%20the%20king%20of%20the%20pantheon%2C%20assures%20the%20anxious%20Venus%20(and%2C%20by%20implication%2C%20the%20Roman%20reader)%20that%20the%20nation%20her%20son%20is%20about%20to%20found%20will%20enjoy%20%3Cem%3Eimperium%20sine%20fine%3C%2Fem%3E%2C%20%E2%80%9Crule%20without%20end.%E2%80%9D%20As%20for%20the%20mortals%2C%20there%20are%20melancholy%20reunions%20with%20old%20friends%20and%20family%20and%20hair-raising%20encounters%20with%20legendary%20monsters.%20Virgil%20has%20a%20lot%20of%20fun%20retooling%20episodes%20from%20the%20Odyssey%3A%20his%20hero%20has%20close%20calls%20with%20Scylla%20and%20Charybdis%2C%20lands%20on%20the%20Cyclops%E2%80%99%20island%20just%20after%20Odysseus%20has%20left%2C%20and%E2%80%94in%20an%20amusing%20moment%20that%20does%20an%20end%20run%20around%20Homer%E2%80%94decides%20to%20sail%20right%20past%20Circe%E2%80%99s%20abode.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EAnd%2C%20like%20Odysseus%2C%20Aeneas%20is%20dangerously%20distracted%20from%20his%20mission%20by%20a%20beautiful%20woman%3A%20Dido%2C%20the%20queen%20of%20the%20North%20African%20city%20of%20Carthage%2C%20where%20the%20hero%20has%20been%20welcomed%20hospitably%20after%20he%20is%20shipwrecked.%20Venus%2C%20eager%20for%20her%20son%20to%20find%20a%20safe%20haven%20there%2C%20sends%20Cupid%20to%20make%20Dido%20fall%20in%20love%20with%20Aeneas%20in%20Book%20I%2C%20and%20throughout%20Books%20II%20and%20III%20the%20queen%20grows%20ever%20more%20besotted%20with%20her%20guest%2C%20who%20holds%20her%20court%20spellbound%20with%

was keenly aware that, in composing an epic that begins at Troy, describes the wanderings of a great hero, and features book after book of gory battles, he was working in the long shadow of Homer. But, instead of being crushed by what Harold Bloom called “the anxiety of influence,” he found a way to acknowledge his Greek models while adapting them to Roman themes. Excerpts of the work in progress were already impressing fellow-writers by the mid-twenties B.C., when the love poet Propertius wrote that “something greater than the Iliad is being born.”"],["p","The very structure of the Aeneid is a wink at Homer. The epic is split between an “Odyssean” first half (Books I through VI recount Aeneas’s wanderings as he makes his way from Troy to Italy) and an “Iliadic” second half (Books VII through XII focus on the wars that the hero and his allies wage in order to take possession of their new homeland). Virgil signals this appropriation of the two Greek classics in his work’s famous opening line, “Arms and a man I sing”: the Iliad is the great epic of war (“arms”), while the Odyssey begins by announcing that its subject is “a man”—Odysseus. Virtually every one of the Aeneid’s nine thousand eight hundred and ninety-six lines is embedded, like that first one, in an intricate web of literary references, not only to earlier Greek and Roman literature but to a wide range of religious, historical, and mythological arcana. This allusive complexity would have flattered the sophistication of the original audience, but today it can leave everyone except specialists flipping to the endnotes. In this way, Virgil’s Homeric riff prefigures James Joyce’s, twenty centuries later: whatever the great passages of intense humanity, there are parts that feel like a treasure hunt designed for graduate students of the future."],["p","It is, indeed, hardly surprising that readers through the centuries have found the Aeneid’s first half more engaging. As in the ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/the-odyssey"},"Odyssey"],", there are shipwrecks caused by angry deities (Juno, the queen of the gods, tries to foil Aeneas at every turn) and succor from helpful ones (Venus intervenes every now and then to help her son). There are councils of the gods at which the destinies of mortals are sorted out; at one point, Jupiter, the king of the pantheon, assures the anxious Venus (and, by implication, the Roman reader) that the nation her son is about to found will enjoy ",["em","imperium sine fine"],", “rule without end.” As for the mortals, there are melancholy reunions with old friends and family and hair-raising encounters with legendary monsters. Virgil has a lot of fun retooling episodes from the Odyssey: his hero has close calls with Scylla and Charybdis, lands on the Cyclops’ island just after Odysseus has left, and—in an amusing moment that does an end run around Homer—decides to sail right past Circe’s abode."],["p","And, like Odysseus, Aeneas is dangerously distracted from his mission by a beautiful woman: Dido, the queen of the North African city of Carthage, where the hero has been welcomed hospitably after he is shipwrecked. Venus, eager for her son to find a safe haven there, sends Cupid to make Dido fall in love with Aeneas in Book I, and throughout Books II and III the queen grows ever more besotted with her guest, who holds her court spellbound with tales of his sufferings and adventures. His eyewitness account of the sack of Troy, in Book II, remains one of the most powerful depictions of military violence in European literature, with a disorienting, almost cinematic oscillation between seething, smoke-filled crowd scenes and claustrophobic moments of individual panic. At one point, Aeneas, fleeing the smoldering ruins, somehow loses track of his wife, Creusa; in a chillingly realistic evocation of war’s chaos, we never learn how she dies. As for Dido, her affair with the hero reaches a tragic climax in Book IV. Aeneas, reminded by the gods of his sacred duty, abandons her, and she commits suicide—the emotional high point of the epic’s first half. (The curse she calls down on her former lover is the passage that King Charles selected when he played the ",["em","sortes vergilianae"],".)"],["p","The Aeneid’s first part ends, as does the first half of the Odyssey, with an unsettling visit to the Underworld. Here, there are confrontations with the dead and the past they represent—Dido’s ghost doesn’t deign to acknowledge the apologetic Aeneas’s protestations—and encounters, too, with the glorious future. One of the spirits that Aeneas meets is his father, Anchises, whom he’d carried on his back as they fled Troy, and who has since died; as Anchises guides his son through the murky landscape, he draws his attention to a fabulous parade of monarchs, warriors, statesmen, and heroes who will distinguish the history of the future Roman state, from the mythic king Romulus to Augustus himself. As they witness this pageant, the old man imparts a crucial piece of advice. The Greeks, he observes, excelled at the arts—sculpture, rhetoric—but Rome has a far greater mission in world history:"],["inline-embed",{"type":"callout","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22callout%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22inset-left%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22cartoon%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522cartoon%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%2522%252Fcartoon%252F5bb6632c3f8e152ccafcb604%2522%252C%2522width%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522height%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522caption%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%225bb6632c3f8e152ccafcb604%5C%22%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%22%2C%22attrs%22%3A%7B%7D%7D","ref":""},["inline-embed",{"type":"cartoon","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22cartoon%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22%2Fcartoon%2F5bb6632c3f8e152ccafcb604%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":"5bb6632c3f8e152ccafcb604"}]],["blockquote",["p","Romans, never forget that this will be",["br"],"Your appointed task: to use your arts to be",["br"],"The governor of the world, to bring to it peace,",["br"],"Serenely maintained with order and with justice,",["br"],"To spare the defeated and to bring an end",["br"],"To war by vanquishing the proud."]],["p","This conception of Rome’s strengths—administration, governance, jurisprudence, war—in relation to Greece’s will be familiar to anyone who’s taken a World Civ course.

After the hero arrives in Italy, he favorably impresses a local king named Latinus, who promises his daughter, Lavinia, as a wife for Aeneas. The problem is that the girl has already been chosen for a local chieftain named Turnus, who, smarting from the insult, goes on to command the forces trying to repel the Trojan invaders. And so, like the war recounted in the Iliad, this one is fought over a woman who has been stolen away from her rightful mate—the difference being that this time it’s the Trojans, not the Greeks, who invade a foreign country and ravage a kingdom in order to retrieve her. One challenge presented by the mythic Trojan origins of the Roman people was that the Trojans lost their great war; reshaping his source material, Virgil found a way to transform a story about losers into an epic about winners."]],["inline-embed",{"type":"section","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22section%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cp%3EBut%20what%20does%20it%20mean%20to%20be%20a%20winner%3F%20Anchises%20instructs%20his%20son%20that%2C%20to%20be%20a%20Roman%2C%20he%20must%20become%20(in%20Ferry%E2%80%99s%20translation)%20%E2%80%9Cgovernor%20of%20the%20world.%E2%80%9D%20This%20rendering%20of%20Virgil%E2%80%99s%20phrase%20%3Cem%3Eregere%20imperio%20populos%3C%2Fem%3E%20is%20rather%20mild.%20John%20Dryden%E2%80%99s%201697%20translation%20far%20better%20conveys%20the%20menace%20lurking%20in%20the%20word%20%3Cem%3Eimperium%3C%2Fem%3E%20(%E2%80%9Cthe%20right%20to%20command%E2%80%9D)%3A%20%E2%80%9C%20%E2%80%99tis%20thine%20alone%2C%20with%20awful%20sway%2C%C2%A0%2F%C2%A0To%20rule%20Mankind%3B%20and%20make%20the%20World%20obey.%E2%80%9D%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EJust%20what%20making%20the%20world%20obey%20looks%20like%20is%20vividly%20illustrated%20in%20another%20vision%20of%20the%20future%20that%20the%20Aeneid%20provides.%20In%20Book%20VIII%2C%20there%20is%20a%20lengthy%20description%20of%20the%20sumptuous%20shield%20that%20Vulcan%2C%20the%20blacksmith%20god%2C%20forges%20for%20Aeneas%20before%20he%20meets%20Turnus%20and%20the%20Italian%20hordes%20in%20battle.%20The%20decorations%20on%20the%20shield%20meld%20moments%20both%20mythic%20and%20historical%2C%20past%20and%20future%2C%20from%20Romulus%20and%20Remus%20being%20suckled%20by%20the%20she-wolf%20to%20a%20central%20panel%20depicting%20the%20Battle%20of%20Actium%2C%20with%20Augustus%20and%20his%20brilliant%20general%20Agrippa%2C%20on%20one%20side%2C%20facing%20off%20against%20Antony%20and%20Cleopatra%2C%20on%20the%20other.%20(She%E2%80%99s%20backed%20by%20her%20foreign%20%E2%80%9Cmonster%20gods%E2%80%9D%3A%20that%20%E2%80%9Cmonster%E2%80%9D%20is%20a%20telling%20bit%20of%20Roman%20jingoism%20that%20Ferry%20inexplicably%20omits.)%20The%20shield%20also%20includes%20an%20image%20of%20Augustus%20marching%20triumphantly%20through%20the%20capital%20as%20its%20temples%20resound%20with%20the%20joyful%20singing%20of%20mothers%2C%20while%E2%80%94that%20other%20product%20of%20%3Cem%3Eimperium%3C%2Fem%3E%E2%80%94a%20host%20of%20conquered%20peoples%20are%20marched%20through%20the%20streets%3A%20nomads%2C%20Africans%2C%20Germans%2C%20Scythians.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EYet%20one%20battle%20into%20which%20Aeneas%20carries%20his%20remarkable%20shield%20ends%20with%20the%20hero%20unaccountably%20failing%20to%20adhere%20to%20the%20second%20part%20of%20his%20father%E2%80%99s%20exhortation%3A%20to%20%E2%80%9Cspare%20the%20defeated.%E2%80%9D%20As%20the%20poem%20nears%20its%20conclusion%2C%20the%20wars%20gradually%20narrow%20to%20a%20single%20combat%20between%20Aeneas%20and%20Turnus%2C%20who%2C%20by%20that%20point%2C%20has%20slain%20a%20beautiful%20youth%20called%20Pallas%2C%20Aeneas%E2%80%99s%20ward%20and%20the%20son%20of%20his%20chief%20ally.%20In%20the%20closing%20lines%20of%20the%20poem%2C%20Aeneas%20fells%20Turnus%20with%20a%20crippling%20blow%20to%20the%20thigh.%20While%20his%20enemy%20lies%20prostrate%20before%20him%2C%20the%20hero%20hesitates%2C%20sword%20in%20hand%3B%20but%2C%20just%20as%20thoughts%20of%20leniency%20crowd%20his%20mind%E2%80%94he%20is%2C%20after%20all%2C%20famous%20for%20his%20sense%20of%20duty%2C%20for%20doing%20the%20right%20thing%E2%80%94he%20sees%20that%20Turnus%20is%20wearing%20a%20piece%20of%20armor%20torn%20from%20Pallas%E2%80%99s%20body.%20Seized%20with%20rage%20and%20grief%2C%20Aeneas%20rips%20open%20Turnus%E2%80%99s%20breast%20with%20one%20blow%2C%20and%20the%20dead%20man%E2%80%99s%20soul%20%E2%80%9Cindignant%20fled%20away%20to%20the%20shades%20below.%E2%80%9D%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EThat%20is%20the%20last%20line%20of%20the%20poem%E2%80%94an%20ending%20so%20disorientingly%20abrupt%20that%20it%20has%20been%20cited%20as%20evidence%20by%20those%20who%20believe%20that%20Virgil%20left%20his%20magnum%20opus%20incomplete%20when%20he%20died.%20One%20fifteenth-century%20Italian%20poet%20went%20so%20far%20as%20to%20add%20an%20extra%20book%20to%20the%20poem%20(in%20Latin%20verse)%20tying%20Virgil%E2%80%99s%20loose%20ends%20into%20a%20neat%20bow%3A%20Aeneas%20marries%20Lavinia%20and%20is%20eventually%20deified.%20This%20ending%20was%20so%20popular%20that%20it%20was%20included%20in%20editions%20of%20the%20Aeneid%20for%20centuries%20afterward.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%22%7D","ref":""},["p","But what does it mean to be a winner? Anchises instructs his son that, to be a Roman, he must become (in Ferry’s translation) “governor of the world.” This rendering of Virgil’s phrase ",["em","regere imperio populos"]," is rather mild. John Dryden’s 1697 translation far better conveys the menace lurking in the word ",["em","imperium"]," (“the right to command”): “ ’tis thine alone, with awful sway, / To rule Mankind; and make the World obey.”"],["p","Just what making the world obey looks like is vividly illustrated in another vision of the future that the Aeneid provides. In Book VIII, there is a lengthy description of the sumptuous shield that Vulcan, the blacksmith god, forges for Aeneas before he meets Turnus and the Italian hordes in battle. The decorations on the shield meld moments both mythic and historical, past and future, from Romulus and Remus being suckled by the she-wolf to a central panel depicting the Battle of Actium, with Augustus and his brilliant general Agrippa, on one side, facing off against Antony and Cleopatra, on the other. (She’s backed by her foreign “monster gods”: that “monster” is a telling bit of Roman jingoism that Ferry inexplicably omits.) The shield also includes an image of Augustus marching triumphantly through the capital as its temples resound with the joyful singing of mothers, while—that other product of ",["em","imperium"],"—a host of conquered peoples are marched through the streets: nomads, Africans, Germans, Scythians."],["p","Yet one battle into which Aeneas carries his remarkable shield ends with the hero unaccountably failing to adhere to the second part of his father’s exhortation: to “spare the defeated.” As the poem nears its conclusion, the wars gradually narrow to a single combat between Aeneas and Turnus, who, by that point, has slain a beautiful youth called Pallas, Aeneas’s ward and the son of his chief ally. In the closing lines of the poem, Aeneas fells Turnus with a crippling blow to the thigh. While his enemy lies prostrate before him, the hero hesitates, sword in hand; but, just as thoughts of leniency crowd his mind—he is, after all, famous for his sense of duty, for doing the right thing—he sees that Turnus is wearing a piece of armor torn from Pallas’s body. Seized with rage and grief, Aeneas rips open Turnus’s breast with one blow, and the dead man’s soul “indignant fled away to the shades below.”"],["p","That is the last line of the poem—an ending so disorientingly abrupt that it has been cited as evidence by those who believe that Virgil left his magnum opus incomplete when he died. One fifteenth-century Italian poet went so far as to add an extra book to the poem (in Latin verse) tying Virgil’s loose ends into a neat bow: Aeneas marries Lavinia and is eventually deified.

recently as the early twentieth century, the Aeneid was embraced as a justification of the Roman—and, by extension, any—empire: “a classic vindication of the European world-order,” as one scholar put it. (This position is known among classicists as the “optimistic” interpretation.) The marmoreal perfections of its verse seemed to reflect the grand façades of the Roman state itself: Augustus boasted that he found Rome a city of brick and left it a city of marble."],["p","But in the second half of the last century more and more scholars came to see some of the epic’s most wrenching episodes as attempts to draw attention to the toll that the exercise of ",["em","imperium"]," inevitably takes. This “pessimistic” approach to the text and its relation to imperial ideology has found its greatest support in the account of Aeneas’s treatment of Dido. That passionate, tender, and grandly tragic woman is by far the epic’s greatest character—and, indeed, the only one to have had a lasting impact on Western culture past the Middle Ages, memorably appearing in works by artists ranging from Purcell to Berlioz to Mark Morris."],["p","After the gods order Aeneas to abandon Dido and leave Carthage—he mustn’t, after all, end up like Antony, the love slave of an African queen—he prepares to sneak away.

Much of the Aeneid is fuelled by this torturous conflict between private fulfillment and public responsibility, which was to become a staple of European literature and drama, showing up in everything from Corneille to “The Crown.” (You sometimes get the impression that Virgil himself would like to be free of his poetic duty to celebrate the empire. In Book V, a long set piece about a sailing competition that Aeneas holds for his men, filled with verve and humor, feels like a vacation for the poet, too.)"],["p","When Aeneas does reply to Dido, he’s as cool as a corporate lawyer, rattling off one talking point after another. (Dido has a kingdom of her own, so why shouldn’t he?) But how are we to reconcile this Aeneas with the distraught figure we’re left with at the end of the poem, a man who goes berserk when he’s reminded of the loss of his young ward and who brutally slays a captive supplicant? The contradiction has led to persistent questions about the coherence of Virgil’s depiction of his hero.

Unlike Greek, which is far more supple, it has no definite or indefinite articles; a page of Latin can look like a wall of bricks. As such, it’s particularly difficult to adapt to dactylic hexameter, the waltzlike, oom-pah-pah meter of epic poetry, which the Romans inherited from the Greeks. One of Virgil’s achievements was to bring Latin hexameter verse to an unusually high level of flexibility and polish, stretching long thoughts and sentences over several lines, gracefully balancing pairs of nouns and adjectives, and finding ways to temper the natural heaviness of his native tongue. Alfred, Lord Tennyson, called the result “the stateliest measure ever moulded by the lips of man.”"],["p","David Ferry more than succeeds in capturing the stateliness, as his rendering of the Proem, the epic’s introductory lines, into English blank verse shows:"],["blockquote",["p","I sing of arms and the man whom fate had sent",["br"],"To exile from the shores of Troy to be",["br"],"The first to come to Lavinium and the coasts",["br"],"Of Italy, and who, because of Juno’s",["br"],"Savage implacable rage, was battered by storms",["br"],"At sea, and from the heavens above, and also",["br"],"By tempests of war, until at last he might",["br"],"Bring his household gods to Latium, and build his town,",["br"],"From which would come the Alban Fathers and",["br"],"The lofty walls of Rome."]],["p","Alone among recent translators, as far as I am aware, Ferry has honored the crucial fact that, in the original, this is all one long flowing sentence and one thought: from Troy to Rome, from past to present, from defeat to victory."],["p","But there’s more to Virgil than high polish. Because the Aeneid’s instantaneous status as a classic made its style a standard, it’s difficult to appreciate how innovative and idiosyncratic Virgil’s poetry once felt. One favorite device, for instance, is called “enallage,” in which an adjective is pointedly displaced from the noun it should, logically, modify. Take the last line of the Proem, with its climactic vision of what Ferry renders as “The lofty walls of Rome.” What Virgil actually wrote was stranger: “the walls of lofty Rome.” The poet knew what he was doing—“lofty walls” is about architecture, but “lofty Rome” is about empire."],["p","Ferry’s creamily elegant rendering of the epic, which tries to “correct” the text’s oddness, is likely to leave you wondering why critics both ancient and modern have scratched their heads over Virgil’s verse—his occasionally jarring or archaic diction (mocked by one Roman littérateur who made his point by writing a parody of the poet’s early work); his “tasteless striving for effect,” as Augustus’s friend and general Agrippa complained; his “use of words too forcible for his thoughts,” as A. E. Housman put it two millennia later. It’s these arresting qualities that made Virgil feel modern to his contemporaries—something it’s almost impossible to feel about him in this translation and so many others."]],["inline-embed",{"type":"section","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22section%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cp%3EBut%20perhaps%20we%20don%E2%80%99t%20need%20a%20translation%20to%20drag%20the%20Aeneid%20into%20the%20modern%20era.%20Maybe%20it%E2%80%99s%20always%20been%20here%2C%20and%20we%E2%80%99re%20just%20looking%20at%20it%20from%20the%20wrong%20angle%E2%80%94or%20looking%20for%20the%20wrong%20things.%20Maybe%20the%20inconsistencies%20in%20the%20hero%20and%20his%20poem%20that%20have%20distressed%20readers%20and%20critics%E2%80%94the%20certainties%20alternating%20with%20doubt%2C%20the%20sudden%20careening%20from%20coolness%20to%20high%20emotion%2C%20the%20poet%E2%80%99s%20admiring%20embrace%20of%20an%20empire%20whose%20moral%20offenses%20he%20can%E2%80%99t%20help%20cataloguing%2C%20the%20optimistic%20portrait%20of%20a%20great%20nation%20rising%20haunted%20by%20a%20cynical%20appraisal%20of%20Realpolitik%20at%20work%E2%80%94aren%E2%80%99t%20problems%20of%20interpretation%20that%20we%20have%20to%20solve%20but%2C%20rather%2C%20the%20qualities%20in%20which%20this%20work%E2%80%99s%20modernity%20resides.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EThis%2C%20at%20any%20rate%2C%20is%20what%20was%20going%20through%20my%20mind%20one%20day%20fifteen%20years%20ago%2C%20when%2C%20I%20like%20to%20think%2C%20I%20finally%20began%20to%20understand%20the%20Aeneid.%20At%20the%20time%2C%20I%20was%20working%20on%20a%20book%20about%20the%20Holocaust%2C%20and%20had%20spent%20several%20years%20interviewing%20the%20few%20remaining%20survivors%20from%20a%20small%20Polish%20town%20whose%20Jewish%20population%20had%20been%20obliterated%20by%20what%20you%20could%20legitimately%20call%20an%20exercise%20of%20%3Cem%3Eimperium%3C%2Fem%3E.%20As%20I%20pressed%20these%20elderly%20people%20for%20their%20memories%2C%20I%20was%20struck%20by%20the%20similarities%20in%20the%20way%20they%20talked%3A%20a%20kind%20of%20resigned%20fatalism%2C%20a%20forlorn%20acknowledgment%20that%20the%20world%20they%20were%20trying%20to%20describe%20was%2C%20in%20the%20end%2C%20impossible%20to%20evoke%3B%20strange%20swings%20between%20an%20almost%20abnormal%20detachment%20when%20describing%20unspeakable%20atrocities%20and%20sudden%20eruptions%20of%20ungovernable%20rage%20and%20grief%20triggered%20by%20the%20most%20trivial%20memory.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EMonths%20later%2C%20when%20I%20was%20back%20home%20teaching%20Greek%20and%20Roman%20classics%20again%2C%20it%20occurred%20to%20me%20that%20the%20difficulties%20we%20have%20with%20Aeneas%20and%20his%20epic%20cease%20to%20be%20difficulties%20once%20you%20think%20of%20him%20not%20as%20a%20hero%20but%20as%20a%20type%20we%E2%80%99re%20all%20too%20familiar%20with%3A%20a%20survivor%2C%20a%20person%20so%20fractured%20by%20the%20horrors%20of%20the%20past%20that%20he%20can%20hold%20himself%20together%20only%20by%20an%20unnatural%20effort%20of%20will%2C%20someone%20who%20has%20so%20little%20of%20his%20history%20left%20that%20the%20only%20thing%20that%20gets%20him%20through%20the%20present%20is%20a%20numbed%20sense%20of%20duty%20to%20a%20barely%20discernible%20future%20that%20can%20justify%20every%20kind%20of%20deprivation.%20It%20would%20be%20hard%20to%20think%20of%20a%20more%20modern%20figure.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EOr%2C%20indeed%2C%20a%20more%20modern%20story.%20What%20is%20the%20Aeneid%20about%3F%20It%20is%20about%20a%20tiny%20band%20of%20outcasts%2C%20the%20survivors%20of%20a%20terrible%20persecution.%20It%20is%20about%20how%20these%20survivors%E2%80%94clinging%20to%20a%20divine%20assurance%20that%20an%20unknown%20and%20faraway%20land%20will%20become%20their%20new%20home%E2%80%94arduously%20cross%20the%20seas%2C%20determined%20to%20refashion%20themselves%20as%20a%20new%20people%2C%20a%20nation%20of%20victors%20rather%20than%20victims.%20It%20is%20about%20how%2C%20when%20they%20finally%20get%20there%2C%20they%20find%20their%20new%20homeland%20inhabited%20by%20locals%20who%20have%20no%20intention%20of%20making%20way%20for%20them.%20It%20is%20about%20how%20this%20geopolitical%20tragedy%20generates%20new%20wars%2C%20wars%20that%20will%2C%20in%20turn%2C%20trigger%20further%20conflicts%3A%20%3Cem%3Ebella%20horrida%20bella%3C%2Fem%3E.%20It%20is%20about%20how%20such%20conflicts%20leave%20those%20involved%20in%20them%20morally%20unrecognizable%2C%20even%20to%20themselves.%20This%20is%20a%20story%20that%20both%20the%20Old%20and%20the%20New%20Worlds%20know%20too%20well%3B%20and%20Virgil%20was%20the%20first%20to%20tell%20it.%20Whatever%20it%20meant%20in%20the%20past%2C%20and%20however%20it%20discomfits%20the%20present%2C%20the%20Aeneid%20has%2C%20alas%2C%20always%20anticipated%20the%20future.%C2%A0%E2%99%A6%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%22%7D","ref":""},["p","But perhaps we don’t need a translation to drag the Aeneid into the modern era. Maybe it’s always been here, and we’re just looking at it from the wrong angle—or looking for the wrong things. Maybe the inconsistencies in the hero and his poem that have distressed readers and critics—the certainties alternating with doubt, the sudden careening from coolness to high emotion, the poet’s admiring embrace of an empire whose moral offenses he can’t help cataloguing, the optimistic portrait of a great nation rising haunted by a cynical appraisal of Realpolitik at work—aren’t problems of interpretation that we have to solve but, rather, the qualities in which this work’s modernity resides."],["p","This, at any rate, is what was going through my mind one day fifteen years ago, when, I like to think, I finally began to understand the Aeneid. At the time, I was working on a book about the Holocaust, and had spent several years interviewing the few remaining survivors from a small Polish town whose Jewish population had been obliterated by what you could legitimately call an exercise of ",["em","imperium"],". As I pressed these elderly people for their memories, I was struck by the similarities in the way they talked: a kind of resigned fatalism, a forlorn acknowledgment that the world they were trying to describe was, in the end, impossible to evoke; strange swings between an almost abnormal detachment when describing unspeakable atrocities and sudden eruptions of ungovernable rage and grief triggered by the most trivial memory."],["p","Months later, when I was back home teaching Greek and Roman classics again, it occurred to me that the difficulties we have with Aeneas and his epic cease to be difficulties once you think of him not as a hero but as a type we’re all too familiar with: a survivor, a person so fractured by the horrors of the past that he can hold himself together only by an unnatural effort of will, someone who has so little of his history left that the only thing that gets him through the present is a numbed sense of duty to a barely discernible future that can justify every kind of deprivation. It would be hard to think of a more modern figure."],["p","Or, indeed, a more modern story. What is the Aeneid about? It is about a tiny band of outcasts, the survivors of a terrible persecution. It is about how these survivors—clinging to a divine assurance that an unknown and faraway land will become their new home—arduously cross the seas, determined to refashion themselves as a new people, a nation of victors rather than victims. It is about how, when they finally get there, they find their new homeland inhabited by locals who have no intention of making way for them. It is about how this geopolitical tragedy generates new wars, wars that will, in turn, trigger further conflicts: ",["em","bella horrida bella"],". It is about how such conflicts leave those involved in them morally unrecognizable, even to themselves. This is a story that both the Old and the New Worlds know too well; and Virgil was the first to tell it. Whatever it meant in the past, and however it discomfits the present, the Aeneid has, alas, always anticipated the

the actor ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/daniel-radcliffe"},"Daniel Radcliffe"]," is currently starring in the Broadway show “The Lifespan of a Fact,” as a magazine fact checker with an aviation inspector’s zeal for accuracy. The play is drawn from a real-life skirmish: in 2005, Jim Fingal, an intern at ",["em","The Believer"],", was tasked with fact-checking an essay by John D’Agata (played by Bobby Cannavale), about a teen suicide in Las Vegas. D’Agata had more of a watercolorist’s approach to the truth. When Fingal tried to correct his claim that Las Vegas had thirty-four licensed strip clubs—a source indicated that it was thirty-one—D’Agata said that he liked the “rhythm” of thirty-four. Their epistolary tussle was expanded into a ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/the-art-of-fact-checking"},"book"]," in 2012."],["p","Not long ago, Radcliffe arrived at the offices of this magazine, wearing a maroon cap and a green jacket and clutching a latte. He had come to try his own hand at fact-checking, with the help of ",["em","The New Yorker’s"]," fact-checking department. Radcliffe had a few things to verify himself. Passing a wall displaying recent ",["em","New Yorker"]," covers, he said, “That makes me feel a lot better about our play. We’ve talked about whether an editor would have loads of covers in their office. I’m going to go back and say, ‘Yes.’ ”"],["p","He reported to the office of Peter Canby, the magazine’s head of fact-checking. “One of the flaws—maybe it isn’t a flaw—that my character has in the play is that he has no ability to differentiate between the things that matter and the things that don’t,” Radcliffe said. Canby, who had seen a preview, assured him that his character was spot-on, while allowing, “It’s not really a science. It’s more of an art.”"],["p","Then he put Radcliffe to work. They hunched over a soon-to-run review of ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/10/08/oxomoco-balances-hipster-bait-with-mexican-tradition"},"Oxomoco"],", a Mexican restaurant in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. The first step, Canby explained, was to underline all checkable facts. “Let’s crack on,” Radcliffe said, scanning the line “The dip itself was excellent, laced with chilies in adobo and cilantro and dressed up with cotija cheese and slightly smoky, lightly charred cherry tomatoes.” He underlined everything except “was excellent.”"],["p","The writer (herself a former checker) had noted the restaurant’s “Venice Beach aesthetic”: fact or opinion? Canby designated it a “workable possible impression,” but worth checking. Radcliffe had an eleven-o’clock phone call scheduled with the chef, Justin Bazdarich, and Canby gave him something akin to an acting lesson: “You have to project confidence, so the person doesn’t start quarrelling with everything that you ask.”"],["p","“I’m more nervous about this than I am about going onstage tonight,” Radcliffe said."],["p","Canby had to go; he deputized a checker named Parker Henry to supervise Radcliffe. On her computer, they checked a few easy facts from the restaurant’s Web site, which indicated that, yes, the brunch menu includes a “bowls” section. Then they ducked into a windowless fact-checking library and dialled Bazdarich."],["p","“Hi, Justin. I’m Dan, at ",["em","The New Yorker"],",” Radcliffe began, twiddling a red pencil. “Some of these questions are going to feel very boring and prosaic to you,” he warned. “So bear with me. First off, your surname: is that spelled B-A-Z-D-A-R-I-C-H?” (It is.) “Does the restaurant serve guacamole?” (Yes.) “In the dip itself, would it be right to say there are chilies in adobo and cilantro?” (No adobo, but yes to the cilantro.) “Is there a drink you serve there, a Paloma?” (Yes.) “And that’s pale, pink, and frothy, I believe?” (Correct.) “Is brunch at your place—which, by the way, sounds fantastic—served seven days a week?” (Yes.) “That’s great news,” Radcliffe said, “for the accuracy of this, and for me.”"],["p","He took a breath. “Moving along: you also serve a beef-tartare tostada? (Correct.) “And that has some fried grasshopper on it?” (Actually, the insect is toasted over a wood fire, Bazdarich said. Radcliffe, his pencil trembling, scribbled “toasted.”) “And is that a whole grasshopper you get with each one, or is it sort of segments?” (Whole, but sometimes they break apart.) “Would it be correct to say that meat is a major theme?” Bazdarich seemed skeptical. Radcliffe, panicking, added, “Don’t worry, it is also made mention of that vegetarians or pescatarians can be very, very happy at your restaurants.”"],["p","He got to the dreaded “Venice Beach” line. “Would it be correct to say that you’ve got a very light, sort of California feel inside?” he asked. Bazdarich said that he considered it more Mexican than Californian. “Sorry, yes,” Radcliffe said, laughing nervously. “I’m an English person who has not been to Mexico, so that was my first frame of reference.”"],["p","Radcliffe hung up and exhaled. “I just fact-checked a fucking article!” he said. “Nothing I do today will be harder than that.” A few days later, a ",["em","New Yorker"]," fact checker called Radcliffe to verify the above account. “Very meta,” he said. Everything checked out, except that he had been drinking a cappuccino, not a latte, and he has, in point of fact, been to Mexico. ♦"]]],"canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"sections":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"},"slug":"magazine","children":[{"id":"5bb8106e59f95b2ce7bedfc4","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5bb8106e59f95b2ce7bedfc4","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Red Pencil Dept.","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"red-pencil-dept"},{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"},{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"}],"name":"Red Pencil Dept.","parent":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"},"slug":"red-pencil-dept"}]}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"magazine","contentTags":[],"contentType":"article","contributors":[{"name":"Michael Schulman","type":"author","title":"Michael Schulman has contributed to The New Yorker since 2006.

first evening of fall, members of the boomer-era Ridgewood diaspora, fresh from Florida and Long Island, gathered at Gottscheer Hall to reminisce about adolescence. “We used to rip the antennas off cars and go fight each other,” a woman said, as a bearded man listed bygone rival gangs—the Halsey Bops, the Bleeker Boys—that had prowled the old neighborhood, then an insular enclave of German-speaking immigrants. “But now we’re all friends,” she added. In the faux-Tudor barroom, a man studied a map of Gottschee, part of modern-day Slovenia, near Melania Trump’s birthplace. The garrulous bon vivant of the clan—“the only Sanders voter here”—offered a pink vape, a stein of Spaten, and stories from his life (jail time for armed robbery, service in Vietnam, a turn as a playwright) to a thirtyish filmmaker eating bratwurst. “He keeps calling us millenniums,” the filmmaker whispered to her partner, a Swedish sculptor. A week later, the boomers were gone, a quinceañera raged in the back, and a sampling of the mid-twenties, M-train art set streamed in. Two curators compared tasting notes on Killepitsch liqueur (“children’s Motrin”), grapefruit Schöfferhofer beer (“undertones of Fanta”), and Underberg digestif (“I wish this on my enemy”). In the entry hall, preteens in pink tulle darted past a group of artists gazing at portraits of women in blue-and-white sashes—recipients of the Miss Gottschee crown, appointed at the annual Gottscheer Volksfest, on Long Island—as someone ordered an Uber to the next party, in Bushwick. As they departed, the security guard called out, “You just missed Dorothy!”—Miss Gottschee ’11—“But don’t worry. She’ll be back.” ",["em","(657 Fairview Ave., Queens. 718-366-3030.)"]," ♦"]],"canonicalUrl":"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/10/15/the-cross-generational-appeal-of-gottscheer-hall","categories":{"sections":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"},"slug":"magazine","children":[{"id":"5907ef71ebe912338a37173f","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5907ef71ebe912338a37173f","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Bar Tab","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"bar-tab"},{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"},{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"}],"name":"Bar Tab","parent":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"},"slug":"bar-tab"}]}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"magazine","contentTags":[],"contentType":"article","contributors":[{"name":"H.

the novelist Yan Lianke visits his elderly mother, which he does every two to three months, he is loath to tell anyone he’s coming. As a local boy made good, Yan is acutely aware of the hazards that accompany a publicized homecoming: having to serve as the guest of honor at interminable banquets, being the dedicatee of countless toasts. Inevitably, though, word gets out, and when, in June, I travelled with him from Beijing, where he lives with his wife and son, to Luoyang, the city nearest his ancestral village, a friend had arranged a dinner in his honor."],["p","Luoyang, in Henan Province, is an arid backwater, but its position in the Yellow River Basin made it one of the cradles of Chinese civilization. For fifteen hundred years, from the eleventh century B.C., it was an imperial capital; on its streets, Confucius, a failed official turned itinerant sage, is said to have met Laozi, the founder of Daoism. Nowadays, Luoyang is best known for the Longmen Grottoes, where tens of thousands of Buddha statues have been carved into cliffs on the banks of the Yi River."],["p","Little of this illustrious past was visible as we drove from the train station. Gray office towers and residential high-rises glided by, the legacy of ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/deng-xiaoping"},"Deng Xiaoping"],"’s socialist market economy, along with construction sites for a new subway line and walls plastered with patriotic slogans. But soon we entered a disorienting simulacrum of the past: a labyrinth of imperial gardens, stone bridges, and pagodas with crimson eaves. A statue of Wu Zetian, the only woman in China’s history to hold the title of emperor, in the seventh century, surveyed our arrival with impassive serenity. We had come to Shangyanggong, an opulent new facsimile of Empress Wu’s palace, built on the site of the original and housing a state-controlled entertainment center for tourists. Past a lily pond and a copse of weeping willows, a group of men and women stood dressed in Tang-dynasty robes. One opened Yan’s door, bowing deeply, while another retrieved our luggage from the trunk. As we ascended the steps of the palace, the retinue so adroitly arranged itself around Yan that he resembled a revered emperor or a preëxecution prisoner, depending on your perspective."],["p","Yan jokes that he looks exactly like what his ancestors were for generations: wheat farmers of China’s middle plain, with cheeks the ruddy color of mud houses and arms as tough as the bark of the tung trees at his childhood home. Now sixty, he is trim, with a boxy build and an abundant thatch of graying hair, which sweeps across his forehead in uneven, bristly bangs. His default expression is one of good-natured equipoise, relaxed but attuned to the minutiae of the shifting world around him."],["p","Yan is routinely referred to as China’s most controversial novelist, thanks to his scandalous satires about the brutalities of its Communist past and the moral nullity of its market-driven transformation. In “",["a",{"href":"https://www.amazon.com/Serve-People-Novel-Yan-Lianke/dp/0802170447"},"Serve the People!"],"” (2005), set during the Cultural Revolution, a commander’s wife and her young lover become aroused smashing statuettes of Mao and urinating on his books. Since 2016, almost all of Yan’s work—to date, seventeen novels, as well as short stories, novellas, and volumes of essays—has been subject to an unofficial ban. But his international reputation has grown. He won the Franz Kafka Prize in 2014, has twice been short-listed for the Man Booker International Prize, and is often mentioned as a likely recipient of the Nobel. Yan’s style is experimental and surreal, and he is credited with developing a strain of absurdism that he terms “mythorealism.” As he puts it, “The reality of China is so outrageous that it defies belief and renders realism inert.”"],["p","Henan is ground zero for Yan’s mordant imagination, and in his fiction it becomes a world of remorseless venality—of corrupt local officials, amoral entrepreneurs, and peasants with get-rich-quick schemes that prey on desperation and run on an engine of betrayal. “Some of the most memorable events in history happened here, but, during my lifetime, it’s become one of the poorest places in the country,” he told me. “There is no dignity left, and because of that the people of Henan have felt a deep sense of loss and bitterness.”"],["p","Yan does not exempt himself from his critique; his books often feature an alter ego, also named Yan Lianke, a hack writer who periodically goes back home to gather material.

Where does the funding come from? More often than not, people ended up telling him slightly more than they should."],["p","The complex where we were staying, a gleaming replica of ancient China built for profit, might easily have appeared in Yan’s novel “",["a",{"href":"https://www.amazon.com/Explosion-Chronicles-Novel-Yan-Lianke/dp/0802127258/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1539032804&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=The+Explosion+Chronicles"},"The Explosion Chronicles"],",” in which an unscrupulous village head transforms his community into an environmentally destructive megacity, and enlists its population as thieves and prostitutes. Our host, Zhang Guo, who was in charge of the complex, was an old friend of Yan’s. Previously, he’d been a director of Luoyang tourism, and at the dinner in Yan’s honor he groused about the difficulties of being caught between the expectations of locals and the indifference of officials in Beijing."],["p","A waitress entered with a large bowl of yellow broth, part of a traditional Luoyang meal called the Water Banquet. According to legend, the soup, known as the Swallow Dish, was Empress Wu’s favorite. An imitation peony, carved out of egg, floated regally on top. Zhang suggested that Yan should be writing movie scripts to make money. Yan brushed the idea aside, without mentioning that last year he published a novel in which the fictional Yan Lianke does precisely this. Hungry for fame and fortune, he sets out to write, produce, and direct a true-crime blockbuster, but finds that no one in China will give him any reliable facts and nothing the press reports is true."],["p","After dinner, Yan said that he’d like to hear some Henanese opera; its tunes have captivated him since childhood, and the lyrics often find their way into his novels. Zhang proposed a theatre in Luoyang’s old town, which dates back three thousand years but is currently being redeveloped as yet another historical pastiche aimed at tourists. The theatre was full of businessmen and officials, well fed and tipsy. When we entered, Yan was immediately recognized, and people jumped up to offer him their seats."],["p","Yan told me later that he was disappointed with the performance; people aren’t that interested in real Henanese opera these days, and this was more like a variety show designed to pull in a crowd. In one act, three men put all their weight behind a sword that was thrust against a fourth man’s Adam’s apple—a feat that had the audience writhing in delighted disgust."],["p","As the curtain fell, performers and spectators alike mobbed Yan for selfies and autographs. Eventually, a man drew him aside, introducing himself as the manager of the old town’s redevelopment, and insisted on giving us a tour. As we walked past enormous pagodas whose outlines were illuminated with strings of chili-pepper lights, the man, a former district Party secretary named Wei, told us that the project would take a decade to complete, and would cost two billion dollars."],["p","Wei tottered a bit as he walked and frequently lost his train of thought. He pulled out his phone and showed us a picture of Jiang Zemin, the former President of China, whom he’d led on a tour the month before. Periodically, like a faulty loudspeaker, Wei would chant the project’s slogan: “Preserve the old photographic image of Luoyang. Work to build its new welcome lounge!” Yan nodded graciously as the monologue continued. If he was taking mental notes, he betrayed no judgment. In China, you keep your principles elastic; a favorite proverb of Yan’s is “It’s best to live life with one eye open and the other closed.”"],["p","Steadying himself on a lamppost, Wei halted and, overcome with emotion, pronounced Yan “the pride of Henan.” He said that he was sure he’d read something of Yan’s recently in the ",["em","People’s Daily"],"—the mouthpiece of the Communist Party and perhaps the last paper on earth that his byline would appear in."],["p","“I don’t dare to think that’s true,” Yan said, a hint of mischief creeping into his smile. Then he turned to me and whispered, “No one here has actually read anything I’ve written, or knows that my books are banned. To live in China in 2018 is to inhabit a reality that makes you question the very nature of reality.” The absurdity of the evening’s events seemed, ever so slightly, to please the author. “The people we met today, they know the name Yan Lianke and that he’s a Henanese who’s come by a bit of fame,” he said. “But, in their minds, I might as well be a character in a

mother, who is in her mid-eighties, has been getting frail, and not long ago it occurred to him that, if he wired her allowance annually, rather than in monthly installments, she would be spared many walks to the bank. His mother was horrified by the suggestion: what was the point of receiving money from a rich, filial son if the whole village didn’t witness you hobbling up the road to collect it? Yan describes her as “the most traditional countrywoman you’ll meet”—illiterate and lacking even basic arithmetic skills, but possessed of an inviolable sense of propriety. She had married into the village at the age of sixteen and understood its unwritten laws: your reputation is your worth; debts were to be repaid promptly, because you never knew what fate held. Even if you could afford to make dumplings with meat only once a year, you made sure to deliver a plate to your neighbors before the aroma alerted them to your extravagance."],["p","These days, Yan’s mother barely needed her allowance—he already covered her biggest expenses—so the money went to her greatest indulgence: gifts for villagers who had got married, had a child, or had a death in the family. “To save face is infinitely more fulfilling for my mother than living in comfort,” Yan told me. When we arrived at her house, in Tianhu, thirty-five miles from Luoyang, the first question she asked was how many cartons of cigarettes he’d brought for the villagers."],["p","Yan’s mother gave me a tour of the house—three rooms plus a courtyard garden, planted with tomatoes, corn, bok choy, and string beans—and her Henanese accent was so thick that I had to ask Yan to translate. We sat in the parlor, where a large portrait of ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/mao-zedong"},"Chairman Mao"]," dominated the main wall; beneath it were ancestral tablets devoted to Yan’s father, who died more than thirty years ago, of emphysema, and a small white porcelain bodhisattva. Yan’s brother and one of his sisters were there—he is the youngest of four. The sister was kind enough to caution me against using the bathroom; it was a hole in the ground, whose contents were periodically used to fertilize the soil."],["p","Yan’s mother filled him in on village news while he unpacked a suitcase of things he’d brought for her. When she left the room, his sister hurriedly conveyed the latest developments in a family crisis. For years, the siblings had been trying to get their mother to live with one of them, but she always refused. Eventually, they found a woman in the village who could look after her. The arrangement seemed mutually beneficial: their mother needed someone who could come at a moment’s notice, and the aide, a grandmother herself, could earn some extra cash."],["p","But there was trouble, Yan explained to me, employing the phrase ",["em","zhan pianyi"]," (literally, “occupy small advantages”), which means to be on the sweeter end of a bargain. One legacy of Communism, he believes, is that people think the only way to get ahead is by pulling a fast one of some kind. In an unjust world, ",["em","zhan pianyi"]," becomes a private way of keeping score, so that, even when a deal seems demonstrably equitable, people are always asking themselves if they are being taken advantage of or, preferably, taking advantage of someone else. For the Chinese, Yan said, the feeling of coming out ahead produces a “skewed, misbegotten joy” that has become his mother’s most intense pleasure."],["p","Sensing that it would be a waste not to extract full value from someone who was being paid, his mother pestered the woman constantly. The aide, meanwhile, feeling that her paltry compensation scarcely justified virtual enslavement, started helping herself to small amounts of cash that she found around the house. When Yan’s mother realized, she threatened to fire her, but Yan, doubting that a replacement could be found, secretly upped the woman’s wages. “The worst part was when my mother found that out, too,” Yan told me. What incensed her most, far more than the money itself, was that her own son should have landed her on the losing end of ",["em","pianyi"],". Since then, she’d refused to let the woman in the house, and Yan’s sister had been forced to move in temporarily. In a Communist morality tale, Yan’s mother’s pettiness would have made her the villain. In a Yan novel, she might have been a personification of the fierceness that comes from a lifetime of economic impotence."],["p","Yan and his brother, a retired postman, offered to show me around the village. I asked to see the one-room mud house where Yan was born, and they led me to a windowless concrete box topped with a sheet of corrugated metal. The old house was gone, Yan said, but the story of its destruction was an instructive parable. A dozen years ago, he’d wanted to buy it, but the current owner, a farmer, resisted, and the more money Yan offered the more intransigent the farmer became. One day, a neighbor saw that all the earth around the building had been dug up. Yan realized that the amounts of money he’d been offering had convinced the farmer that there must be valuables buried there. The ethic of ",["em","zhan pianyi"]," dictated that Yan must be trying to lowball him and that he’d be crazy to sell without having discovered what made an uninhabitable mud hut so desirable. The ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/cultural-revolution"},"Cultural Revolution"]," had robbed an entire generation of the concept of sentimental value."],["p","Around that time, Italian and Japanese TV crews had come to film Yan’s birthplace. The county government became interested in turning the place into a cultural-heritage site that might attract visitors, and informed the farmer that he was obligated to sell. One night, in a vengeful rage, the farmer tore the old house down, and then erected the ugly structure that we were looking at. He’d made it as large as possible, in order to extract more compensation from the government, but he’d miscalculated: the state had no interest in buying something that wasn’t Yan’s birthplace, and the building had been abandoned ever since. The spiralling overvaluation of the site had ended up destroying what little value there was."],["p","We continued our walk around the village, sometimes running into people Yan knew, and his Henanese accent thickened with every exchange of greetings. Signs of restless transformation were everywhere, making the village, in Yan’s words, rattle like “a pot of boiling water”: dilapidated homes with “Demolish” scrawled in white chalk on the walls; new buildings covered with white ceramic tiles; asphalt paths where before there had been only dirt. Around us, paulownia and ginkgoes swayed in the wind. There would be more of them, Yan told me, if the older trees had not been cut down in the nineteen-nineties and sold for kindling. Once one villager started doing it, no one could justify not following suit. Yan shook his head. Nobody had thought to ask, If we cut down the trees, what will protect the harvest from the sandstorms? Without the harvest, how will we live? In Yan’s novels, misfortune arrives as the consequence of an external threat, but more often than not it is abetted by shortsighted avarice, which hastens a community’s downfall."],["p","I asked Yan’s brother if he’d read any of Yan’s books. The older man smiled sheepishly. “I’ve tried, but what’s the point?” he said, kicking at an invisible pebble. “It’s all beyond me.”"],["p","Yan patted him lightly on the shoulder in appreciation of his honesty. None of his family members read his books, and what little they know about his criticisms of the government has mostly baffled them. When Yan published “Serve the People!,” the erotic satire of the Cultural Revolution, his brother, looking embarrassed, asked, “Is it true that you have been conscripted to write porn? How hard up are you, brother?”"],["p","A few years ago, the neighborhood in Beijing where Yan lived, which had been built only five years earlier, was bulldozed for a road-widening scheme. He led a residents’ campaign to stop it, writing articles in the national and international press. For Yan, the fight wasn’t about money, though the compensation was inadequate, but about interrogating the arbitrariness of bureaucratic decisions. Yan’s siblings told him that he shouldn’t be stirring up trouble. Why couldn’t he be content with his lot? And, even if it wasn’t about the money, surely getting some compensation was better than

His mother taught him to recognize the most edible kinds of bark and clay. When all the trees had been stripped and there was no more clay, he learned that lumps of coal could appease the devil in his stomach, at least for a little while. As we discussed the famine, I happened to call it the Three Years of Natural Disasters, the government-approved term that I had learned growing up. It was the only time that Yan corrected me in our days together. “Language matters,” he admonished."],["p","Early on, language divided the world Yan was born into from the one he wished to inhabit. He told me, “In the villages, nobody calls life the city word for life, ",["em","shenghuo"],", but ",["em","rizi"],"”—",["em","ri"]," means “sun”—“so if you were a villager your life was nothing but a handful of sunrises to be endured.” For Yan, whose preternatural gift for metaphor spills out of him unbidden, this made sense. “The country has always been the husk that provides nourishment to that precious seed, the city,” he notes. When he was ten or so, during the Cultural Revolution, educated teen-agers from cities arrived in the village, having been sent to the countryside for reëducation. A few of these “sent-down youth” were billeted at his family’s home, and Yan watched his mother feed them the best of what was available, while her own children went hungry."],["p","When he was fourteen, he got a part-time job hauling cement at a factory in Luoyang. It was the first time he had seen street lights and paved roads and buildings that rose three stories—sights that inspired in him an almost religious awe. Around the same time, an uncle who worked at a nearby factory came to the village sporting a white polyester shirt. No one had seen any fabric except cotton before, and the material attracted open admiration. The uncle sensed Yan’s longing and gave him the garment, which Yan wore six days a week, washing it in the evenings and hanging it to dry overnight. “Wearing that white shirt at fourteen gave me the first inkling of what it might be like to carry the mark of the city on your body,” he told me."],["p","In his teens, Yan discovered reading. His eldest sister suffered from a painful bone disease and spent much of her teens bedridden. The villagers lent books, a scarce commodity, to keep her occupied. As Yan put it, “Her tragedy was one of the greatest pieces of luck in my life.” At sixteen, he got a rare copy of the great eighteenth-century novel “",["a",{"href":"https://www.amazon.com/Dream-Red-Chamber-Tsao-Hsueh-Chin/dp/0385093799"},"Dream of the Red Chamber"],",” a book that he now describes as “my first lover.”"],["p","The book that Yan claims to owe his career to is a largely forgotten novel, “Boundary Line,” by Zhang Kangkang; he read in an afterword that its publication, in 1975, had secured Zhang a transfer from a farm in rural Heilongjiang to the city of Harbin. “I did not begin writing out of principle or passion,” Yan likes to say. “I saw the pen as a means of escape.” (He couldn’t have known then that Zhang was from a family of intellectuals and had been sent to the farm for reëducation.) While working sixteen-hour days at the factory, Yan stayed up nights to write his own novel, a four-hundred-page manuscript about the Cultural Revolution, which his mother later used for kindling."],["p","In 1978, at the age of twenty, Yan enlisted in the People’s Liberation Army. On his first night of training, the canteen served pork buns, and, for the first time in his life, he knew what it was like to eat meat until he was full. To the consternation of his commanding officer, he wolfed down eighteen buns in twenty minutes."],["inline-embed",{"type":"callout","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22callout%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22inset-left%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22cartoon%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522cartoon%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%2522%252Fcartoon%252F5bb7cd4c5893512d1157034f%2522%252C%2522width%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522height%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522caption%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%225bb7cd4c5893512d1157034f%5C%22%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%22%2C%22attrs%22%3A%7B%7D%7D","ref":""},["inline-embed",{"type":"cartoon","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22cartoon%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22%2Fcartoon%2F5bb7cd4c5893512d1157034f%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":"5bb7cd4c5893512d1157034f"}]],["p","Yan adapted well to Army life, and, after a year, he joined the Communist Party. His literary talent earned him a place in the propaganda department, and, during the next twenty-five years, he worked his way up to the rank of colonel. The Army transformed his life: he got a degree in political science and, later, one in writing; he was able to arrange for his father, already chronically sick, to be treated at the Army hospital. He has never forgotten the look in his father’s eyes when he arrived at the compound, along with the whole family, after several days of gruelling travel. At the entrance, his father stopped and addressed them solemnly: “All my life, I’ve never been to a proper hospital, and here we are, at the best hospital, an ",["em","Army"]," hospital. We have no money, so they have no reason to treat us, but we’ve travelled for hundreds of miles to be here. If they refuse to receive us, I want everyone to get on their knees. I will kneel, too. We will put our heads to the floor to beg.” His father spent two weeks in the hospital, hooked up to an oxygen tank, and Yan is sure that they were the happiest of his life."],["p","By the mid-nineties, Yan was writing shows for the Army’s TV-production unit, simple stories designed to foster responsibility and idealism, while working on fiction in his spare time. The first of his novels to land him in trouble was “Summer Sunset,” published in 1993; it was quickly banned, and he was ordered to write self-criticism for six months. Yan maintains that he didn’t realize he had crossed a line. The plot centers on the suicide of a young Army cook; two military heroes blame each other for having treated him harshly and become bitter enemies, but eventually a suicide note is found, in which the man says that he suffered from depression and that no one was to blame. The dénouement could have come from one of Yan’s TV scripts, but his unvarnished view of Army life was more than enough to make the book unacceptable."],["p","For years, Yan maintained cordial relationships within the Army, and, even while his books were being censored or banned, some government censors praised them, occasionally asking for signed copies. Advised to tone things down, Yan tried to comply in “",["a",{"href":"https://www.amazon.com/Dream-Ding-Village-Yan-Lianke/dp/0802145728"},"Dream of Ding Village"],"” (2006), but it was a hopeless enterprise, given his topic—the ",["em",{"class":"small"},"AIDS"]," crisis that ravaged Henan in the late nineties, after the government encouraged people to sell their blood to replenish hospital supplies. Small-time entrepreneurs set themselves up as middlemen, known as “bloodheads,” buying blood from villagers and selling it on, but they heedlessly reused needles and failed to screen the blood. The novel is a nightmare of profit-seeking rapacity: once the blood business starts to fail, because so many are dead, the village bloodhead diversifies into selling caskets."],["p","“Ding Village” cemented Yan’s reputation as a dauntless critic of Chinese society, and, by then, he’d been asked to leave the Army. In 2008, he got a job as a literature professor at Renmin University, in Beijing, one of the most prestigious schools in the country. A few years later, he started teaching one semester a year at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. This, too, seemed like an act of escape: Yan experienced what it was like to scale China’s digital firewall and gaze out at a world filled with information and books banned by his motherland."]],["inline-embed",{"type":"section","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22section%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cp%3EIn%20April%2C%20Yan%20came%20to%20New%20York%2C%20to%20visit%20his%20American%20publisher%2C%20Grove%20Atlantic%2C%20in%20advance%20of%20the%20publication%20of%20%E2%80%9CThe%20Day%20the%20Sun%20Died.%E2%80%9D%20International%20travel%20makes%20him%20apprehensive.%20Western%20food%20disagrees%20with%20him%2C%20so%20he%20stuffs%20his%20suitcase%20with%20dried%20ramen%20and%20pickled%20vegetables.%20He%20doesn%E2%80%99t%20speak%20a%20word%20of%20English%20except%20for%20%E2%80%9CLong%20live%20Chairman%20Mao%2C%E2%80%9D%20a%20phrase%20he%20learned%20in%20middle%20school.%20Once%2C%20he%20and%20his%20wife%20got%20stranded%20in%20Brussels%20for%20forty-eight%20hours%20because%20they%20couldn%E2%80%99t%20understand%20the%20transfer%20announcements%20at%20the%20airport.%20So%20he%20was%20glad%20to%20have%20a%20translator%20and%20guide.%20We%20went%20to%20the%20%3Ca%20href%3D%5C%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Ftag%2Fmetropolitan-museum-of-art%5C%22%3EMetropolitan%20Museum%20of%20Art%3C%2Fa%3E%2C%20where%20he%20lingered%20for%20a%20long%20while%20in%20front%20of%20Cubist%20self-portraits%2C%20whose%20geometric%20exaggerations%20struck%20Yan%20as%20%E2%80%9Cbeguiling%20and%20unexpectedly%20moving%E2%80%9D%3B%20and%20to%20Flushing%2C%20where%20he%20was%20so%20tempted%20by%20the%20price%20of%20Nikes%20that%20he%20bought%20pairs%20for%20his%20entire%20family%2C%20despite%20not%20knowing%20anyone%E2%80%99s%20size.%20On%20a%20walk%20down%20Fifth%20Avenue%2C%20what%20impressed%20him%20the%20most%20was%20the%20neatness%20of%20Citi%20Bike%20racks.%20Beijing%20has%20a%20similar%20system%2C%20but%2C%20he%20lamented%2C%20%E2%80%9Cpeople%20carelessly%20dump%20the%20bikes%20on%20the%20ground%20with%20no%20thought%20to%20walkway%20obstruction%20or%20damage%20to%20the%20bike.%E2%80%9D%20He%20surmised%20that%20Communism%2C%20by%20controlling%20every%20aspect%20of%20people%E2%80%99s%20lives%2C%20had%20infantilized%20generations%20of%20Chinese%3A%20%E2%80%9CPeople%E2%80%99s%20sense%20of%20themselves%20as%20individuals%20atrophied%2C%20so%20much%20so%20that%20they%20lost%20commonsense%20ideas%20of%20how%20to%20behave%20ethically%20without%20strict%20parameters.%E2%80%9D%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EAt%20Grove%20Atlantic%E2%80%99s%20offices%2C%20we%20waited%20for%20Morgan%20Entrekin%2C%20the%20C.E.O.%20and%20publisher%2C%20who%20rushed%20in%2C%20extending%20his%20hand%20and%20apologizing%20for%20being%20late%3B%20he%E2%80%99d%20been%20at%20lunch%20with%20%3Ca%20href%3D%5C%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Ftag%2Ftom-stoppard%5C%22%3ETom%20Stoppard%3C%2Fa%3E.%20Trying%20to%20translate%2C%20I%20couldn%E2%80%99t%20remember%20the%20Chinese%20version%20of%20the%20name%20Stoppard%2C%20so%20the%20moment%20passed%2C%20like%20so%20many%20for%20Yan%20when%20he%E2%80%99s%20abroad%2C%20with%20awkward%2C%20uncomprehending%20grinning%20on%20all%20sides.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EAfter%20we%E2%80%99d%20sat%20down%2C%20Entrekin%20asked%20Yan%20about%20the%20political%20situation%20in%20China.%20Yan%20shook%20his%20head%20and%20responded%20that%20it%20was%20beginning%20to%20remind%20him%20of%20the%20Cultural%20Revolution.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EEntrekin%E2%80%99s%20eyes%20widened.%20%E2%80%9CSurely%20it%20can%E2%80%99t%20be%20that%20bad%2C%E2%80%9D%20he%20said.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EYan%20explained%20that%2C%20particularly%20since%20the%20removal%20of%20Presidential%20term%20limits%2C%20last%20year%2C%20he%20had%20sensed%20a%20gradual%20backsliding%2C%20especially%20when%20it%20came%20to%20issues%20of%20free%20speech.%20Not%20only%20has%20he%20frequently%20been%20prevented%20from%20publishing%20new%20books%20but%20publishers%20have%20also%20suppressed%20his%20backlist%3A%20%E2%80%9CAnything%20that%20has%20the%20name%20Yan%20Lianke%20is%20indiscriminately%20removed%20from%20the%20shelves.%E2%80%9D%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EThere%20was%20a%20brief%20silence.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3E%E2%80%9CBut%20you%20are%20recognized%20for%20your%20talent%20outside%20China!%E2%80%9D%20Entrekin%20said%2C%20trying%20to%20rescue%20the%20mood.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3E%E2%80%9CEvery%20year%2C%20when%20the%20Nobel%20Prize%20in%20Literature%20is%20announced%2C%20someone%20is%20sent%20to%20my%20home%20to%20babysit%20me%20in%20case%20I%E2%80%99m%20bombarded%20by%20international%20press%20and%20say%20something%20untoward%2C%E2%80%9D%20Yan%20said.%20%E2%80%9CThe%20worst%20part%20is%20that%20they%20make%20a%20point%20of%20sending%20my%20best%20friend.%20But%20of%20course%20it%E2%80%99s%20a%20smart%20move%3A%20no%20one%20to%20better%20police%20you%20than%20the%20people%20you%20are%20closest%20to.%E2%80%9D%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EEntrekin%20asked%20whether%20Yan%20now%20thought%20of%20himself%20as%20writing%20for%20the%20Chinese%20or%20for%20foreigners.%20Yan%20rubbed%20his%20chin.%20%E2%80%9CIn%20an%20ideal%20world%2C%20I%20want%20to%20write%20for%20my%20countrymen%2C%20but%20I%20know%20that%E2%80%99s%20n

April, Yan came to New York, to visit his American publisher, Grove Atlantic, in advance of the publication of “The Day the Sun Died.” International travel makes him apprehensive. Western food disagrees with him, so he stuffs his suitcase with dried ramen and pickled vegetables. He doesn’t speak a word of English except for “Long live Chairman Mao,” a phrase he learned in middle school. Once, he and his wife got stranded in Brussels for forty-eight hours because they couldn’t understand the transfer announcements at the airport. So he was glad to have a translator and guide.

On a walk down Fifth Avenue, what impressed him the most was the neatness of Citi Bike racks. Beijing has a similar system, but, he lamented, “people carelessly dump the bikes on the ground with no thought to walkway obstruction or damage to the bike.” He surmised that Communism, by controlling every aspect of people’s lives, had infantilized generations of Chinese: “People’s sense of themselves as individuals atrophied, so much so that they lost commonsense ideas of how to behave ethically without strict parameters.”"],["p","At Grove Atlantic’s offices, we waited for Morgan Entrekin, the C.E.O. and publisher, who rushed in, extending his hand and apologizing for being late; he’d been at lunch with ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/tom-stoppard"},"Tom Stoppard"],". Trying to translate, I couldn’t remember the Chinese version of the name Stoppard, so the moment passed, like so many for Yan when he’s abroad, with awkward, uncomprehending grinning on all sides."],["p","After we’d sat down, Entrekin asked Yan about the political situation in China. Yan shook his head and responded that it was beginning to remind him of the Cultural Revolution."],["p","Entrekin’s eyes widened. “Surely it can’t be that bad,” he said."],["p","Yan explained that, particularly since the removal of Presidential term limits, last year, he had sensed a gradual backsliding, especially when it came to issues of free speech. Not only has he frequently been prevented from publishing new books but publishers have also suppressed his backlist: “Anything that has the name Yan Lianke is indiscriminately removed from the shelves.”"],["p","There was a brief silence."],["p","“But you are recognized for your talent outside China!” Entrekin said, trying to rescue the mood."],["p","“Every year, when the Nobel Prize in Literature is announced, someone is sent to my home to babysit me in case I’m bombarded by international press and say something untoward,” Yan said. “The worst part is that they make a point of sending my best friend. But of course it’s a smart move: no one to better police you than the people you are closest to.”"],["p","Entrekin asked whether Yan now thought of himself as writing for the Chinese or for foreigners. Yan rubbed his chin. “In an ideal world, I want to write for my countrymen, but I know that’s not possible and likely won’t be possible in my lifetime,” he said softly. “That’s why I’m so grateful that translation has offered me a lifeline.”"],["p","In practice, the mechanics of censorship in China are opaque. The ban on Yan’s work is de facto rather than official, and his less tendentious titles remain somewhat available. The state has prohibited publishers from printing new copies, but some bookstores reprint old editions, claiming that the reprints come from their inventory. Pirated copies circulate on the black market and on the Internet, and Yan devotees will travel to Hong Kong or to Taiwan for new titles. A young man who showed up at a reading Yan recently gave said that he had been detained for seven days after arguing with customs officers who found two of Yan’s novels in his suitcase."],["p","“I’m lucky, because I don’t have to worry about not having a domestic publisher,” Yan told me. More potent than state censorship is self-censorship. “If you are young and obscure, you are likely unwilling to write anything controversial, because publishers will avoid you.”"],["p","Yan is not exactly a political dissident, and he remains a member of the Communist Party—a club that’s much easier to join than to leave. Over the years, he has honed an instinct for self-preservation through pliancy, deflection, and bemused forbearance. Yan used to joke that the day he managed to learn ten words of English he would move abroad, but he suspects that he wouldn’t feel the same urgency in his work if he left China. “It’s ironic,” he told me. “There is so much anxiety about writing within Chinese borders, but that anxiety is also what I write from.”"],["p","“The Day the Sun Died” takes place during a single evening and night, when a village called Gaotian is stricken by an outbreak of somnambulism, or “dreamwalking”:"],["blockquote",["p","The dreamwalkers appeared as impassive as bricks. While dreamwalking, a dreamwalker could see everything he could possibly imagine, but was unable to see anything from Gaotian and the world outside his dream. He was unable to see a tree or a shrub, unless that tree or that shrub had also appeared in his dream."]],["p","The night unfolds in an escalating series of calamities—suicide, murder, opportunistic looting—as dreamwalking unleashes buried impulses. Yan told me that he intended to probe the inherent falsity of life in China. Communism, he believes, made it impossible to express true feelings in conscious life, and therefore Chinese people are not in the habit of doing so. Because information is so tightly controlled, generations of Chinese have been dreamwalking through life without realizing it, becoming zombies primed to live in accordance with state dictates. Waking up is unimaginable, because living in reality would require one to confront the atrocities of Chinese history, and to understand the catastrophe that the Party has visited on the country. To be Chinese, then, is to live under enforced amnesia, a medicated slumber of propaganda."]],["inline-embed",{"type":"section","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22section%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cp%3EYan%20is%20currently%20writing%20a%20novel%20about%20religion.%20Its%20working%20title%20is%20%E2%80%9CHeart%20Sutra%2C%E2%80%9D%20and%20it%20centers%20on%20five%20visiting%20scholars%20at%20a%20university%2C%20theologians%20in%20China%E2%80%99s%20leading%20faiths%3A%20Buddhism%2C%20Daoism%2C%20Islam%2C%20and%20Christianity%20(one%20Catholic%2C%20one%20Protestant).%20Yan%20does%20not%20believe%20in%20God%2C%20but%20religion%20interests%20him%2C%20because%20he%20considers%20it%20a%20mirror%20of%20society%2C%20of%20what%20animates%20us.%20It%20is%20also%2C%20inevitably%2C%20a%20controversial%20subject%20in%20China.%20The%20Communist%20state%20is%20officially%20atheist%2C%20and%20though%20religious%20adherence%20is%20burgeoning%2C%20there%20has%20been%20a%20crackdown%20on%20its%20expression%20since%20the%20recent%20consolidation%20of%20Xi%20Jinping%E2%80%99s%20authority.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EIn%20Luoyang%2C%20we%20discussed%20this%20situation%20while%20walking%20to%20the%20Longmen%20Grottoes.%20Yan%20spoke%20with%20disdain%20about%20the%20commodification%20of%20the%20site%20for%20tourists.%20There%20were%20shops%20selling%20candy%20and%20hats%2C%20and%20golf%20carts%20ferried%20those%20who%20didn%E2%80%99t%20want%20to%20walk%20to%20the%20site%E2%80%99s%20highlights.%20Tour%20guides%20in%20colorful%20caps%20shouldered%20past%20us%2C%20waving%20flags%20for%20their%20charges%20to%20follow%20and%20broadcasting%20snippets%20of%20Longmen%E2%80%99s%20history%20through%20small%20electronic%20megaphones.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EThe%20construction%20of%20the%20grottoes%20began%20in%20the%20fifth%20century%2C%20when%20Buddhism%2C%20which%20originated%20in%20India%2C%20started%20gaining%20favor%20at%20the%20imperial%20court.%20Longmen%E2%80%99s%20grandeur%20lies%20partly%20in%20a%20refusal%20to%20reveal%20itself%20all%20at%20once.%20Tucked%20into%20the%20limestone%20cliffs%20are%20more%20than%20two%20thousand%20caves%20and%20niches%2C%20with%20nearly%20a%20hundred%20and%20ten%20thousand%20statues%20of%20the%20Buddha%2C%20bodhisattvas%2C%20and%20arhats.%20As%20one%20walks%20closer%20to%20the%20rock%2C%20the%20statues%20disclose%20exquisite%20details%20of%20their%20faces%20and%20poses.%20Out%20of%20the%20walls%20emerge%20grids%20of%20tiny%20bas-relief%20Buddhas%2C%20so%20intricately%20carved%20that%2C%20from%20a%20distance%2C%20the%20rows%20look%20like%20the%20script%20of%20some%20forgotten%20language.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EOver%20the%20centuries%2C%20some%20statues%20have%20been%20vandalized%20or%20stolen.%20During%20the%20Cultural%20Revolution%2C%20when%20relics%20were%20considered%20anti-revolutionary%2C%20many%20were%20decapitated%20or%20had%20their%20faces%20smashed%20in.%20Yan%20recalled%20how%2C%20when%20he%20was%20young%2C%20he%E2%80%99d%20see%20Buddha%20heads%2C%20the%20size%20of%20soccer%20balls%2C%20lying%20on%20the%20ground.%20In%20the%20absence%20of%20toys%2C%20children%20would%20kick%20them%20around%20in%20the%20dirt.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3E%E2%80%9CIn%20China%2C%20the%20development%20of%20religion%20is%20the%20best%20lens%20through%20which%20to%20view%20the%20health%20of%20a%20society%2C%E2%80%9D%20Yan%20said%2C%20as%20we%20navigated%20a%20metal%20walkway%20that%20snaked%20in%20and%20out%20of%20the%20caves.%20%E2%80%9CEvery%20religion%2C%20when%20it%20is%20imported%20to%20China%2C%20is%20secularized.%20The%20Chinese%20are%20profoundly%20pragmatic.%20We%20worry%20about%20our%20reputation%2C%20our%20face%2C%20the%20oil%2C%20salt%2C%20and%20vinegar%20of%20daily%20life.%20What%20is%20absent%20in%20Chinese%20civilization%2C%20what%20we%E2%80%99ve%20always%20lacked%2C%20is%20a%20sense%20of%20the%20sacred.%20There%20is%20no%20room%20for%20higher%20principles%20when%20we%20live%20so%20firmly%20in%20the%20concrete.%20The%20possibility%20of%20hope%20and%20the%20aspiration%20to%20higher%20ideals%20are%20too%20abstract%20and%20therefore%20get%20obliterated%20in%20our%20dark%2C%20fierce%20realism.%E2%80%9D%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EThe%20rock%20carvings%20of%20Longmen%20reached%20their%20apogee%20during%20the%20rule%20of%20Empress%20Wu.%20For%20Wu%2C%20Buddhism%20was%20not%20only%20a%20religion%20but%20also%20a%20means%20of%20establishing%20political%20legitimacy%2C%20particularly%20after%20she%20seized%20the%20throne%20from%20her%20son%2C%20Emperor%20Zhongzong%20of%20Tang.%20Proclaiming%20herself%20an%20incarnation%20of%20the%20Maitreya%20Buddha%2C%20she%20shored%20up%20her%20power%20by%20imprisoning%20members%20of%20the%20Tang%20imperial%20line%20and%20had%20many%20political%20opponents%20exiled%20or%20killed.%20She%20established%20a%20secret%20police%20network%2C%20and%20placed%20spies%20throughout%20the%20country.%20In%20a%20prototype%20of%20the%20surveillance%20state%2C%20she%20instigated%20policies%20to%20encourage%20informants%2C%20installing%20metal%20boxes%20on%20the%20sides%20of%20administrative%20buildings%20for%20an

is currently writing a novel about religion. Its working title is “Heart Sutra,” and it centers on five visiting scholars at a university, theologians in China’s leading faiths: Buddhism, Daoism, Islam, and Christianity (one Catholic, one Protestant). Yan does not believe in God, but religion interests him, because he considers it a mirror of society, of what animates us. It is also, inevitably, a controversial subject in China. The Communist state is officially atheist, and though religious adherence is burgeoning, there has been a crackdown on its expression since the recent consolidation of Xi Jinping’s authority."],["p","In Luoyang, we discussed this situation while walking to the Longmen Grottoes. Yan spoke with disdain about the commodification of the site for tourists. There were shops selling candy and hats, and golf carts ferried those who didn’t want to walk to the site’s highlights. Tour guides in colorful caps shouldered past us, waving flags for their charges to follow and broadcasting snippets of Longmen’s history through small electronic megaphones."],["p","The construction of the grottoes began in the fifth century, when Buddhism, which originated in India, started gaining favor at the imperial court. Longmen’s grandeur lies partly in a refusal to reveal itself all at once. Tucked into the limestone cliffs are more than two thousand caves and niches, with nearly a hundred and ten thousand statues of the Buddha, bodhisattvas, and arhats. As one walks closer to the rock, the statues disclose exquisite details of their faces and poses. Out of the walls emerge grids of tiny bas-relief Buddhas, so intricately carved that, from a distance, the rows look like the script of some forgotten language."],["p","Over the centuries, some statues have been vandalized or stolen. During the Cultural Revolution, when relics were considered anti-revolutionary, many were decapitated or had their faces smashed in. Yan recalled how, when he was young, he’d see Buddha heads, the size of soccer balls, lying on the ground. In the absence of toys, children would kick them around in the dirt."],["p","“In China, the development of religion is the best lens through which to view the health of a society,” Yan said, as we navigated a metal walkway that snaked in and out of the caves. “Every religion, when it is imported to China, is secularized. The Chinese are profoundly pragmatic. We worry about our reputation, our face, the oil, salt, and vinegar of daily life. What is absent in Chinese civilization, what we’ve always lacked, is a sense of the sacred. There is no room for higher principles when we live so firmly in the concrete. The possibility of hope and the aspiration to higher ideals are too abstract and therefore get obliterated in our dark, fierce realism.”"],["p","The rock carvings of Longmen reached their apogee during the rule of Empress Wu. For Wu, Buddhism was not only a religion but also a means of establishing political legitimacy, particularly after she seized the throne from her son, Emperor Zhongzong of Tang. Proclaiming herself an incarnation of the Maitreya Buddha, she shored up her power by imprisoning members of the Tang imperial line and had many political opponents exiled or killed. She established a secret police network, and placed spies throughout the country. In a prototype of the surveillance state, she instigated policies to encourage informants, installing metal boxes on the sides of administrative buildings for anonymous tipoffs."],["p","We arrived at the Fengxian Temple cave, the largest of the complex, whose figures are held to be the apex of Tang-dynasty Buddhist sculpture. In the middle—flanked by bodhisattvas, heavenly kings, and thunderbolt holders—is the Vairocana Buddha, a colossal seated figure in a delicately carved rippling tunic. It is the largest statue in the complex, nearly sixty feet high, with drooping ears that are taller than the average man. Gazing up, one has the sense that this massive being could crush you. The Buddha was financed by Empress Wu, and its face is said to have been modelled on hers."],["p","“What is an emperor but the Buddha of the mortal realm?” Yan asked with a sardonic grin. The day before, he and his friend Zhang had been discussing a powerful monk who enjoyed the patronage of a senior Party official.

we headed back to Beijing, Yan took me to a place that he prefers to Luoyang’s more popular tourist destinations: a mausoleum that was unearthed during construction work in 2002. The burial chamber, which is now a museum, dates back to at least the third century B.C., when the city was the capital of the Zhou dynasty. To archeologists’ astonishment, the occupant of the tomb was buried with an entire fleet of chariots and seventy horses. It was late afternoon as Yan and I walked there across a park. Calligraphers, wielding enormous white-tipped brushes, glazed the concrete with characters written in water. A troupe of senior citizens practiced a dance routine to the Mao-era revolutionary song “The East Is Red,” which crackled from a loudspeaker. As we passed, Yan said, “What people don’t realize is that, for those of a certain generation, playing these propagandistic songs is more about nostalgia than politics—it’s their youth.”"],["p","Yan often thinks about how he came to embark on a path so different from the one the rest of his family took. “I’m quite certain I’m not smarter than my siblings,” Yan said as we walked. “In fact, I suspect it’s the other way around.” He told me a story about the sister I’d met. They’d started school at the same time, and she’d consistently done better than him. One day, when he was about eleven, their parents said that they could afford for only one of them to return to school. There were simply too many mouths to feed, too much land unplowed, and too few hands to spare. It was lunchtime; looking down at his food, he couldn’t bring himself to swallow. Her grades were so much better than his. “That’s when I felt the savageness of my own selfishness,” he said. “The way its flames licked at me from the inside.”"],["p","The possibility of being a prisoner to the land terrified him. “I had never felt such rage,” Yan told me. “What I wouldn’t have done to tear away from her what I knew in my heart belonged to her.” Between them, they had to make a choice, Yan’s mother instructed. He sat in the courtyard, watching the shadow of a tree grow long and then short until it was dissolved by darkness. But his sister walked far off and didn’t return until even later. She had made her decision: he should go, because he was a boy, and that was the way things worked."],["p","Yan writes about this episode in a memoir, his most popular book in China, though as yet unavailable in English. The book, published in 2009, is called “",["a",{"href":"https://www.amazon.com/Father-Generation-I-Chinese/dp/7020116728"},"My Father’s Generation and I"],",” and he told me that he wrote it out of guilt. “I realized that, in writing about my father and my uncles, I was conjuring my own alternative existence, another way my life might have turned out,” he said. “My father and his father had hard, bitter lives. Their struggles were unremarkable, but their bullheadedness—the city word for it would have been ‘perseverance,’ I suppose—is something I admire and pity.”"],["p","We descended into the tomb museum, apparently the only visitors. A viewing platform surrounded a long rectangular pit of yellow earth, and the chariots were arranged as they’d been found, in rows, the largest at the center. The horse skeletons were laid neatly on their sides next to the chariots. A guide told us that their identical poses suggested that they’d been drugged before they were sacrificed. She explained that horses were so valued in ancient China that strict laws stipulated how many were permissible for each social rank. Only the emperor was allowed to have a chariot drawn by six horses, the number that lay beside the large chariot in the middle."],["p","Yan has always found this grave more impressive than the Terracotta Army, in Xi’an; giving this emperor what he needed in the afterlife had involved real killing. China in the Zhou era was a slave society—one horse was worth five slaves—and a human skeleton had been found here, likely that of a stable hand. There were also hunting dogs, and it seemed that no one had bothered to drug them. They were found under the chariots, and would probably have been buried alive or crushed to death. However, one dog skeleton was found not under a chariot but to the side, its front paws outstretched, hind legs braced, body bent double with effort. This dog in particular moves Yan. He imagines that it was the smartest dog of the pack, the one that realized, at the last moment, what was happening. He can’t decide whether the creature was blessed or cursed—whether it is better to be exposed to the reality of one’s circumstances or to be anesthetized by ignorance. Is there a more ferociously alive spectacle than that of beings clawing themselves out of their circumstances? It was, Yan said, as we turned to leave, “a fleeting life memorialized in its final reckoning—the refusal to submit to fate.” ♦"]]],"canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"sections":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"},"slug":"magazine","children":[{"id":"59112bb5df652b705f4abe45","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"59112bb5df652b705f4abe45","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Life and Letters","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"life-and-letters"},{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"},{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"}],"name":"Life and Letters","parent":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"},"slug":"life-and-letters"}]}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"magazine","contentTags":[],"contentType":"article","contributors":[{"name":"Jiayang Fan","type":"author","title":"Jiayang Fan became a staff writer at \u003cem&gt;The New Yorker\u003c/em&gt; in 2016.","email":"","bio":["div",["p","Jiayang Fan became a staff writer at ",["em","The New Yorker"]," in 2016.

Douglass, who has been called the greatest American of the nineteenth century, grew up as a slave named Frederick Bailey, and the story of how he named himself in freedom shows how complicated his life, and his world, always was. Frederick’s father, as David W. Blight shows in his extraordinary new biography, “",["a",{"href":"https://www.amazon.com/Frederick-Douglass-David-W-Blight/dp/1416590315/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1539005976&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=Frederick+Douglass%3A+Prophet+of+Freedom"},"Frederick Douglass: Prophet of Freedom"],"” (Simon &amp; Schuster), was almost certainly white, as Douglass knew early on, and there is something almost cruelly parodic in the grand name the child slave was given: Frederick Augustus Washington Bailey. Escaping to freedom in 1838, at the age of twenty, and needing a new name—in part as a declaration of a reinvented self, in part for the practical necessity of eluding the slave-catchers—he chose to become Frederick Douglass, in honor of a character in a Walter Scott poem. (He added an extra “s” for distinction.)"],["p","What’s curious is that this was a completely Southern choice, a tribute to the culture he was escaping. The South, as Mark Twain protested at length, had long been hostage to a cult of Walter Scott’s neo-medievalism, one of the opiates of Southern “gallantry” that justified the concentration-camp culture as a leisurely and gracious one, a myth so durable that it shaped the most successful American movie ever made, “",["a",{"href":"https://www.amazon.com/Gone-Wind-Clark-Gable/dp/B002W7DSLW/ref=sr_1_1?s=movies-tv&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1539006022&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Gone+with+the+Wind&amp;refinements=p_n_format_browse-bin%3A2650306011"},"Gone with the Wind"],".” But the choice is also a reminder that the wind in Romanticism, and in Walter Scott, could blow both ways, toward liberal nationalism and self-renewal as well as toward feudal nostalgia and hierarchy. Douglass’s new name was as much a rejection of his slave name as was ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/Malcolm-X"},"Malcolm X"],"’s rejection of his birth name, Little—but in this case the chosen name denoted not an absence but a presence. The name he chose inscribed him within a cultural tradition that he had been forced to inherit and chose to remake. This insistence on seeing past the evils of the Enlightenment in search of the light that was still left there made him one of the most radical ",["em","readers"]," of the American nineteenth century. No one was ever a more critical reader of the ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/constitution"},"Constitution"],", or, in the end, a more compelling advocate of its virtues."],["p","With Douglass, then, we have everything and its opposite—the slave wielding a sword of vengeance against the South who adopted the South’s mythology for his own; the militant prophet of the truth that no compromise with slavery was possible who became a central pillar of pragmatic politics in the postwar era. In telling this great story, Blight, a historian at Yale, confronts one great difficulty: Douglass himself wrote his own life three times, each time thrillingly well, though each time with a slightly different purpose. Like the Gospels, each is written with a different ideological agenda. In 1845, “",["a",{"href":"https://www.amazon.com/Narrative-Frederick-Douglass-American-Slave/dp/161382291X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1539006088&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=Narrative+of+the+Life+of+Frederick+Douglass%2C+an+American+Slave"},"Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave"],",” was written as a straightforward abolitionist horror story, albeit an exceptionally humane and potent one. Ten years later came “",["a",{"href":"https://www.amazon.com/My-Bondage-Freedom-Penguin-Classics/dp/0140439188/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1539006134&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=My+Bondage+and+My+Freedom"},"My Bondage and My Freedom"],",” a fuller and more nuanced-novelistic account of the same story. And then, in 1881, when he was in his sixties, he published “",["a",{"href":"https://www.amazon.com/Frederick-Douglass-Autobiographies-Narrative-American/dp/0940450798/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1539006161&amp;sr=8-4&amp;keywords=life+and+times+of+frederick+douglass"},"Life and Times of Frederick Douglass"],",” in which this man, who had watched the ships go by in the Chesapeake Bay with a desperate sense of disbelief that anyone or anything in the world could be so free, was able to report on his journeys to Cairo and Paris and his reception in both as a man of state and of letters."],["p","The prose style in the three memoirs alters under the pressure of the changing agenda: the first time pained and urgent, the second subtler and more considered, the last orotund and outward. Yet, as Blight shows, the tale Douglass wove about himself, from the first to the last volume, is remarkably faithful to what can be dug up independently about the facts of his early life. So Blight’s biography, particularly in its early pages, is necessarily a kind of palimpsest: he dives back and forth beneath Douglass’s texts, sifting and sorting and weaving."],["p","The story, simply told, is that Douglass was largely spared the worst of slavery by inhabiting its more familial edges, at a time when who owned you and where you were owned shaped the course of your life as someone else’s property. After he had been passed from his brutal first master to the man’s kinder son-in-law, Thomas Auld, the transforming event of Douglass’s life was his arrival in ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/baltimore"},"Baltimore"],", at the age of eight, to live with members of Auld’s family. City slaves were better treated than country slaves. “A city slave is almost a freeman, compared with a slave on a plantation,” Douglass wrote. “He is a desperate slaveholder who will shock the humanity of his non-slaveholding neighbors with the cries of his lacerated slave.” As a child, he had, unusually, been treated more or less as an equal playmate of his first master’s son, and soon Sophia Auld, the wife of Thomas’s brother, began to teach him to read and write."],["p","Absolute power, even when well meant, always becomes arbitrary. Sophia first took immense pleasure at Frederick’s celerity as a pupil, and then, under the pressure of her husband’s disapproval (“If you teach that nigger how to read, there would be no keeping him”), turned violently against the boy’s education. Frederick persisted, trading bits of bread with street urchins for secret reading lessons. Here, as elsewhere in his life, he defeated the expected racism of his fellows by the sheer magnetism of his manner."],["p","He was also able to take advantage of the oppressor’s hypocrisy: slavery being a Christian institution, it was important to expose the slaves to the Gospels. This meant that the innocent business of studying the Bible could be turned to the subversive aim of acquiring literacy. Having learned to read by literally buying words, Douglass had an intense sense of the power of language, of the double meanings of individual words; irony was ingrained in him. He heard the word “abolition,” for instance, as a mysterious, forbidden incantation; he didn’t know precisely what “abolition” meant, but he could tell from the murmur around it that it mattered enormously."],["p","He loved Baltimore, but was wrenched out of it when he was fifteen and sent a year later to be “broken” in the backwoods by a cruel overseer named Edward Covey. Making up his mind that he would die trying to sustain his manhood, he attacked Covey, with the result, by no means guaranteed, that Covey backed off. Douglass thought this a proof of the powers of resistance, but he also knew that such resistance usually brought instant death or else shipment down to the plantations of the Deep South—a living death. In fact, he was shipped off to the backwoods, where he tried and failed to escape. Then a remarkable piece of good fortune came his way. Auld, for reasons still mysterious—from humanity or guilt or a buried sense of kinship?—meekly took him back to Baltimore and promised to free him after a seven-year hitch. It was, as Douglass came to recognize, the great salvation of his life. In 1848, he wrote an open letter to Auld, saying, “I entertain no malice toward you personally. . . . There is no roof under which you would be more safe than mine, and there is nothing in my house which you might need for your comfort, which I would not readily grant. . . . ",["em","I am your fellow-man, but not your slave."],"” That letter was a kind of propaganda piece, to show the slave’s moral superiority to his master, but it was sincere as well as shrewd."],["p","In Baltimore that second, salvaged time, he fell in love with a free black woman, Anna Murray. It is still a little hallucinatory to be reminded that, in the border states, free blacks, second-class citizens but citizens still, lived side by side with those who were property. Murray emboldened Douglass to escape and he fled to freedom disguised as a sailor. The account of his flight north stops one’s heart to read, so near did he come to apprehension. (A worker whom he knew from the docks saw him, recognized him, and—kept silent.)"],["p","In 1841, three years after he got a job as a laborer in New Bedford, Massachusetts, where he made a name speaking at the local A.M.E. Zion church, he was brought to an abolitionist meeting in Nantucket, a booming whaling port, and made an impromptu speech that changed history. No one had ever heard an ex-slave speak with such precision and eloquence about his experiences. The eminent white abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison and his followers pressed him into service as a speaker, and Douglass spent the next fifteen years riding trains from one abolition meeting to the next while Anna, now his wife, who had come north after him, waited in New Bedford and raised an ever-growing crop of children. (They had five in all, including three sons who served in the ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/civil-war"},"Civil War"],", one of them surviving, improbably, the massacre of Robert Gould Shaw’s regiment at Fort Wagner.)"],["p","Like many other young and still unformed activists who discover in themselves a gift for oratory, Douglass had to self-educate even as he was speaking. Young orators’ tongues are formed before their minds are set.

She embodied the reality, confounding to sexists, that a woman who looked like her could be a radical egalitarian about gender. Douglass embodied the reality, confounding to racists, that a black man could be charismatic, imposing, educated, and a voice for absolute emancipation.

The slave woman is at the mercy of the fathers, sons or brothers of her master. The thoughtful know the rest."]],["p","His early memoirs find a balance between outrage and subtle irony—those angry, understated phrases: “an unscriptural institution”; “the thoughtful know the rest”—in describing the wrenching effects of slavery on the human soul. Pointing out that one would expect slave masters to be kind to their own children, he coolly analyzes the truth: “Men do not love those who remind them of their sins unless they have a mind to repent—and the mulatto child’s face is a standing accusation against him who is master and father to the child. What is still worse, perhaps, such a child is a constant offense to the wife. She hates its very presence.” What would be a buried subject in most American writing about black-white relations was with Douglass overt, in a way that must have intimidated his followers and

They met and became friends at that 1841 gathering in Nantucket. Garrison, the most famous abolitionist of the period, was the headliner when Douglass was asked to tell the story of his life. Overwhelmed by Douglass’s eloquence, Garrison asked the crowd, “Have we been listening to a thing, a piece of property or a man?” Douglass went on the road as a Garrisonite."],["p","Less than a decade later, they broke, bitterly and for life. Some of the bitterness arose from Douglass’s uneasy sense that he was not so much being used as being put on display.

They’re strangely similar: the black man discovers a gift for oratory, is instantly pressed into propaganda service by a white radical organization, and has a deeply ambivalent relation with his new white friends, who are just a little too much like his old white masters."],["p","Douglass’s break with Garrison also derived from a decisive intellectual difference, one that still sculpts American politics—with the irony that the white crusader was the more conventionally radical actor, and the black ex-slave seemingly the more “moderate.” Garrison was both a pacifist and a moral secessionist. He believed that the Constitution was so deeply implicated in slavery—including its creation of the small-state-favoring Senate—that it could not be salvaged. Douglass came to believe that the Constitution was a good document gone wrong—that, in its democratic premises, it breathed freedom, and that it needed only to be amended to be restored to its first purposes."],["p","Douglass most forcefully offered this insistence in his 1852 “Fourth of July” speech in Rochester. It is a masterpiece of startling argumentative twists. He begins with unstinting praise of the values and character of the Founding Fathers—the only forewarning of dissent being his speaking of the events of the seventeen-seventies in the second person: ",["em","your"]," Founders did this . . . ",["em","your"]," history says that. Then he makes his thundering turn: “The existence of slavery in this country brands your republicanism as a sham, your humanity as a base pretense, and your Christianity as a lie.” Finally, he makes a still more surprising swerve, back toward the American center: the Constitution is solid, all that needs fixing is our way of reading it. “Interpreted as it ought to be interpreted, the Constitution is a ",["em",{"class":"small"},"GLORIOUS LIBERTY DOCUMENT"],". Read its preamble, consider its purposes. Is slavery among them? Is it at the gateway? or is it in the temple? It is neither.”"],["p","The constitutional issue was, and remains, epic. All of American liberalism remains at stake in this choice—it is what divides Obama from Cornel West and his other critics on the left. For Garrison, the failure of liberal constitutionalism to achieve its stated aim was a reason to abandon it. For Douglass, the failure of liberal constitutionalism to achieve its stated aim was a reason to re-state the aim more forcefully and more inclusively. If the aim was in the document, the arc could yet be completed. He thought the aim was there, and the arc was possible."],["p","The philosopher Robert Gooding-Williams, an astute reader of Douglass, sees him as drawn to the “possibility of refounding the Union on the basis of a reconstituted practice of citizenship.” Douglass’s belief in the integrity of the American Constitution made him, ironically, less willing to wait for legislative remedies and readier to use violence against the slave establishment. This became Lincoln’s reasoning, too, evident in his legendary speech at Cooper Union, in 1860: the historical evidence showed that the signers of the Constitution considered slavery a national question, up for national debate. It wasn’t a local or a states’-rights question. Wrongly decided once, it was still on the agenda of the nation as a whole. In the name of the Constitution, slavery was to be assaulted frontally. (How frontally Lincoln could not decide, until events overtook him as President.) For Douglass, this urge to fight for principle, while making sure that the fight could be won, shaped his strange push-and-pull relationship with John Brown, in itself a mini American epic."],["p","As Blight relates, Douglass was, in the eighteen-fifties, drawn by Brown’s courage during the Kansas question—the question of whether slavery was to extend into the new territories—and by the implacable nature of his antislavery views. Where even the Garrisonites condescended to blacks, Brown, as the Harvard historian John Stauffer showed in “",["a",{"href":"https://www.amazon.com/Black-Hearts-Men-Abolitionists-Transformation/dp/0674013670/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1539006779&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=The+Black+Hearts+of+Men"},"The Black Hearts of Men"],"” (2002), envied the courage and “manhood” of the escaped slaves, and was almost ashamed of his own whiteness. Yet Douglass was repelled by Brown’s fanaticism: morally clear-eyed on the subject of slavery, Brown was crazy on the subject of what to ",["em","do"]," about slavery, moved by bloodlusts and Biblicism and incapable of reasoning about means and ends. Douglass dallied with Brown and then, abruptly, withdrew his support from the Harper’s Ferry raid. Simple arithmetic, he saw, meant that it would achieve nothing and endanger the lives of any slaves who participated. Violent means would be necessary, but violence was justified only when it had a chance to prevail."],["p","After the disaster of Harper’s Ferry, some officials in New York tried to have Douglass arrested as a conspirator, and he prudently fled, first to Canada and then to Britain. It was a mistake on the part of his persecutors to force him into exile, however temporary. A huge hit as a lecturer in England and Scotland, he rallied the already strong antislavery forces there."]],["inline-embed",{"type":"section","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22section%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cp%3EMoral%20consensus%20can%20shift%20with%20enormous%20rapidity.%20Not%20so%20very%20long%20ago%2C%20it%20was%20acceptable%20to%20cast%20the%20American%20Civil%20War%20as%20a%20tragic%20clash%20between%20two%20decent%20sides.%20In%20%3Ca%20href%3D%5C%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Ftag%2FKen%2520Burns%5C%22%3EKen%20Burns%3C%2Fa%3E%E2%80%99s%201990%20PBS%20series%20on%20the%20war%2C%20Shelby%20Foote%20declared%2C%20speaking%20through%20his%20soft%20beard%20with%20his%20gentle%20drawl%2C%20that%20the%20problem%20was%20that%20the%20North%20and%20the%20South%20somehow%20couldn%E2%80%99t%20find%20a%20compromise.%20It%20has%20since%20become%20harder%20to%20deny%20the%20truth%20that%20slavery%20was%20the%20sole%20cause%20of%20the%20war.%20What%20made%20war%20inevitable%2C%20then%2C%20was%20the%20election%20of%20President%20Lincoln%2C%20a%20single-issue%20candidate%20who%20had%20made%20his%20name%20by%20calling%20for%20an%20end%20to%20slavery%E2%80%99s%20extension%20and%20by%20recognizing%20it%20as%20an%20absolute%20evil.%20The%20one%20conceivable%20compromise%20that%20might%20have%20been%20tried%20was%20a%20gradual%20program%20of%20subsidized%20emancipation%2C%20but%2C%20as%20Lincoln%20discovered%20from%20his%20correspondence%20in%20early%201861%20with%20Alexander%20Stephens%2C%20the%20eventual%20Vice-President%20of%20the%20Confederacy%2C%20the%20Southern%20ruling%20class%20had%20made%20up%20its%20mind%3A%20slavery%20or%20secession.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EWhile%20slavery%20was%20the%20war%E2%80%99s%20sole%20cause%2C%20however%2C%20it%20was%20not%20the%20war%E2%80%99s%20sole%20or%20even%20its%20most%20important%20rallying%20cry.%20To%20the%20antislavery%20cause%20was%20added%20the%20pro-Union%20cause%2C%20a%20narrowly%20nationalist%20crusade.%20This%20aspect%20of%20the%20President%E2%80%99s%20war-making%20is%20why%20Edmund%20Wilson%20impatiently%20compared%20Lincoln%20to%20Bismarck%E2%80%94both%20seen%20as%20iron-hearted%20nationalists%20who%20taught%20their%20people%20to%20die%20for%20the%20idea%20of%20national%20greatness.%20And%20there%E2%80%99s%20no%20doubt%20that%20%E2%80%9CWe%20won%E2%80%99t%20let%20you%20Rebs%20walk%20away%20with%20our%20one%20country!%E2%80%9D%20was%20a%20more%20motivating%20cry%20at%20Gettysburg%20than%20%E2%80%9CYou%20must%20never%20again%20keep%20slaves!%E2%80%9D%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EDouglass%20came%20to%20see%20that%20Lincoln%20had%20wrapped%20the%20right%20cause%20around%20the%20wrong%20cry.%20The%20ingenuity%20of%20the%20Gettysburg%20Address%20as%20a%20forensic%20argument%20lies%20in%20the%20way%20it%20made%20the%20two%20causes%E2%80%94nationalism%20and%20emancipation%E2%80%94seem%20one.%20The%20nation%20was%20born%20in%20the%20view%20that%20all%20men%20are%20created%20equal%3B%20slavery%20denies%20that%20view%3B%20if%20we%20lose%20the%20war%2C%20it%20shows%20the%20world%20that%20a%20nation%20with%20that%20premise%20cannot%20survive%20unfragmented%3B%20and%20therefore%20fighting%20for%20the%20Union%20is%20the%20same%20thing%20as%20fighting%20for%20its%20first%20principles.%20Douglass%20admired%20the%20somewhat%20sophistic%20logic.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EDuring%20the%20war%20years%2C%20he%20spent%20a%20surprising%20amount%20of%20intellectual%20energy%20opposing%20what%20now%20seems%20to%20us%20an%20obvious%20chimera%E2%80%94a%20plan%20to%20resettle%20ex-slaves%20outside%20the%20United%20States%2C%20in%20Central%20America%20or%20the%20West%20Indies%20or%20Africa.%20Though%20Lincoln%20sometimes%20seemed%20sympathetic%20to%20this%20idea%2C%20%E2%80%9Ccolonization%E2%80%9D%20was%20always%20unrealistic.%20But%20it%20wasn%E2%80%99t%20inherently%20a%20racist%20scheme%2C%20and%20not%20a%20few%20black%20leaders%2C%20including%20the%20great%20abolitionist%20Martin%C2%A0R.%20Delany%2C%20advocated%20what%20was%2C%20in%20effect%2C%20a%20form%20of%20black%20Zionism.%20Why%2C%20then%2C%20did%20Douglass%20think%20it%20so%20important%20to%20battle%3F%20It%20was%20because%20Douglass%20saw%20culture%20and%20civilization%20almost%20entirely%20in%20what%20we%20now%20call%20Eurocentric%20terms.%20He%20took%20his%20language%20and%20his%20lore%20and%20his%20moral%20categories%20from%20the%20Bible%2C%20Shakespeare%2C%20Milton%2C%20Scott.%20He%20did%20not%20see%20these%20as%20the%20alien%20property%20of%20white%20people.%20He%20thought%20they%20were%20his%2C%20to%20own%20and%20to%20alter.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EDouglass%E2%80%99s%20relationship%20with%20Lincoln%20throughout%20the%20war%20has%20been%20beautifully%20detailed%20in%20%E2%80%9C%3Ca%20href%3D%5C%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FGiants-Parallel-Frederick-Douglass-Abraham-ebook%2Fdp%2FB001IZC3TM%2Fref%3Dsr_1_1%3Fie%3DUTF8%26amp%3Bqid%3D1539006844%26amp%3Bsr%3D8-1%26amp%3Bkeywords%3DGiants%2Bstauffer%5C%22%3EGiants%3C%2Fa%3E%E2%80%9D%20(2008)%2C%20another%20book%20by%20John%20Stauffer%2C%20and%20Blight%20largely%20follows%20the%20same%20outlines%20of%20the%

consensus can shift with enormous rapidity. Not so very long ago, it was acceptable to cast the American Civil War as a tragic clash between two decent sides. In ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/Ken%20Burns"},"Ken Burns"],"’s 1990 PBS series on the war, Shelby Foote declared, speaking through his soft beard with his gentle drawl, that the problem was that the North and the South somehow couldn’t find a compromise. It has since become harder to deny the truth that slavery was the sole cause of the war. What made war inevitable, then, was the election of President Lincoln, a single-issue candidate who had made his name by calling for an end to slavery’s extension and by recognizing it as an absolute evil. The one conceivable compromise that might have been tried was a gradual program of subsidized emancipation, but, as Lincoln discovered from his correspondence in early 1861 with Alexander Stephens, the eventual Vice-President of the Confederacy, the Southern ruling class had made up its mind: slavery or secession."],["p","While slavery was the war’s sole cause, however, it was not the war’s sole or even its most important rallying cry. To the antislavery cause was added the pro-Union cause, a narrowly nationalist crusade. This aspect of the President’s war-making is why Edmund Wilson impatiently compared Lincoln to Bismarck—both seen as iron-hearted nationalists who taught their people to die for the idea of national greatness. And there’s no doubt that “We won’t let you Rebs walk away with our one country!” was a more motivating cry at Gettysburg than “You must never again keep slaves!”"],["p","Douglass came to see that Lincoln had wrapped the right cause around the wrong cry. The ingenuity of the Gettysburg Address as a forensic argument lies in the way it made the two causes—nationalism and emancipation—seem one. The nation was born in the view that all men are created equal; slavery denies that view; if we lose the war, it shows the world that a nation with that premise cannot survive unfragmented; and therefore fighting for the Union is the same thing as fighting for its first principles. Douglass admired the somewhat sophistic logic."],["p","During the war years, he spent a surprising amount of intellectual energy opposing what now seems to us an obvious chimera—a plan to resettle ex-slaves outside the United States, in Central America or the West Indies or Africa. Though Lincoln sometimes seemed sympathetic to this idea, “colonization” was always unrealistic. But it wasn’t inherently a racist scheme, and not a few black leaders, including the great abolitionist Martin R. Delany, advocated what was, in effect, a form of black Zionism. Why, then, did Douglass think it so important to battle? It was because Douglass saw culture and civilization almost entirely in what we now call Eurocentric terms. He took his language and his lore and his moral categories from the Bible, Shakespeare, Milton, Scott. He did not see these as the alien property of white people. He thought they were his, to own and to alter."],["p","Douglass’s relationship with Lincoln throughout the war has been beautifully detailed in “",["a",{"href":"https://www.amazon.com/Giants-Parallel-Frederick-Douglass-Abraham-ebook/dp/B001IZC3TM/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1539006844&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=Giants+stauffer"},"Giants"],"” (2008), another book by John Stauffer, and Blight largely follows the same outlines of the dance between crusader and politician. Douglass was at first impatient and mistrustful of Lincoln, became somewhat more empathetic concerning his political struggles, and ended being a full-hearted admirer, enthralled by the intended scope of emancipation.

On the one hand, our feminist principles want to make of Assing a model European woman of mind, a suitable intellectual partner for Douglass, a Harriet Taylor to his John Stuart Mill—which indeed she was, broadening his knowledge of, among other things, German poetry and philosophy. At the same time, the characterization feels unkind toward Anna Douglass, who had taken unimaginable risks in order to help Frederick escape slavery. Though Blight is cautious about drawing firm conclusions, it seems clear that Douglass and Assing had an erotic relationship. She wrote to her sister about how happy she was, even though the “external situation remains less than perfect”; and she wrote also of how it feels “when one stands in such intimate relation with one man, as is the case with me in relation to Douglass.” When, later, she went back to Europe, she had his letters burned, and eventually committed suicide by cyanide, at least in part from loneliness."],["p","She brought poetry into his life in every sense—with the reading she shared but also through the rich fantasy she created in which they would start a free, itinerant life together in Europe. As Blight writes, “Ottilie almost never gave up on her quest of drawing Douglass off to a new life in Europe; like spring itself, it was her annual recurring fantasy.” This plan never seems to have existed at more than the level of fantasy—but then the level of fantasy is one of the most important levels at which things can exist. Elsewhere, she compared herself to another Ottilie, in a Goethe novel, who, Blight notes, “finds a tragic fate due to a form of spiritual adultery.” We can overlook how exhausting commitment to a great cause can be, and Douglass had become bound to his.

political life after the war’s end and Lincoln’s assassination may seem anticlimactic, and yet in many respects it is as important as what preceded it. He became, in one view, a conventional party politician. But there is a more positive way to see this migration from militancy. Stauffer’s “Giants” showed us how much Douglass’s prophetic force poked and prodded Lincoln toward righteousness, but Douglass himself was deeply affected by Lincoln’s example of the power of liberal party politics to make real change happen. He became a proud pillar of the Republican Party—essentially, the same baggy assemblage of minorities and progressives and city people (and neoliberals) that we find in the Democratic Party today. Even as Reconstruction failed and ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/Jim%20Crow"},"Jim Crow"]," overtook the South—a reality that Douglass spoke up against as passionately as he had spoken up against slavery—he devoted most of his time to the construction of black institutions. He helped build colleges; there was also a Freedman’s Savings Bank, which, sadly, failed after he had agreed to run it. He received (to the dismay of many black contemporaries) a patronage post, as the U.S. Marshal of Washington, D.C., and was not above passing along a bit of juice to friends and family."],["p","Blight has certainly written, in the book’s texture and density and narrative flow—one violent and provocative incident arriving right after another—a great American biography. But when it comes to the postwar Douglass he perhaps succumbs to a moral anxiety that seems endemic in American academia, taking an ambivalent tone about Douglass’s seemingly more conventional postwar path, and about aspects of Douglass’s engagement with other kinds of liberation movements."],["p","This is particularly true of his engagement with women’s suffrage. We would have liked the struggles against the subjugation of women and of blacks to swim along in tandem. And to some degree they did. Douglass was one of the few men present at Seneca Falls in 1848, when Elizabeth Cady Stanton helped launch the modern American feminist movement. “The history of the world has given to us many sublime undertakings, but none more sublime than this,” he said later. “It was a great thing for humane people to organize in opposition to slavery; but it was a much greater thing, in view of all the circumstances, for woman to organize herself in opposition to her exclusion from participation in government.” (A greater thing, he thought, because it was less self-evidently cruel and more insidiously oppressive.) But, as the war ended and the eighteen-sixties progressed, there were deep differences between them, which, by our standards, were flattering to neither."],["p","Douglass insisted that the Fifteenth Amendment and other protections of black suffrage were essential, even if they excluded women. In 1866, he wrote that, with women, “it is a desirable matter; with us it is important; a question of life and death,” and he made reference to recent massacres of unprotected “free” blacks in New Orleans and Memphis. Later in the decade, he insisted, “When women, because they are women . . . are dragged from their houses and are hung from lamp-posts; when their children are torn from their arms, and their brains bashed out upon the pavement . . . then they will have an urgency to obtain the ballot equal to our own.” Northern middle-class white women, in this view, were free riders on the black man’s struggle for liberation, with incomparably lower risks. Their “husbands, fathers, and brothers” could already protect them. (Intersectionality having not yet arrived, neither Douglass nor the white suffragists talked much about the special predicament of black women.)"],["p","Stanton, like her fellow-campaigner Susan B. Anthony, thought that Douglass failed to grasp that they were not a minority seeking protection by the ballot but a majority forever excluded from any exercise of political power, and declared that a government with the participation of black men as well as white men would merely “multiply the tyrants.” They were incensed by the condescension they detected in him. And both Douglass and Stanton felt free to use the Drunken Pat argument, asking why the feckless, inebriated Irish immigrant had the vote when—depending on who was arguing—black men or white women didn’t. None of it is to our taste: Douglass insulted women, Stanton insulted blacks, and both felt free to insult the Irish."],["p","Yet we need to be charitable about the moral failings of our ancestors—not as an act of charity to them but as an act of charity to ourselves. Our own unconscious assumptions and cultural habits are doubtless just as impregnated with bias as theirs were. We should be kind to them, as we ask the future to be kind to us. To take a small example from this biography: Blight celebrates Douglass’s escape from the South to the whaling town of New Bedford, where he first came into contact with the broader abolitionist circles. He doesn’t mention the fascinating figures of the black whaling captains, whaling being one of the rare professions in pre-Civil War life where black men were sometimes trusted in positions of command. But the whalers participated in acts of unimaginable cruelty inflicted on creatures capable of feeling pain and fear—and future generations might well become as intolerant of cruelty to animals as we are of cruelty to people. As for the ethnic joking that pains Blight, it was an assertion of Americanness: no longer an outsider, Douglass could make after-dinner jokes about the Irish, right along with the rest of his countrymen.

of the last two decades of Douglass’s long life, before his death, in 1895, was spent on a kind of permanent victory tour, receiving honors while exasperating younger black leaders who, in the time-honored tradition, thought that the grand old man was far too grand and far too old to do the necessary work. But he never became morally inert. In 1877, Douglass sought out Thomas Auld, who was dying, to forgive him. “Frederick,” Auld said, “I always knew you were too smart to be a slave, and had I been in your place, I should have done as you did.” “I did not run away from you,” Douglass replied. “I ran away from slavery.”"],["p","That the distinction seems less clear to us—what was Auld but the living face of slavery?—than it did to Douglass is a sign of the complexity of the relationship, and also of the power of the Christian doctrine of forgiveness to penetrate a sensitive mind. For Douglass identified himself as a Christian throughout his life, and his gesture reminds us that slaves absorbed and reimagined the religion of their oppressors in their own morally original terms, as a permanent bulwark against persecution. Even during the reign of white terror that replaced the plantation concentration camps, the black church became the chief reservoir of social capital, and remained so right through Dr. King’s time—one more way in which Douglass’s life encompassed so much of what was to come."],["p","In the end, Douglass fascinates us because he embodies all the contradictions of the black experience in America. A case can be made for him as the progenitor of the pragmatic-progressive strain that leads to Dr. King and, even more, to Bayard Rustin and Obama—disabused of illusions, but insistent that with time the Constitution can be realized in its fullness and that democratic politics are the way to do it. This Douglass is the friend of Lincoln, the man who sustained the necessary relations with institutional power—as Dr. King would do, however guardedly, with Kennedy and then with Johnson. Douglass understood that African-Americans were too small a minority to act without allies. A related pragmatism, prominent in his later writings, became the model of “self-reliance” of the kind that inspires one conservative strain of African-American thought, from Booker T. Washington to ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/clarence-thomas"},"Clarence Thomas"],"."],["p","Yet Douglass can also be seen as the father of the most militant strain of resistance, the kind that insists on the uncompromising rejection of racism, with violence as a recourse when necessary. His confrontation with the brutal slave-breaker Covey is still a model of “manhood,” of self-assertion in defiance of death. Lincoln remains the saint of American democracy, yet his ascent from the backwoods to the White House was, for all its rigors, a far easier ride. Lincoln read in the midst of farming chores; Douglass learned to read at the risk of his life. He had farther to go, and went wider in getting there. Such are the multitudes he contains; he is far from a nineteenth-century figure alone. In his legacy as prophetic radical and political pragmatist, in the almost unimaginable bravery of his early journey and the resilience of his later career, in his achievements as a writer, activist, crusader, intellectual, father, and man, the claim that he was the greatest figure that America has ever produced seems hard to challenge. ♦"]]],"canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"sections":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"},"slug":"magazine","children":[{"id":"592e2a57980e951c27678628","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"592e2a57980e951c27678628","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"A Critic at Large","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"a-critic-at-large"},{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"},{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"}],"name":"A Critic at Large","parent":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"},"slug":"a-critic-at-large"}]}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"magazine","contentTags":[],"contentType":"article","contributors":[{"name":"Adam Gopnik","type":"author","title":"Adam Gopnik, a staff writer, has been contributing to \u003cem&gt;The New Yorker\u003c/em&gt; since 1986.

The evening’s topic, according to a flyer, was “The invisible hand of the super ",["em",{"class":"small"},"PAC"],".” The explainer was ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/zephyr-teachouts-loss-and-the-fight-against-dark-money"},"Zephyr Teachout"],", who was identified as an anti-corruption activist and a “veteran candidate”—a polite way of saying that she ran for governor of New York, in 2014; for Congress, in 2016; and for state ",["a",{"href":"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/03/nyregion/zephyr-teachout-is-running-for-attorney-general-but-her-real-target-is-trump.html"},"attorney general"],", this year, all without enduring the potentially corrupting effects of winning."],["p","Teachout, a law professor at Fordham, is an expert on antitrust issues and on the Constitution’s emoluments clause. She sat on a tall chair before a music stand, straight-backed and unignorably pregnant. “I’m supposed to give birth sometime in the next two weeks, so we’ll see what happens tonight,” she said. “Riding the M.T.A. is very exciting these days. I just have to hope that there’s a midwife on board.”"],["p","Before getting to super ",["em",{"class":"small"},"PAC"],"s, she said, “we’re going to start with Demosthenes.” She began her political history lesson not in 2016, or even in 1776, but in Athens in 351 B.C. A blustering Macedonian tyrant had invaded Greece; Demosthenes, a statesman, urged his countrymen to stop their hand-wringing and start organizing. “Observe, Athenians, the height to which the fellow’s insolence has soared,” Teachout said, reading from Demosthenes’ speech. “He is always taking in more, everywhere casting his net round us, while we sit idle and do nothing.” Lifting her eyes, she made sure that the metaphor was landing. “We’re in a genuinely unstable moment in our politics right now,” she told the audience. “Six weeks ago, lots of people would have told you that the Kavanaugh nomination was a foregone conclusion. So, whenever you hear punditry, remember how unstable history is.”"],["p","The night before, Teachout had e-mailed the people who’d R.S.V.P.’d for the event with a homework assignment. “Facebook and Google are essentially an advertising duopoly, and we have almost no idea how their algorithms work,” she said. But, she went on, Facebook recently built a small island of transparency called the Ad Archive—a database of all political ads on the platform, along with information about who had paid for them. Teachout had asked attendees to conduct a few searches. “Did anyone do the assignment?” she asked."],["p","“I don’t use Facebook,” a young man wearing gold sneakers said."],["p","“I deleted my account,” a middle-aged man said. “Millions of us did, because of ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/cambridge-analytica"},"Cambridge Analytica"]," and other security scandals.”"],["p","“",["em","Disgracebook"],",” a man in the second row said. “That’s what I call it. You can use that one if you want.”"],["p","Teachout laughed. “Well, this is an unrepresentative sample,” she said. “Let’s just take it as a current social fact that people do use Facebook. What does it mean that many of the messages they receive about their candidates are not coming from the candidates themselves?”"],["p","“I never pay attention to a candidate’s ads, no matter who’s paying for them,” a woman with glasses said. “I only pay attention to what they say in debates, when they’re under pressure, or on ‘Brian Lehrer,’ who is a saint.” She added, “We don’t have a national Brian Lehrer, but maybe we need one.”"],["inline-embed",{"type":"callout","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22callout%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22inset-left%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22cartoon%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522cartoon%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%2522%252Fcartoon%252F5bb810768688f82d6d667e27%2522%252C%2522width%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522height%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522caption%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%225bb810768688f82d6d667e27%5C%22%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%22%2C%22attrs%22%3A%7B%7D%7D","ref":""},["inline-embed",{"type":"cartoon","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22cartoon%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22%2Fcartoon%2F5bb810768688f82d6d667e27%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":"5bb810768688f82d6d667e27"}]],["p","“What you’re asking for is some form of mediated information,” Teachout said. “If you can learn without ads, you’re going to learn a lot better.

Teachout emphasized the growing influence of corporate money in U.S. elections but tried to end on a hopeful note. “I am not Pollyannaish about the depths of the challenges we face,” she said; still, she argued that change is possible. “The work of being a citizen is hard and annoying, but it can pay off.” She recited another quote: “ ‘Impossible’ is just a big word thrown around by small men.”"],["p","“Who said that?” she asked."],["p","“Demosthenes?”"],["p","“Teddy Roosevelt?”"],["p","“Muhammad Ali,” Teachout told the room.

a stormy night in 1987, an American herpetologist named Marty Crump was getting ready for bed when she heard a tapping at her door. This was in the mountains of northwest Costa Rica, where evening callers were rare. The visitor had braved the downpour to give Crump what counted, in field-biology circles, as a hot tip: the golden toads had emerged."],["p","Golden toads had been formally described only two decades earlier, by another American herpetologist, named Jay Savage. In the paper Savage had written assigning the species its Latin name—",["em","Bufo periglenes"],"—he noted that the toads exhibited “the most startling coloration.”"],["p","“I must confess that my initial response when I saw them was one of disbelief,” he wrote in an otherwise staid scientific tract. He wondered briefly whether someone had tricked him by dipping “the examples in enamel paint.”"],["p","Golden toads had been seen only in rugged terrain, near the crest of a mountain range known as the Cordillera de Tilarán, which forms part of the Continental Divide. They seemed to live mostly underground, surfacing only long enough to reproduce, an M.O. that made them difficult to study. The morning after the knock on her door, Crump trekked up the cordillera, through a soup of fog, mud, and drizzle. When she finally spotted the golden toads, she was so astonished that she forgot how miserable she felt. The toads, she later wrote, were “dazzling,” like jewels scattered on the forest floor."],["p","That spring, Crump watched golden toads mate, a process that sometimes took as long as twenty-five hours. Males outnumbered females by as much as ten to one, and when a guy managed to find a single lady he would tackle her from behind. Carrying him piggyback, she would hop to the nearest puddle, while he fended off competitors. Sometimes so many males were trying to crawl on top of the same female that they formed an orange ball, studded with writhing orange limbs."],["p","Crump returned to Costa Rica the following May to continue her research on golden-toad reproduction. By the end of July, she had spotted just one toad at the site where, the previous year, she’d seen dozens."],["p","In 1989, Crump arrived in Costa Rica in early April. She hiked up the mountain: no toads. She made the trip again—same result. After a month, a family emergency compelled her to return home to Florida, and one of her graduate students took over. He eventually found a lone toad, a male. Crump spent 1990 on sabbatical in Argentina. A colleague monitored her research site and was to alert her if any toads appeared. None did."],["p","By 1990, it was no secret that many populations of wild animals were in trouble. Still, Crump’s experience represented something new under the cloud cover. A biologist could now choose a species to study and watch it disappear, all within the course of a few field seasons."],["p","Crump chronicled the loss of the golden toad in a book titled, for complicated reasons, “",["a",{"href":"https://www.amazon.com/Search-Golden-Frog-Marty-Crump/dp/0226121984/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1539007291&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=In+Search+of+the+Golden+Frog"},"In Search of the Golden Frog"],".” (The golden frog, which is native to Panama, is only very distantly related to the golden toad. Neon yellow in color, it, too, has vanished from the rain forest.) She followed this with a second book, “",["a",{"href":"https://www.amazon.com/Extinction-Our-Times-Amphibian-Decline-ebook/dp/B005YMCBRO/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1539007320&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=Extinction+in+Our+Times"},"Extinction in Our Times"],",” co-written with a colleague.

Six weeks of intensive monitoring failed to turn up a single baiji. When the survey results were made public, in the journal ",["em","Biology Letters,"]," Turvey was deluged with interview requests.

He first visited the polar north in 1970, when, as an undergraduate, he got a job on a Canadian research vessel, the Hudson, which was attempting to circumnavigate the Americas. Although the Hudson was built for travel through sea ice, on the last leg of the journey it got stuck in the Northwest Passage and had to be rescued by an icebreaker. Evidently, Wadhams enjoyed the experience—in the stiff-upper-lip tradition of British adventurers, he’s largely mum on the topic of emotion—because he returned to northern Canada a few years later to work on his Ph.D. This involved flying over the ice cap in a sort of aeronautical jalopy—a Second World War-era DC-4 with the cockpit bubble of a Sabre fighter jet welded to the fuselage. The flights left from Gander, and Wadhams recalls a bar in town, called the Flyers’ Club, where a band played topless."],["p","At the time, Wadhams imagined himself part of a glaciological tradition stretching back to the Napoleonic Wars. The idea was to map the extent of the Arctic sea ice and then, basically, forget about it. (Many died trying.) The ice cap’s size varied, expanding in winter, when the polar darkness descended, and then contracting in summer. But this cycle, like the seasons themselves, was supposed to be unchanging. The assumption, Wadhams writes, was that “everything in the ocean is constant.”"],["p","In the nineteen-eighties, satellites replaced scientists eyeballing the Arctic from DC-4s. The satellite data revealed that the ice was shrinking. By this point, the earliest climate models had been assembled, using I.B.M. punch cards, and they predicted that global warming would be felt first and foremost at the poles. In 1990, Wadhams compared surveys of the sea ice north of Greenland that had been conducted from British submarines, using upward-looking sonar. The comparison showed that the ice cap, in addition to contracting, was thinning; during the previous decade, its thickness had declined by fifteen per cent."],["p","By the end of the summer of 2007, the ice cap was about half the size it had been at the start of the satellite era, and the Arctic sea ice had entered what an American scientist, Mark Serreze, has dubbed its “death spiral.” Today, a decade deeper into the spiral, older Arctic sea ice has mostly melted away. What’s left, in large part, is first-year ice, which forms over the winter and, since it’s thinner, is that much more prone to melt the following spring. The most recent climate models predict that within a few decades the Arctic Ocean will be entirely ice-free in summer. Based on his own observations, Wadhams believes that the time frame is more like the next few years. “It is clear that the summer Arctic sea ice does not have long to live,” he writes."],["p","For his part, Serreze, who directs the National Snow and Ice Data Center, housed at the University of Colorado Boulder, has also written a farewell to ice. In “",["a",{"href":"https://www.amazon.com/Brave-New-Arctic-Melting-Essentials/dp/0691173990/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1539007430&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=Brave+New+Arctic%3A+The+Untold+Story+of+the+Melting+North"},"Brave New Arctic: The Untold Story of the Melting North"],"” (Princeton), he relates that when he first started out in polar research, in the early eighties, he was taken with the idea of global cooling. “Deep down I was hoping for an ice age,” he confesses."],["p","As the satellite and sonar images began to pile up, Serreze continued to hold out that hope. Perhaps, he theorized, the ice cap was shrinking due to a natural cycle that would eventually reverse. Years passed, the ice continued to melt, and Serreze came to favor fire. “The weight of evidence turned me,” he observes. “And then I turned hard.” He gives the perennial sea ice until 2030 or so. “That the Arctic Ocean will become free of sea ice in late summer and early autumn is a given,” he writes."],["p","Both Wadhams and Serreze anticipate the loss will have disastrous and, as it were, snowballing consequences. Sea ice reflects sunlight, while open water absorbs it, so melting ice leads to further warming, which leads to more melt, and so on. (This past winter, parts of the Arctic saw temperatures of up to forty-five degrees above normal, even as parts of the United States and Europe were being buried under snow; some scientists believe the two phenomena are related, though others note that the link is, at this point, unproved.) Arctic soils contain hundreds of billions of tons of carbon, in the form of frozen and only partially decomposed plants. As the region heats up, much of this carbon is likely to be released into the atmosphere, where it will trap more heat—another feedback loop. In the Arctic Ocean, vast stores of methane lie buried under frozen sediments.

known as a “global bleaching event” occurs when coral reefs in three oceans—the Atlantic, the Pacific, and the Indian—exhibit signs of heat stress all at the same time. There was a global bleaching event in 1998, and a second one in 2010. In October, 2015, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced that another event was beginning. The bleaching continued through 2016, and then on through the first half of 2017. By the time it ended, in June of last year, almost a third of the shallow-water corals on the Great Barrier Reef were dead. In the northern stretches of the reef, the mortality rate was closer to three-quarters."],["p","As it happens, shortly before ",["em",{"class":"small"},"NOAA"],"’s announcement, Irus Braverman, a professor of law and geography at the University at Buffalo, set out to interview coral biologists. The earlier global bleaching events, combined with various other forms of destruction—disease, dredging, dynamite fishing—had already convinced marine scientists that reefs were in grave trouble. Still, as Braverman relates in her forthcoming book “",["a",{"href":"https://www.amazon.com/Coral-Whisperers-Scientists-Critical-Environments/dp/0520298853/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1539007451&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=Coral+Whisperers%3A+Scientists+on+the+Brink"},"Coral Whisperers: Scientists on the Brink"],"” (University of California), even the gloomiest were caught off guard by the third event. After taking an aerial survey of the Great Barrier Reef, one of Australia’s most prominent coral biologists, Terry Hughes, showed the results to his students. “And then we wept,” he tweeted."],["p","An American scientist, Laurie Raymundo, reported on Facebook that, after observing the devastation of reefs in Tumon Bay, on Guam’s west coast, “for the first time in the fifty years I’ve been in the water, I cried for an hour, right into my mask.”"],["p","Coral reefs are often referred to as living structures; as such, they span the divide between the faunal and the geological. Individual corals are tiny, gelatinous animals infelicitously referred to as polyps. In their cells, polyps house even tinier algae, which they rely on for food, to help fuel their extraordinary building projects. Bleaching occurs when water temperatures rise more than two degrees or so above normal. For reasons that are not entirely understood, corals react to the heat by expelling their symbionts. (Alternatively, according to some scientists, it’s the algae that respond by decamping.) If the bleaching event is short-lived, the corals can survive and, eventually, recover. But in a warming world, where such events are becoming both more frequent and more protracted, the prognosis for reefs is much the same as it is for sea ice."],["p","A coral ecologist named Peter Sale, who’s a professor emeritus at Ontario’s University of Windsor, tells Braverman that reef scientists are confronting “the likely disappearance of the ecosystem they have been studying.” What most interests Braverman, though, is not the fate of reefs—with Sale, she takes their disappearance as likely—but the way scientists choose to “narrate” the crisis. She finds them divided into two camps. In one are those who argue that reefs’ downward spiral can be arrested only by dealing with climate change, which is to say, by completely revamping the world’s energy systems. (It’s worth pointing out that, if Wadhams and Serreze are right about Arctic feedbacks, even this may not be enough.)"],["p","“A lot of what we’re doing in terms of conservation actions is futile until we stabilize the climate,” Ove Hoegh-Guldberg, the director of the Global Change Institute, at Australia’s University of Queensland, tells Braverman. Hoegh-Guldberg describes local efforts to preserve or restore reefs as “rearranging the chairs on the Titanic to get a better view.” Imitating those on the other side, he says, “Let’s just block out those horrible people, like me, who say it’s all futile. ‘Lalalalalala, can’t hear you!’ ”"],["p","In the second camp are those who argue that, yes, reefs are dying and, yes, the situation is only going to get worse, but this just makes local restoration efforts that much more urgent. Ruth Gates, the director of the Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology, is working on selectively breeding corals that might be able to withstand higher temperatures, an approach that’s become known as “assisted evolution.”"],["p","“The gloom and doom is paralyzing,” she tells Braverman at one point. “The scope of climate change is paralyzing.”"],["p","“I don’t know what the outcome of our project will be,” Gates says at another point. But, on some level, “we’re already successful. Because we’re sending out a more hopeful message, something we can do actively.”"],["p","Hope and its doleful twin, Hopelessness, might be thought of as the co-muses of the modern eco-narrative. Such is the world we’ve created—a world of wounds—that loss is, almost invariably, the nature writer’s subject. The question is how we relate to that loss. Is the glass ninety-five per cent empty or is it five per cent full?"],["p","The message that there’s still “something we can do actively” has a lot to be said for it. It offers a rationale for not giving up—on species, on whole ecosystems—which is also a rationale for continuing to research these subjects and, perhaps most relevant for scientists turned authors, for continuing to write about them. Narrating the disaster becomes a way to try to avert it. Wadhams ends “A Farewell to Ice” with a chapter titled “A Call to Arms.” In it, he urges readers to “adopt every possible measure that will reduce unnecessary energy use,” to lobby for better laws, and to embrace nuclear power, which, he writes, “will keep the lights on without carbon emission.”"],["p","But we seem to have reached the point where even the calls to arms are starting to sound like dirges. In the same chapter in which Wadhams argues for better energy policies, he observes that such policies probably can’t—and almost certainly won’t—be put in place fast enough to save the Arctic. Therefore, he says, technologies to block sunlight or change the reflectivity of clouds will have to be deployed. These so-called geoengineering technologies have yet to be tested—if truth be told, they’ve really yet to be invented—but without them, according to Wadhams, the “temperature rise, and the associated further feedbacks, will be too great to allow our civilization to continue.” Apparently, this is supposed to count as inspirational."],["p","It’s hard to say what purpose would be served by a message of straight-up despair; despondency, as it’s often noted, produces its own feedback loop. And yet, scientifically speaking, what alternative is there, as we move into the future, beyond the baiji, and the golden toad, and the reefs, and the sea ice, on toward reëngineering the atmosphere?

most bitter ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/supreme-court"},"Supreme Court"]," confirmation in decades came to an effective end just after 3 ",["em",{"class":"small"},"p.m."]," last Friday, when Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, took to the Senate floor to announce that she would vote in favor of Judge ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/brett-kavanaugh"},"Brett Kavanaugh"],". In a long, detailed address, she spoke about a “gutter level” political fight, and said that the President has “broad discretion” in nominating whom he wants. She herself seemed to want nothing more than to be done with the events that had drawn the country into a melee of rage and sorrow. All week, protesters had been assembling at her office, telling her that she needed to do more than just stand by the Republican Party."],["p","In this, Collins’s actions recalled a distinction made by Christine Blasey Ford, who said that Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted her some thirty-six years ago. Rachel Mitchell, a criminal prosecutor brought in by the Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee to question Ford, asked her to review a WhatsApp message that she had sent to the ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/washington-post"},"Washington"]," ",["em",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/washington-post"},"Post"],"."]," Ford worried that she had misused the word “bystander” to describe P.J., a boy who, in her recollection, had been one of the teen-agers in the house where the assault took place. “ ‘Bystander’ means someone that is looking,” Ford said. The assault had taken place in an upstairs bedroom, she noted, and P.J. “had been downstairs.” (She added, “What I remember of him was he was a tall and very nice person.”) The word “bystander” used to be automatically paired with the word “innocent”; for better and for worse, it has lost its air of exoneration, which is, presumably, why Ford wanted to be clear about the boy who stayed downstairs."],["p","Who is a bystander—or a corroborator, or a collaborator, or a witness—and what such a person ought to do, know, recognize, or remember, became key questions in the wrenching discussions that have taken place since Ford’s story became public, a month ago, followed by allegations from Deborah Ramirez, one of Kavanaugh’s ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/yale-university"},"Yale"]," classmates, that he exposed himself to her at a drunken gathering during their freshman year. (Ramirez acknowledged that her memories were fragmented. Kavanaugh has strongly denied all the charges.) Part of the issue is that assessments of a six-day ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/federal-bureau-of-investigation"},"F.B.I."]," investigation that Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, had dramatically forced his party to agree to, turned on whether the agents had interviewed everyone they should have. They spoke to P.J. and to the men memorialized in Kavanaugh’s 1982 calendar as Timmy and Squi, along with Mark Judge, whom Ford says watched Kavanaugh pin her down and try to undress her. Leland Keyser, a friend of Ford’s who does not remember being at such a party but has expressed her faith in Ford’s account, was also interviewed. A number of Yale classmates who offered portrayals of Kavanaugh as a belligerent drinker, and without whom, Democrats argued, the investigation was incomplete, were not. Neither were Blasey and Kavanaugh."],["p","Meanwhile, people on both sides, armed with online floor plans and real-estate-site photos, wandered through homes that they imagined may have been the location of the gathering, which Ford could not pinpoint, digging up property records and foreclosure filings. In some cases, these were earnest efforts to fill in gaps in the story; as Mitchell noted, in a memo that Republicans seized on, Ford had placed the date of the assault in the early eighties, the mid-eighties, and just the eighties, before tentatively narrowing it down to the summer of 1982. But there was also, at times, an indifference to invasions of privacy, or intrusions into private pain."],["p","The problem of bystanderdom here goes well beyond the sexual-assault allegations against Kavanaugh. It was on display during the first part of his hearings, when Republican senators, in the interest of getting a conservative nominee confirmed, discounted the apparent lies that he told about his role in Bush-era torture and detention policies and in judicial nominations. And it extends to their decision to tolerate the excesses of ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump"},"Donald Trump"],", in return for his promise to nominate a conservative. When you decide to countenance demagoguery, one step leads to another. Last week, the Republicans had to put up with the President goading a crowd at a rally in Mississippi to laugh at Ford. Some of Kavanaugh’s supporters worried that this would make it harder for late-deciding Republicans to vote yes. In fact, Trump made the process more humiliating, not only for them but for the entire Republican Party."],["p","In the Senate, the few voices left in the middle—in this case, those included the Democrats Joe Manchin, of West Virginia, and Heidi Heitkamp, of North Dakota—have rarely been so marginalized. Yet they were treated almost as the only actors who mattered, even though any two or three Republicans could have chosen to swing the vote against Kavanaugh. When Heitkamp announced, last Thursday, that she would vote no, she conceded that it might hurt her reëlection chances in November; in 2016, Trump won North Dakota with sixty-three per cent of the vote. But she spoke of the vote as if it had forced her to bear witness to her own past: “I can’t get up in the morning and look at the life experience I’ve had and say yes.” Manchin, who is also up for reëlection, in a state that Trump won with almost seventy per cent of the vote, made a different calculation: on Friday, he said that he was a yes. ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/lisa-murkowski"},"Lisa Murkowski"],", of Alaska, was the only Republican to say that she would not support Kavanaugh."],["p","In contrast, the majority of the senators who had made their choice clear weeks ago were allowed to move, unperturbed, toward what was one of the most momentous votes of their careers. They made speeches if it was opportune, but not much else was expected of them, other than party loyalty. Mike Lee, of Utah, said that the process had “been exhaustive.” In terms of the consequences for the midterms, it may have just begun."],["p","Jeff Flake, who is retiring at the end of the year, had made a telling comment on this point a few days earlier. Scott Pelley, of “60 Minutes,” asked him if he would have been willing to call for the postponement of the vote if he were running for reëlection. “No, not a chance,” he said. “There’s no value to reaching across the aisle. There’s no currency for that anymore.” Then where is the currency? Flake made the Senate sound like a casino, decorated with a gilded sign reading “",["em",{"class":"small"},"TRUMP"],".” Yet, on Friday, he said that he would vote for Kavanaugh, after all. These days, in Washington, there are no bystanders, no senators who can ignore their role in the Kavanaugh fight, or how many Americans it may hurt, and for how long. ♦"]]],"canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"sections":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"},"slug":"magazine","children":[{"id":"592dfa44d5fda942c34a0b61","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"592dfa44d5fda942c34a0b61","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Comment","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"comment"},{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"},{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"}],"name":"Comment","parent":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"},"slug":"comment"}]}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"magazine","contentTags":[{"name":"Brett Kavanaugh","url":"/tag/brett-kavanaugh"},{"name":"Supreme Court","url":"/tag/supreme-court"},{"name":"Confirmation Hearings","url":"/tag/confirmation-hearings"},{"name":"Women","url":"/tag/women"},{"name":"#MeToo","url":"/tag/metoo"},{"name":"Republican Party","url":"/tag/republican-party"}],"contentType":"article","contributors":[{"name":"Amy Davidson Sorkin","type":"author","title":"Amy Davidson Sorkin, a \u003cem&gt;New Yorker\u003c/em&gt; staff writer, is a regular contributor to Comment for the magazine and writes a Web \u003ca href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson\"&gt;column\u003c/a&gt;, in which she covers war, sports, and everything in between.","email":"","bio":["div",["p","Amy Davidson Sorkin became a staff writer in 2014.

Dylan’s songs play a bit of a trick. They loft you along, their verses engaging the brain much the way that plot does in prose: as a long, supple spine making sense of a fleshy body of emotion. And, as happens so often when we speak with almost anyone, we get the impression of being told a story about the outer world while actually learning mostly about the speaker himself. The real Dylan (to my mind, the best Dylan) is the one who presents himself as a national bard, a keeper of myth, but whose music, closely observed, is the extension of a tightly controlled persona."],["p","Listen to “Hurricane,” one of my favorites. The song tells the mostly true story of the black boxer Rubin Carter, who was imprisoned after being wrongfully convicted of a triple murder. Dylan’s storytelling is clear and precise; each verse wraps America’s fingers ever more tightly around Carter’s neck, until the clang of the cell door seems all but inevitable. But the song’s real goods come in the way that Dylan picks up and quickly puts away his protagonists—of whom Carter is decidedly not one. There’s the harried witness to the crime, and the third-string crook who helps with the frame job. Then, toward the end, there’s Dylan:"],["blockquote",["p","How can the life of such a man",["br"],"Be in the palm of some fool’s hand?",["br"],"To see him obviously framed",["br"],"Couldn’t help but make me feel ashamed to live in a land",["br"],"Where justice is a game."]],["p","Those words—especially “see” and “feel”—are the heart of the song. All these eyes on Carter help us see how Jim Crow and civil rights split the white majority into rival identities: the earnest protester, the mercenary, the cop, the seemingly innocent but conveniently confused."],["p","This tension between the narrative at the surface and the psycho-biographical just beneath is on display in the musical “Girl from the North Country,” written and directed by Conor McPherson, which takes its name, and its music, from Dylan’s catalogue. In “Girl”—which, after playing on the West End, in London, is now at the Public—McPherson attempts to surround several of Dylan’s tunes with a frame vague enough to contain their poetry and broad enough to relate their social truths. And so the story is set in Depression-era Duluth, Minnesota—Dylan’s birthplace, in the decade before his birth—but the town could be any hard-luck place north of the Mason-Dixon Line and remote from the coasts."],["p","Nick Laine, played by Stephen Bogardus, is the owner of a boarding house, buried in debt: his grown kids can barely step outside without a message coming back that he owes somebody money. His son, Gene (Colton Ryan), is a would-be writer who can’t find a job but also can’t seem to lose sight of the bottle: his desk is the top of the town bar. His dad acidly calls him Hemingway. Nick’s wife, Elizabeth, played in a livid slapstick by Mare Winningham, has settled into a half-awake state of dementia: she shouts nonsense or shares ecstatic snatches from a quickly fading past, then dispenses eerily lucid judgments. Love or money sufficient to fix even one of these problems never comes."],["p","As in much of Dylan’s work, racial adjacency is a theme. Nick and Elizabeth are white, but their pregnant daughter, Marianne (Kimber Sprawl), is black; she was discovered as an infant, like a Midwestern Moses, in a bag on the boarding-house floor. And Nick is fooling around with a black boarder, Mrs. Neilsen (Jeannette Bayardelle), who stands to come into an inheritance—and plans to whisk poor Nick away from Duluth, and out of debt. One of the most common moves in songbook-style musicals, and in American covers in general, is to interpret something “white” in a “black” way. (The reverse we just call rock and roll.) In applying this formula to Dylan, McPherson and the arranger Simon Hale take part in an intimidating tradition. When Sam Cooke sang “Blowin’ in the Wind” for the genteel audience at the Copacabana, he added his signature gospelized yodel, but also clipped his phrases with all the irony of a lost Rat Pack member, resulting in a song that would sound as natural at the altar as in the night club."],["p","Hale and McPherson’s arrangements, anchored by a group of intricately harmonized background singers (all of whom double as actors) and a small band, try for a similar effect, and sometimes get close. Another way to parse Dylan is to separate his voice—a harsh grasp at the blues—from his melodies and song structures, which speak more directly to Appalachia than to the Delta. The renditions in “Girl” lean almost uniformly blackward, toward a melismatic R. &amp; B., regardless of the race of the singer. You wonder if this is how Dylan sounds to himself in his dreams. Still, the songs sit uneasily next to the story. There’s a wonderful moment when a mysterious former fighter—clearly a shadow of Rubin Carter—leads a foot-stomping version of “Hurricane” shortly after a sudden flexing of his powers. But more often the fragmented plot, offered by a teeming, sketched-out ensemble of woeful souls, seems like a series of vignettes meant to hold you over until the music starts again. “Girl” often feels less like a musical than like a very sorrowful revue."]],["inline-embed",{"type":"section","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22section%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cp%3EBut%20there%20are%20hints%2C%20brought%20by%20actors%2C%20of%20a%20better-integrated%20Dylan%20musical%20to%20come.%20Winningham%2C%20as%20the%20free-associating%20Elizabeth%2C%20is%20impossible%20not%20to%20follow%20as%20she%20stalks%20the%20stage%2C%20caught%20between%20coherence%20and%20the%20void.%20Almost%20every%20line%20she%20utters%20elicits%20a%20laugh%2C%20or%20a%20gasp%2C%20or%20a%20groan%3B%20hers%20is%20not%20only%20the%20most%20impressive%20performance%20in%20%E2%80%9CGirl%20from%20the%20North%20Country%E2%80%9D%20but%20the%20one%20that%20works%20most%20like%20Dylan%E2%80%99s%20best%20songs%E2%80%94action%20and%20feeling%20happen%20simultaneously%2C%20and%20are%20expressed%20by%20way%20of%20the%20very%20same%20gestures.%20Even%20her%20physicality%20is%20suggestively%20dual%3A%20she%20walks%20with%20the%20hunched%20tenderness%20of%20the%20aged%20and%20overburdened%2C%20but%20also%2C%20through%20a%20glance%20or%20a%20gleeful%2C%20violent%20lunge%2C%20shows%20a%20youthfulness%20that%20makes%20you%20wonder%20who%20Elizabeth%20once%20was.%20She%20sings%20%E2%80%9CLike%20a%20Rolling%20Stone%E2%80%9D%20like%20a%20lunatic%20angel%20whose%20message%20comes%20from%20sound%2C%20not%20sense.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EAcross%20the%20love%20triangle%20from%20Elizabeth%20stands%20Bayardelle%E2%80%99s%20Mrs.%20Neilsen%2C%20who%20is%20a%20familiar%20archetype%3A%20the%20sensible%2C%20somewhat%20stoic%20black%20lady%20who%20seems%20to%20understand%20misfortune%20before%20it%20arrives%2C%20and%20is%20hurt%20but%20in%20no%20way%20surprised%20by%20her%20lover%E2%80%99s%20insufficiency.%20She%E2%80%99s%20obviously%20sweet%2C%20though%3A%20at%20one%20point%2C%20she%20offers%20not%20only%20to%20help%20brush%20Elizabeth%E2%80%99s%20teeth%20but%20to%20sing%20as%20she%20does%20it.%20The%20character%E2%80%99s%20depth%20is%20alluded%20to%20in%20that%20oddly%20formal%20name%E2%80%94%E2%80%9CMrs.%E2%80%9D%20hints%20at%20a%20prior%20love%2C%20the%20specifics%20of%20which%20it%20would%20be%20nice%20to%20hear.%20Luckily%2C%20Bayardelle%20brings%20her%20own%20pathos%2C%20through%20line%20delivery%20and%20through%20song%20(she%20sings%20beautifully%2C%20with%20power%20and%20trilling%20restraint)%E2%80%94enough%20to%20trace%20the%20outline%20of%20a%20whole%2C%20intriguing%20life.%20I%20wish%20she%E2%80%99d%20had%20more%20to%20do.%20A%20show%20that%20fully%20accepted%20the%20challenge%20of%20Dylan%E2%80%99s%20elusive%20balance%20between%20unstable%20consciousness%20and%20tough%20social%20fact%20might%20have%20told%20more%20of%20its%20story%20through%20the%20lives%20of%20these%20two%20women%2C%20leaving%20the%20audience%20to%20wade%20through%20the%20haze%20in%20Elizabeth%E2%80%99s%20head%20while%20also%20observing%20events%20more%20concretely%20through%20Mrs.%20Neilsen%E2%80%99s%20cool%20eye.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EA%20different%20setting%20in%20time%20might%20have%20helped%20as%20well.%20I%20understand%20the%20urge%20to%20avoid%20a%20veiled%20Dylan%20biography%20by%20travelling%20back%20to%20a%20point%20before%20he%20came%20on%20the%20scene.%20But%20the%20Depression%20shown%20here%20is%20largely%20schmaltz%2C%20and%20every%20tension%20points%20to%20one%20desiccated%20source%E2%80%94the%20bank.%20What%20makes%20Dylan%20cohere%2C%20not%20only%20as%20a%20writer%20of%20public-private%20anthems%20but%20also%20as%20an%20emblem%20of%20an%20era%2C%20is%20his%20grounding%20amid%20the%20existential%2C%20sexual%2C%20political%2C%20and%20religious%20concerns%20that%20arose%20in%20the%20relatively%20prosperous%20years%20after%20the%20Second%20World%20War.%20McPherson%20offers%20up%20plenty%20of%20people%E2%80%94probably%20too%20many%E2%80%94but%20never%20a%20voice%2C%20or%20a%20mind%2C%20like%20Dylan%E2%80%99s%3A%20the%20kind%20that%20fits%20history%20through%20the%20needle%E2%80%99s%20eye%20of%20the%20self.%C2%A0%E2%99%A6%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%22%7D","ref":""},["p","But there are hints, brought by actors, of a better-integrated Dylan musical to come. Winningham, as the free-associating Elizabeth, is impossible not to follow as she stalks the stage, caught between coherence and the void. Almost every line she utters elicits a laugh, or a gasp, or a groan; hers is not only the most impressive performance in “Girl from the North Country” but the one that works most like Dylan’s best songs—action and feeling happen simultaneously, and are expressed by way of the very same gestures. Even her physicality is suggestively dual: she walks with the hunched tenderness of the aged and overburdened, but also, through a glance or a gleeful, violent lunge, shows a youthfulness that makes you wonder who Elizabeth once was. She sings “Like a Rolling Stone” like a lunatic angel whose message comes from sound, not sense."],["p","Across the love triangle from Elizabeth stands Bayardelle’s Mrs. Neilsen, who is a familiar archetype: the sensible, somewhat stoic black lady who seems to understand misfortune before it arrives, and is hurt but in no way surprised by her lover’s insufficiency. She’s obviously sweet, though: at one point, she offers not only to help brush Elizabeth’s teeth but to sing as she does it. The character’s depth is alluded to in that oddly formal name—“Mrs.” hints at a prior love, the specifics of which it would be nice to hear. Luckily, Bayardelle brings her own pathos, through line delivery and through song (she sings beautifully, with power and trilling restraint)—enough to trace the outline of a whole, intriguing life. I wish she’d had more to do. A show that fully accepted the challenge of Dylan’s elusive balance between unstable consciousness and tough social fact might have told more of its story through the lives of these two women, leaving the audience to wade through the haze in Elizabeth’s head while also observing events more concretely through Mrs. Neilsen’s cool eye."],["p","A different setting in time might have helped as well. I understand the urge to avoid a veiled Dylan biography by travelling back to a point before he came on the scene. But the Depression shown here is largely schmaltz, and every tension points to one desiccated source—the bank. What makes Dylan cohere, not only as a writer of public-private anthems but also as an emblem of an era, is his grounding amid the existential, sexual, political, and religious concerns that arose in the relatively prosperous years after the Second World War. McPherson offers up plenty of people—probably too many—but never a voice, or a mind, like Dylan’s: the kind that fits history through the needle’s eye of the self. ♦"]]],"canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"sections":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"},"slug":"magazine","children":[{"id":"5910aa3ddd6207318b5db99c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5910aa3ddd6207318b5db99c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"The Theatre","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"the-theatre"},{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"},{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"}],"name":"The Theatre","parent":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"},"slug":"the-theatre"}]}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"magazine","contentTags":[],"contentType":"article","contributors":[{"name":"Vinson Cunningham","type":"author","title":"Vinson Cunningham joined The New Yorker as a staff writer in 2016.","email":"","bio":["div",["p","Vinson Cunningham joined ",["em","The New Yorker"]," as a staff writer in 2016.
