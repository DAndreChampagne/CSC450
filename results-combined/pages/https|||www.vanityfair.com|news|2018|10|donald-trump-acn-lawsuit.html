(According to <em>The New York Times,</em> the Trump family <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/10/02/us/politics/donald-trump-tax-schemes-fred-trump.html">created</a> a company in 1992 that not only allowed the family to siphon millions to Trump, his siblings, and a cousin, but also let them pad invoices so they could raise the rent on low-income tenants who were supposed to be protected by rent regulations. In a statement, <strong>Charles Harder,</strong> a lawyer for Trump, told the <em>Times:</em> “There was no fraud or tax evasion by anyone” and that such affairs were “handled by other Trump family members.”) So, really, it shouldn’t come as a surprise in the slightest that the president and his three adult children have been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/29/nyregion/trump-acn-lawsuit.html">accused</a> of pushing investment scams on thousands of vulnerable Americans in exchange for “lavish” payments they conveniently failed to mention in their sales pitches.</p><div data-reactid="229"><blockquote>
<p>Filed in federal court in Manhattan on Monday . . . the 160-page complaint alleges that Mr. Trump and his family received secret payments from three business entities in exchange for promoting them as legitimate opportunities, when in reality they were get-rich-quick schemes that harmed investors, many of whom were unsophisticated and struggling financially.</p>
</blockquote></div><div data-reactid="230"><blockquote>
<p>Those business entities were ACN, a telecommunications marketing company that paid Mr. Trump millions of dollars to endorse its products; the Trump Network, a vitamin marketing enterprise; and the Trump Institute, which the suit said offered “extravagantly priced multiday training seminars” on Mr. Trump’s real estate “secrets.”</p>
</blockquote></div><div data-reactid="231"><blockquote>
<p>The four plaintiffs, who were identified only with pseudonyms like Jane Doe, depict the Trump Organization as a racketeering enterprise that defrauded thousands of people for years as the president turned from construction to licensing his name for profit. The suit also names <strong><a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/people/donald-trump#intcid=dt-hot-link">Donald Trump</a> Jr., <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/people/ivanka-trump#intcid=dt-hot-link">Ivanka Trump</a>,</strong> and <strong>Eric Trump</strong> as defendants.</p>
</blockquote></div><p data-reactid="232">Back in 2011, <em>New York</em>’s <strong>Jessica Pressler</strong> <a href="http://nymag.com/nymag/features/70831/">wrote</a> about the vitamin venture, which included products like “Prime Essentials” and “Custom Essentials,” a line of snacks for kids called “Snazzle Snaxxs,” a diet program called “Silhouette Solutions,” and a skincare line called “BioCé Cosmeceuticals.” Like Trump University, vitamin marketers were well-versed in what to do on the off-chance someone suggested Donald Trump would <em>ever</em> attach his name to something less than entirely legal:</p><div data-reactid="233"><blockquote>
<p>The people at the Trump Network are trained to defend against allegations that it’s a pyramid scheme. Toward the end of Izzo’s seminar, we break into pairs to practice what to say when potential invitees suggest the business is a pyramid scheme. My partner is Billy, a former Wall Street trader who has worked his way up to “diamond director,” one of the highest levels in the company. The levels are determined by the number of people you recruit and the amount of products you and your downline purchase. “What’s a pyramid scheme?” he asks me. “Like the food pyramid? Like the Catholic Church? What about where you work? If you ask me, corporate America is a pyramid scheme. All the people on the top make all the money. The people at the bottom are spinning their wheels.” Then he plays his Trump card: “You think Donald Trump would involve himself in a pyramid scheme?”</p>
</blockquote></div><p data-reactid="234">In fact: yes! We do! We can also believe that Trump, a <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/white-house-staff-can-barely-keep-up-with-trump-lies">known</a> <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/the-mooch-trump-not-a-liar-just-a-connoisseur-of-mistruth">liar</a>, allegedly told people they’d make so much money from these scams that they’d be able to quit their day jobs. <a href="https://twitter.com/JuddLegum/status/1056942139521810437">Per the suit</a>:</p><div data-reactid="235"><blockquote>
<p>Trump doubled down on his claim during in-person endorsements, going so far as to suggest ACN was risk-free. Onstage at ACN’s International Convention in Barcelona, Spain, in March 2011, Trump explained to the auditorium that: “A lot of the [ACN] people that I’ve met had their job for two or three years, and all of a sudden they started leaving out of their job and going full-time at ACN because they’re making more money with ACN. So I like it because it really takes the risk out. It takes a lot of the risk out of the decision.”</p>
</blockquote></div><p data-reactid="236">Of course, for at least one plaintiff, that <a href="https://twitter.com/JuddLegum/status/1056938204731969538">wasn’t the case at all</a>:</p><div data-reactid="237"><blockquote>
<p>Plaintiff Jane Doe is a resident of California who works as a hospice caregiver. In 2014, Doe attended a meeting for prospective ACN recruits. As she listened to the presentations, Doe was skeptical and unpersuaded. But then she saw a promotional video prominently featuring Trump. Trump’s endorsement was the turning point. . . . Doe had no idea Trump was being paid lavishly for his endorsement—the video made no mention of that. Doe joined ACN then and there. Despite her limited resources, Doe wrote a check for the $499 registration fee, in reliance on Trump’s endorsement. In the two years that followed, Doe paid thousands of dollars in fees and expenses to attend ACN events and host ACN meetings in an effort to succeed with the business. But, ultimately, she had extremely limited success—she earned a single check for $38.</p>
</blockquote></div><p data-reactid="238">In a statement, <strong>Alan Garten,</strong> a lawyer for the Trump Organization, said the allegations in the suit are meritless and should be paid no attention because the plaintiffs’ attorney fees are being funded by a nonprofit whose chairman is a Democratic donor. “This is clearly just another effort by opponents of the President to use the court system to advance a political agenda,” he told the <em>Times.</em> <strong>Roberta Kaplan</strong> and <strong>Andrew Celli Jr.,</strong> two lawyers for the plaintiffs, said “the case is being brought now because it is ready now,” and, to be fair, this isn’t the first time Trump has been accused of fraud. “This case connects the dots at the Trump Organization and involves systematic fraud that spanned more than a decade, involved multiple Trump businesses and caused tremendous harm to thousands of hardworking Americans,” the attorneys said in a statement.</p><div id="cns-ads-slot-type-article-in-text-0" class="cns-ads-stage cns-ads-slot-type-article-in-text cns-ads-slot-type-article-in-text-0" data-name="article_in_text_0" data-slot-type="article_in_text" style="font-size: 0px; line-height: 0; overflow: hidden;"><div id="article_in_text_0" class="cns-ads-container" data-ad-seq="0" style="margin: 0px auto; box-sizing: content-box;"></div></div><p data-reactid="239"><em><strong>If you would like to receive the Levin Report in your inbox daily, <a href="http://tinyletter.com/besslevin">click here</a> to subscribe.</strong></em></p><div id="cne-interlude-1" data-cne-interlude=""><div><style>#cne-interlude-1 .cne-interlude-container {

So let’s just zero in on the money.\n&lt;p&gt;“I’m &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; rich,” Trump declared while announcing his candidacy in June 2015. To prove it, he released a “Summary of Net Worth” balance sheet, indicating a net worth of $8,737,540,000. A month later he upwardly revised that figure to “in excess of TEN BILLION DOLLARS.” (The caps are his.)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Since then, a cottage industry of spreadsheet-diving journalists has worked itself into a lather trying to peg his real net worth. But without tax returns to go on, it’s really anybody’s guess. Despite the all-caps figures Trump has dispensed, most estimates from the established financial-media outlets have been lower, FAR LOWER. &lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt; put his net worth at $4.5 billion. &lt;em&gt;Fortune&lt;/em&gt; postulated $3.7 billion, and later upped it to $3.9 billion. Bloomberg guessed it was “closer to $2.9 billion.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In response to these wanton guesstimates, Trump instinctually fired back at the guesstimators. “&lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt; is a bankrupt magazine, doesn’t know what they’re talking about.” “&lt;em&gt;Fortune&lt;/em&gt; has no idea what my assets are” and “has totally lost its way.” But the real sulfuric acid was reserved for the lowballers over at Bloomberg. As usual, Trump made it personal, even suggesting his “friend,” the former New York City mayor, might be jealous. “Maybe Michael told them to do it,” Trump speculated in the &lt;em&gt;Daily Mail,&lt;/em&gt; “because he always wanted to do what I’m doing.” Perhaps wisely, &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8212;even with its legendary phalanx of persnickety fact-checkers&amp;#8212;wouldn’t venture any closer than “just a back-of-the-envelope calculation” of $2.56 billion, “which shouldn’t be taken too seriously.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In November, Trump was elected president of the United States in a shocking turn of events. He lost the popular vote by some two million ballots.&lt;/p&gt;","socialMedia":[],"photos":{"tout":[{"aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":1400,"height":700,"format":"JPEG","url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2016/05/27/5748bf85ee949d2f614302a8_hive-contributor-profile-donald-trump.jpg"}},"revisionCreatedAt":"May 27, 2016 5:43 pm","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","image":true},"revisionAuthor":"Alyssa Karas","filename":"hive-contributor-profile-donald-trump.jpg","_embedded":{"categories-channels":[],"variantXsmall":[],"variantSmall":[],"variantMedium":[],"variantLarge":[],"variantXlarge":[],"_categories":{}},"title":"hive-contributor-profile-donald-trump.jpg","credit":"By John Lamparski/WireImage/Getty Images.","_links":{},"id":"5748bf85b58adb2f614da194","createdAt":"May 27, 2016 5:43 pm","revision":2,"modifiedAt":"May 27, 2016 5:43 pm","description":"Getty not 250: 522842094","contributors":{}}]},"pubDate":"May 25, 2017 11:21 am","url":"/people/donald-trump","mainPhotoContributors":{},"_embedded":{"photosTout":[{"fields":{"aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":1400,"height":700,"format":"JPEG","url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2016/05/27/5748bf85ee949d2f614302a8_hive-contributor-profile-donald-trump.jpg"}},"revisionCreatedAt":"May 27, 2016 5:43 pm","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","image":true},"revisionAuthor":"Alyssa Karas","filename":"hive-contributor-profile-donald-trump.jpg","_embedded":{"categories-channels":[],"variantXsmall":[],"variantSmall":[],"variantMedium":[],"variantLarge":[],"variantXlarge":[],"_categories":{}},"title":"hive-contributor-profile-donald-trump.jpg","credit":"By John Lamparski/WireImage/Getty Images.","_links":{},"id":"5748bf85b58adb2f614da194","createdAt":"May 27, 2016 5:43 pm","revision":2,"modifiedAt":"May 27, 2016 5:43 pm","description":"Getty not 250: 522842094","contributors":{}}}],"contributorsAuthor":[],"contributorsPhotographer":[],"_categories":{},"publishHistory":{"entityId":"5748bf9ab58adb2f614da195","revision":5,"pubDate":"May 25, 2017 11:21 am","revisionAuthor":"Jarondakie Patrick","searchable":true,"expired":false,"createdAt":"August 1, 2017 5:46 pm","uri":"people/donald-trump"},"related":[{}]},"relatedItems":{"items":[{"hed":"“This Administration Is Hoping This Will Blow Over”: The Foreign-Policy Community Loses Any Remaining Faith in Trump","promoHed":"“They’re Trying to Run the Table”: Experts Fear the Saudis Have Steamrolled Trump","dek":"Inside Washington, foreign-policy experts hoping for a reset swiftly downgraded their expectations.

For decades, a succession of U.S. presidents have disguised the brutal realpolitik of America’s relationship with Saudi Arabia under a patina of moral superiority and willful ignorance. Trump dispatched with the illusion entirely. “This took place in Turkey, and to the best of our knowledge, Khashoggi is not a United States citizen,” he told reporters, computing the value of Khashoggi’s life in real time. “He’s a permanent resident.” On the phone with Fox News, when asked about the possibility of canceling an arms deal with Riyadh, Trump was similarly forthright regarding the hard economic calculus. “I think that would be hurting us,” he said. “We have jobs. We have a lot of things happening in this country.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Inside Washington, foreign-policy experts hoping for a reset swiftly downgraded their expectations. And as the Khashoggi affair has played out, disappointment has morphed to cynicism within the diplomatic community. “It’s fairly clear that this administration is hoping this will blow over in some respect or another,” &lt;strong&gt;Peter Juul,&lt;/strong&gt; a senior policy analyst at the Center for American Progress, sighed in an interview. On Tuesday, Secretary of State &lt;strong&gt;Mike Pompeo&lt;/strong&gt; had made a perfunctory concession to critics by revoking the visas for some of the Saudi officials linked to Khashoggi’s death. But it was largely an empty gesture&amp;#8212;18 of the 21 Saudi suspects were already under arrest, and likely fated to die in a Saudi prison. (At least one of the men involved in the “hit team” had already [died in a mysterious &lt;a href=\"https://nypost.com/2018/10/18/saudi-who-arrived-in-turkey-day-of-khashoggi-disappearance-dies-in-traffic-accident/\"&gt;“traffic accident”&lt;/a&gt; upon returning to Riyadh.) “This was a perfect moment for Trump to step out and say, ‘We Americans reject this, because we believe in what we believe,” former U.S. ambassador &lt;strong&gt;Nicholas Burns,&lt;/strong&gt; said, incensed. “He missed it, because he doesn’t think about these things . . . I think we’re seeing the hollowness of his presidency. Truly. There’s no moral center to it.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Notably, many are sympathetic to the bind the Trump administration has found itself in. “To be fair, any administration of either party&amp;#8212;Trump, Obama, Bush, Clinton&amp;#8212;would have found this challenging,” Burns told me. “I don’t think there’s anybody out there, a senior person who’s worked in government, saying we should end our relationship with Saudi Arabia over this.” After all, Saudi Arabia is a critical U.S. ally&amp;#8212;from both a strategic and economic standpoint. The Saudis serve as an imperfect ally of Israel, and are seen as a check on Iranian hegemony in the Middle East. “To be honest, when it comes to tangible policy, another administration may not have been all that different than Trump,” &lt;strong&gt;John Glaser,&lt;/strong&gt; the director of foreign policy at the Cato Institute, told me. “A typical administration would almost certainly have been more critical of the Saudis following the Khashoggi murder, but probably gently so. With the exception of some symbolic penalties&amp;#8212;formal condemnations, calls for investigation, possibly a temporary suspension of arms sales&amp;#8212;the U.S.-Saudi relationship would probably not be fundamentally altered.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It is too early to tell whether Khashoggi’s murder has brought the U.S. establishment to a tipping point. Over the past weeks, both Republican and Democratic lawmakers have voiced frustration with Saudi Arabia, its war in Yemen, and the Saudi regime’s apparent disregard for America’s multi-billion-dollar patronage. But Washington is also awash in Saudi money, which funds dozens of think tanks, P.R. and consulting firms, and provides sinecures for all manner of Swamp creatures. The Trump administration, certainly, has yet to telegraph any interest in altering its relationship with Riyadh, let alone with Crown Prince &lt;strong&gt;Mohammed bin Salman,&lt;/strong&gt; who has a close personal connection with &lt;strong&gt;Jared Kushner.&lt;/strong&gt; If there was a window for Trump to exert his leverage over Saudi Arabia&amp;#8212;a desert economy with a singular, but depleting, natural resource&amp;#8212;he missed the opportunity. Nor did he bother to engage with the European Union or NATO allies, as past administrations likely would have done, signaling the extent to which “America First” has also come to mean “America Alone.” Meanwhile, Juul lamented, the Saudis are “very much all in on Trump. They’re trying to see what they can get away with in however long he’s in office. They’re trying to run the table.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thomas Lippman,&lt;/strong&gt; who served as the Middle East bureau chief for &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post,&lt;/em&gt; put it more succinctly. “The crown prince is clearly going to brazen it out. There is not going to be any fundamental rupture in relations between Saudi Arabia and the United States,” he said. “I am not saying that people are not upset about it. I am saying that on the scale of grievances that Saudi Arabia and the United States have had over the past 75 years, this too shall pass.” Lippman, the author of &lt;em&gt;Saudi Arabia on the Edge&lt;/em&gt;, noted with dismay the limits of America’s historical memory, and the sins that are excused in the name of global stability. “Nothing that happened to Jamal Khashoggi is in the same ballpark as the death of the collective outrage in the United States over 9/11. And it did not lead to even a temporary rupture of economic and strategic relations with Saudi Arabia.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the White House attempts to move on, the diplomatic community has turned to Congress. “I think if there’s going to be any movement on it, it’s going to come from Congress,” Juul said. Outrage on Capitol Hill quickly eclipsed the White House’s glacial response as grisly details of Khashoggi’s death became public in the week since Khashoggi disappeared inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on October 2. “We deal with bad people all the time, but this is in our face,” South Carolina Senator &lt;strong&gt;Lindsey Graham,&lt;/strong&gt; a traditionally staunch defender of the U.S.-Saudi relationship, said during an interview with &lt;em&gt;Fox &amp;amp; Friends,&lt;/em&gt; urging the president to “sanction the hell out of Saudi Arabia.” Such indignation spans the aisle. As one congressional aide &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/mike-pompeo-jamal-khashoggi-saudi-arabia\"&gt;told me&lt;/a&gt; last week, “Across the Hill, there is just absolute disgust at what seems to have taken place.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What Congress will do, if anything, remains unclear. Sending a strong bipartisan message to the White House, 22 senators released a letter that triggered the Global Magnitsky Act, requiring the administration to open an investigation into the circumstances surrounding Khashoggi’s murder and issue a report on whether it will sanction the individuals involved. But Congress cannot force Trump to sanction anyone under the act. “All they can do is call for a report from the executive, and kind of potentially embarrass the executive if they choose not to impose those sanctions,” said &lt;strong&gt;Jarrett Blanc,&lt;/strong&gt; a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment who previously served in the State Department. “That is certainly what they are doing so far.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There are other areas, however, where Congress has greater leverage. For instance, any future U.S. arms deals with the Saudis will require congressional sign-off, and lawmakers have broad authority over funding U.S. involvement in Saudi Arabia’s war in Yemen. “We could, bluntly, really end their war, depending on how far we want to push in terms of the different kinds of support that we provide, and not providing it,” Blanc said. “They could radically change policy in that area if they choose to.” To that end, a bipartisan group of lawmakers led by Congressman &lt;strong&gt;Jim McGovern&lt;/strong&gt; have introduced a bill that would ban all arms sales and military cooperation with Saudi Arabia, effectively ending U.S. support for the war in Yemen. Last week, Senator &lt;strong&gt;Jack Reed,&lt;/strong&gt; the ranking Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said the U.S. should block all offensive arms sales to Saudi Arabia and that the U.S. military should stop refueling Saudi aircraft fighting in Yemen.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Criticizing the war in Yemen, a proxy battle with Iran, is not necessarily new ground for some members of Congress, but the Khashoggi affair could catalyze change. As a second Congressional aide explained to me, “There is a sort of backlash around this&amp;#8212;based on the media coverage and, sort of, the interest in Congress&amp;#8212;that is unusual, and would seem to be sort of pushing the needle a little bit, maybe.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But with Congress on recess until after the November midterms, there is a concern that any momentum could fade. “The timing is unfortunate. The lame duck is unfortunate,” the second Congressional aide said. “But I do think that the level of public pressure on the administration is important. Hopefully, if for no other reason than it’s the right thing to do. People should be outraged about this.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For now, the White House is stuck with Mohammed bin Salman, a monster of its own making. “He has been really successful in doing one thing, I think that may be his only real success. He has eliminated all competition and gave no other alternative to himself,” &lt;strong&gt;Ali Al-Ahmed,&lt;/strong&gt; a Saudi dissident and founder and director of the Institute for Gulf Affairs, told me. “That is reality. You like him or not, that is a fact. There is no one.” The big question for the Trump administration is what will its relationship with Saudi Arabia look like moving forward, knowing that M.B.S. isn’t going anywhere anytime soon. “That is, to me, the long-term question we have to ask ourselves,” a former high-ranking State Department official told me. “Regardless of how this story plays out, regardless of how the narrative eventually evolves. Do we have a partner in Saudi Arabia on whom we can depend to conduct himself and the affairs of his nation in that mature, thoughtful, careful way?”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;","rubric":"Foreign Policy","socialTitle":"“They’re Trying to Run the Table”: Experts Fear the Saudis Have Steamrolled Trump","socialDescription":"Inside Washington, foreign-policy experts hoping for a reset swiftly downgraded their expectations.

Trump,&lt;/strong&gt; along with &lt;strong&gt;Melania, Ivanka,&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Jared,&lt;/strong&gt; traveled to Pittsburgh following Saturday’s mass shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue. A visit by a sitting president in the wake of a devastating event is, of course, fairly standard and often welcomed&amp;#8212;&lt;strong&gt;Barack Obama,&lt;/strong&gt; for example, &lt;a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2012/12/16/167412995/transcript-president-obama-at-sandy-hook-prayer-vigil\"&gt;spoke&lt;/a&gt; at a vigil in Newtown, Connecticut, two days after the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary school, &lt;a href=\"https://www.ctpost.com/local/article/The-president-comes-to-comfort-Newtown-4122455.php\"&gt;comforting&lt;/a&gt; the families that had just suffered an unthinkable tragedy. In this case, however, things were a little different! On Monday, Mayor &lt;strong&gt;Bill Peduto&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/pittsburgh-mayor-sends-message-to-trump-do-not-come-during-funerals\"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; he had tried to “get a message out to the White House” that it would be better if the president stayed in Washington, while thousands of people signed signed &lt;a href=\"https://www.bendthearc.us/open_letter_to_president_trump\"&gt;a letter&lt;/a&gt; written by a Jewish group based in Pittsburgh telling Trump he wasn’t welcome. That probably had something to do with the fact that the president &lt;a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-pennsylvania-shooting-trump-remarks/trump-says-pittsburgh-shooting-has-little-to-do-with-gun-laws-idUSKCN1N10M3\"&gt;blamed the victims&lt;/a&gt; following the attack, insisting that the shooting had nothing to do with gun laws and that “If they had some kind of a protection inside the temple maybe it could have been a very much different situation.” That the president has refused to disavow white nationalist and anti-Semites, and, some say, &lt;a href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/radio/thecurrent/the-current-for-august-14-2017-1.4244057/trump-has-emboldened-white-nationalists-with-racist-policies-says-author-1.4246077\"&gt;emboldened&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/08/the-battle-that-erupted-in-charlottesville-is-far-from-over/567167/\"&gt;them&lt;/a&gt;, may also have been a contributing factor.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Trump has never been one to take a hint, and chose instead to ignore the pleas of a grieving community. That resulted, unsurprisingly, in &lt;a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/congressional-leaders-decline-to-join-trump-in-visit-to-pittsburgh-after-massacre/2018/10/30/34709010-dc4e-11e8-aa33-53bad9a881e8_story.html\"&gt;protests&lt;/a&gt;, at least one victim’s family refusing to meet with him, and dismay on the parts of local officials who said the community “didn’t think this was the time for a political photo shoot,” especially given “the divisive nature of [the president’s] rhetoric.” But as far as Trump is concerned, the visit was a rousing success! Because from his vantage point, he was treated with the deference and respect he thinks he deserves, and didn’t have to personally witness anyone telling him to GTFO, which &lt;a href=\"https://www.msnbc.com/the-last-word/watch/pittsburgh-protester-to-trump-you-re-the-one-who-can-stop-these-tragedies-1357612099574?v=railb&amp;amp;\"&gt;happened often

president did not give any formal remarks&amp;#8212;as you can see in the bizarre highlight reel produced by the White House above&amp;#8212;but if he had, presumably they’d involve the words, “Remember, Pittsburgh, at the end of the day, it’s all about me.”&lt;/p&gt;","rubric":"Pittsburgh","socialTitle":"Trump Thanks Mourners For Keeping Their “Small Protest” Out of

Not from, say, &lt;a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-tariffs-trade-war-layoffs-business-losses-2018-8\"&gt;job-killing trade wars&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"http://www.nhpr.org/post/pittsburgh-synagogue-shooting-called-domestic-terrorism\"&gt;domestic terrorists&lt;/a&gt;, but something much scarier: a “caravan” of migrants traveling north toward the U.S. border. Earlier in the month, the president claimed, with &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/white-house-staff-can-barely-keep-up-with-trump-lies\"&gt;zero evidence&lt;/a&gt;, that “criminals and unknown Middle Easterners are mixed in” with groups of Central Americans seeking refuge in America. Over the weekend, he attempted to heighten the drama by ordering thousands of troops to the border&amp;#8212;a wildly transparent political ploy, considering the caravan is weeks away and those in it plan to surrender and apply for amnesty. Now, with exactly a week until the election, Trump has lobbed a Hail Mary that he clearly hopes will convince voters that Republicans like him are the only thing standing between them and a United States in which every undocumented immigrant gets to kick an American out of their house: a bald-faced lie about how he’s going to issue a (likely unconstitutional!) executive order to end “birthright citizenship.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In a promo for &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt; on HBO, Trump said, “We’re the only country in the world where a person comes in and has a baby, and the baby is essentially a citizen of the United States . . . with all of those benefits,” which is only the first lie of the two-minute clip (More than thirty countries provide birthright citizenship.) Telling host &lt;strong&gt;Jonathan Swan&lt;/strong&gt; that the concept is “ridiculous,” Trump added that while “it was always told to me that you need a constitutional amendment [to get rid of it]” (true), in turns out “you don’t” (false), and claimed the president has the power to end the practice via executive order. &lt;a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-birthright-citizenship-14th-amendment-experts-2018-10\"&gt;Out here in reality, though&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In the U.S., birthright citizenship is enshrined in the 14th Amendment to the Constitution, which says: “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;“Trump has zero authority to amend the Constitution through executive fiat, and he certainly can’t do it with a tweet,” &lt;strong&gt;Matthew Kolken,&lt;/strong&gt; an immigration attorney in Buffalo, New York, told Business Insider on Tuesday. Kolken added that it would be “virtually impossible” to amend the Constitution in today’s political climate. Amendments require either a two-thirds majority vote in both the House of Representatives and the Senate or a constitutional convention called for by two-thirds of State legislatures.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;While some conservatives like to &lt;a href=\"https://www.axios.com/trump-birthright-citizenship-executive-order-0cf4285a-16c6-48f2-a933-bd71fd72ea82.html\"&gt;claim&lt;/a&gt; that the 14th Amendment was only supposed to provide citizenship to babies born in the U.S. to lawful permanent residents&amp;#8212;an argument Vice President &lt;strong&gt;Mike Pence&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/politico/status/1057290978900492290\"&gt;articulated&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday morning&amp;#8212;experts predict that not even a Supreme Court stocked with two judges handpicked by President Law and Order is likely to go for such an argument. “I think the 14th Amendment is clear in enshrining birthright citizenship in the law, and there is interpretive case law from the Supreme Court supporting this,” &lt;strong&gt;Greg Siskind,&lt;/strong&gt; an immigration lawyer, told Business Insider. “Even with a conservative Supreme Court, I have faith the Court will reject this extremist act.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Still, others predict that there could be some wiggle room. Constitutional scholar &lt;strong&gt;John Eastman&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.axios.com/trump-birthright-citizenship-executive-order-0cf4285a-16c6-48f2-a933-bd71fd72ea82.html\"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; Axios that the amendment originally referred to green-card holders and citizens. If Trump follows through on his threat, he said, “the courts would have to weigh in in a way they haven’t.” For Trump, though, actually having the power to end birthright citizenship and convincing the base he does are two very separate things. It doesn’t much matter if he’s lying through his caps, as long as they believe him, which they &lt;a

Khashoggi.","body":"&lt;section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was, to be sure, a discomfiting scene: there was Secretary of State &lt;strong&gt;Mike Pompeo&lt;/strong&gt; amiably clutching the hand of Saudi Crown Prince &lt;strong&gt;Mohammed bin Salman&lt;/strong&gt; in an ornate meeting room in Riyadh a mere fortnight after &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; columnist and Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi had gone missing. The steady drumbeat of revelations had been perplexing and damning and almost inconceivable: the video evidence of Khashoggi entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul; the reports of a 15-person Saudi “kill” team landing in the city, including a so-called bone-saw expert; and &lt;strong&gt;Donald Trump’s&lt;/strong&gt; myriad equivocations. Yet as evidence increasingly suggested a connection between M.B.S. and the presumed murder, Pompeo’s visit seemed like the latest assault to diplomacy. Despite what should have been a somber, mordant affair, he looked like Ed McMahon about to present an oversize check before the camera. (On Friday night, the Saudis conceded what everyone had long known: Khashoggi was dead.)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Back in Washington, members of the diplomatic and intelligence community that I spoke with were gobsmacked. While Axios has &lt;a href=\"https://www.axios.com/saudi-arabia-mike-pompeo-meeting-jamal-khashoggi-1480d505-dcbc-46cb-97e0-34ba5a08655f.html\"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that Pompeo uttered harsh words beneath his avuncular civility, many found the optics insurmountable. “The grip and grin sort of stunned people who saw it,” a congressional aide told me. “There is a lack of confidence that he is doing everything in his power to actually get the truth in this case.” Among diplomatic veterans, Pompeo’s affable demeanor was a real misstep. “Pompeo did not handle this well,” a former high-ranking State Department official sighed. “I don’t think it would have been difficult to be more somber in meetings and more nuanced in comments afterward.” As one State department official lamented to me, “Certainly from where I sit, it is discouraging to see the administration seemingly subordinate our values to other interests in such an egregious case.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Since reports of Khashoggi’s disappearance first began to circulate, Trump has signaled that the death of one journalist&amp;#8212;a citizen of Saudi Arabia, not the United States&amp;#8212;was not worth rupturing the U.S.-Saudi relationship. Last week, the president said it would be a “very tough pill to swallow for our country” if the kingdom was found to be responsible for the assumed killing of Khashoggi, and a $110 billion U.S. arms sales deal with Saudi Arabia was correspondingly imperiled. And despite mounting evidence that M.B.S. was involved, Trump suggested as recently as Monday that “rogue killers” could have been behind the hit. “I have never seen anything quite like that, with the president playing the role of defense lawyer to someone who appears to have murdered a U.S. resident overseas in flagrant violation of every diplomatic norm,” &lt;strong&gt;Daniel Benaim,&lt;/strong&gt; who served as a Middle East adviser to Vice President &lt;strong&gt;Joe Biden,&lt;/strong&gt; told me. “Not to even pretend to have an interest in the rule of law, and to jump straight to the part where you whitewash others’ crimes, is a gross abdication of American values.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;“The president was making excuses for the Saudis. The president, normally, would never do that,” said another former high-ranking State Department official who served in the Middle East. Instead, this source explained, a typical president would stress the seriousness of the situation, praise Khashoggi and the free press, call for an investigation&amp;#8212;possibly by the United Nations&amp;#8212;and rally U.S. allies to consolidate intelligence. By no means would he or she have expressed concerns that the arms agreement could become collateral. “There would be no indication one way or the other of what we were going to be doing,” they said.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not hyperbole to suggest that the Trump administration’s handling of the M.B.S. matter could well define the second half of the president’s term. The U.S.-Saudi relationship impacts everything, on a meta level, from oil prices to the Middle East peace puzzle. More specifically, Saudi Arabia has used its vast sovereign wealth fund, the Public Investment Fund, to intertwine itself with the American financial community&amp;#8212;Saudi money flows through Uber, JPMorgan Chase, Blackstone, Snap, and, &lt;a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2018/10/16/shiny-hollywood-partnership-with-saudi-arabia-suddenly-thrown-its-head/?utm_term=.92779c3aadda\"&gt;until recently&lt;/a&gt;, William Morris Endeavor. It’s also a bulwark against a nuclear Iran, a sort of inelegant centerpiece of Israel’s defense.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;More so than during the early crises of his presidency, Trump appears to comprehend the complexity of it all, which may be what has rendered his administration’s response so limp. Earlier this month, Trump harangued on Twitter that M.B.S. was innocent until proven guilty, a similar refrain he had used to protect &lt;strong&gt;Brett Kavanaugh’s&lt;/strong&gt; nomination. In the end, he seems to be hoping that the whole thing will blow over.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This defensiveness largely falls flat among his fellow lawmakers. “Across the Hill, there is just absolute disgust at what seems to have taken place, and bewilderment over the way the administration has reacted. And I think that runs the gamut from people whose baseline position would be deeply skeptical of the U.S.-Saudi relationship to people who have been traditionally strong supporters of the U.S.-Saudi relationship,” the congressional staffer told me. “By and large, the reaction on the Hill is outrage, and an insistence that we get ourselves a full, clear accounting and a deep skepticism that the Saudis are investigating this on their own&amp;#8212;despite Secretary Pompeo’s assurances&amp;#8212;are really going to provide clarity.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Benaim distilled the dissonance. “Other administrations would certainly have struggled with how to balance America’s values and interests, given the way a case like this impacts both,” he told me. “But Donald Trump doesn’t seem to have that struggle.” Instead, Trump says the quiet part out loud. “In a funny way, what you see is Donald Trump basically adopting the left-wing critique of the U.S.-Saudi relationship&amp;#8212;which reduces a very complex situation with a lot of different variables&amp;#8212;to basically, ‘They can get away with murder, because they are going to buy our weapons.’ He is actually taking the leftist critique of the relationship&amp;#8212;and embracing it.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the Khashoggi drama has unfolded, the close relationship between M.B.S. and &lt;strong&gt;Jared Kushner,&lt;/strong&gt; Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, has come under renewed scrutiny. (&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/18/world/middleeast/jamal-khashoggi-killing-saudi-arabia.html\"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; this week that Kushner was advocating on M.B.S.’s behalf within the White House.) Their relationship dates back to the early days of Trump’s presidency, when &lt;strong&gt;Rex Tillerson&lt;/strong&gt; was still running the State Department. As &lt;strong&gt;Dexter Filkins&lt;/strong&gt; has &lt;a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/in-the-wake-of-khashoggis-disappearance-saudi-arabias-crown-prince-is-pushed-to-the-brink\"&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker,&lt;/em&gt; Kushner identified M.B.S. as a “change agent” in the region, and developed a relationship that effectively sidelined Tillerson. According to one former administration official, Kushner’s communications with M.B.S. over the encrypted messaging service WhatsApp were a point of contention within the administration, one that was partly assuaged when Kushner began providing screenshots of his conversations with the National Security Council. But, this person added, “It was still an after-the-fact thing.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In recent days, a number of sources I have spoken with have raised the possibility that M.B.S.’s ties to Kushner may have instilled in the crown prince a belief that America would, indeed, turn a blind eye to the murder of Khashoggi. “I think there is a lot to be said [about how] M.B.S. thought he could get away with it because Jared Kushner was in his pocket, and so was the president for that matter,” the former State Department official who worked in the Middle East said. And after all, the Trump administration has largely ignored the war in Yemen; the strange sojourn of Lebanese Prime Minister &lt;strong&gt;Saad Hariri&lt;/strong&gt; to Saudi Arabia; the ill-fated boycott of Qatar; and M.B.S.’s spats with Canada and Germany. “The Trump administration made it clear that he had a blank check, and so what do you do when you have a blank check? You write in the craziest sum imaginable and take it to the bank, and that is what he did,” Benaim told me. “Only it seems that the blank check has bounced&amp;#8212;at least with Congress, if not with the president.” (The White House did not respond to a request from comment.)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Whether Trump will yield to the pressure from Capitol Hill and the international community, or side with his son-in-law and his buddy, remains an open question. But if evidence indeed shows that M.B.S. was behind the death of Khashoggi, the crown prince will join the ranks of Syrian President &lt;strong&gt;Bashar al-Assad,&lt;/strong&gt; Russian President &lt;strong&gt;Vladimir Putin,&lt;/strong&gt; and North Korean dictator &lt;strong&gt;Kim Jong Un,&lt;/strong&gt; all of whom have engaged in extraterritorial murders to send a clear message to dissidents. Meanwhile, any remaining hope that M.B.S. is the idealist he’s claimed to be has rapidly dissipated. “I think there was legitimate hope when M.B.S. came on the scene that he was going to be a reformer, and he was going to change course,” the congressional aide told me. “And despite initial appearances and words to that effect, it is pretty clear that is not the case.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;","rubric":"Foreign Policy","socialTitle":"“Absolute Disgust”: Diplomats Fume Over Pompeo’s Saudi “Grip and Grin”","socialDescription":"Throughout Washington, people

few things you can always count on. First, that death comes for everyone. Second, that the current president of the United States will &lt;a href=\"https://www.thecut.com/2018/10/trump-stormy-daniels-horseface-tweet.html\"&gt;call&lt;/a&gt; an adult-film star he paid to keep quiet about an alleged affair “horseface” on social media. And third, that after passing a $1.5 trillion tax cut they insisted would pay for itself &lt;em&gt;and then some,&lt;/em&gt; Republicans would blame social services like Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security for exploding deficits and debt and insist that such “entitlements,” sadly, have got to go.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As a reminder, the Grand Old Party put on a big show of pretending to care about “fiscal responsibility” when &lt;strong&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/strong&gt; was in office and mouth-watering tax cuts weren’t on the line. “Only one thing can save this country, and that’s to get a handle on this deficit-and-debt issue,” Majority Leader &lt;strong&gt;Mitch McConnell&lt;/strong&gt; insisted after the 44th president won his second term. “The federal fiscal burden threatens the security, liberty, and independence of our nation,” the Republican Party platform &lt;a href=\"https://prod-cdn-static.gop.com/media/documents/DRAFT_12_FINAL%5B1%5D-ben_1468872234.pdf\"&gt;warned&lt;/a&gt; in 2016. “You’re bankrupting our grandchildren!” was a common refrain, as were proclamations &lt;a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/video/full-corker-won-t-support-gop-tax-plan-if-it-adds-to-deficit-1059037763567\"&gt;such as&lt;/a&gt;, “I won’t endorse a bill that adds one penny to the deficit!” Then &lt;strong&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/strong&gt; won the election, and all those worries about crippling the next generation and the country going to hell in a handbasket vanished overnight&amp;#8212;almost as though it was feigned in the first place!&amp;#8212;with Republicans not only demanding that Congress pass a deficit-busting piece of legislation so that the president and his children &lt;a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/20/trump-tax-bill-savings-analysis\"&gt;could pay even fewer taxes&lt;/a&gt; than they &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/donald-trump-fred-trump-taxes\"&gt;already&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/13/business/jared-kushner-taxes.html\"&gt;do&lt;/a&gt;, but maintaining&amp;#8212;laws of math, physics, time and space be damned&amp;#8212;that the bill &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/11/trump-tax-plan-name\"&gt;once known as the “Cut Cut Cut Act”&lt;/a&gt; would actually help &lt;a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/16/trumps-tax-cut-didnt-reduce-the-deficit--despite-his-many-promises.html\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;shrink&lt;/em&gt; the deficit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But as the G.O.P. surely knew, that was never going to happen. Instead, as we &lt;a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/15/us-budget-deficit-expands-to-779-billion-in-fiscal-2018-as-spending-surges.html\"&gt;learned&lt;/a&gt; this week, the U.S. budget deficit increased to $779 billion for the fiscal year, a 17 percent increase from the year prior, which is extra bad considering the economy is doing well, a scenario in which &lt;a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2018/10/16/blame-republican-tax-cuts-soaring-federal-deficits-column/1657338002/\"&gt;the federal deficit typically falls&lt;/a&gt;. Luckily, Mitch McConnell knows exactly &lt;a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-16/mcconnell-blames-entitlements-not-gop-for-rising-deficits\"&gt;who and what to blame&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;“It’s disappointing, but it’s not a Republican problem,” McConnell said Tuesday in an interview with Bloomberg News when asked about the rising deficits and debt. “It’s a bipartisan problem: unwillingness to address the real drivers of the debt by doing anything to adjust those programs to the demographics of America in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The “real” drivers of debt, according to McConnell, are “Medicare, Social Security, and Medicaid,” “entitlements” from which the Senate majority leader would cut off the old and poor if only he could get Democrats to sign on. (That’s probably unlikely to happen, given &lt;strong&gt;Nancy Pelosi’s&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/mcconnell-calls-deficit-very-disturbing-blames-federal-spending-dismisses-criticism-of-tax-cut/2018/10/16/a5b93da0-d15c-11e8-8c22-fa2ef74bd6d6_story.html?utm_term=.a01fd08c01cd\"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; today that, “Like clockwork, Republicans in Congress are setting in motion their plan to destroy the Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security that seniors and families rely on, just months after they exploded the deficit by $2 trillion with their tax scam for the rich,” and &lt;strong&gt;Chuck Schumer’s&lt;/strong&gt; that suggesting cuts to “middle-class programs like Medicare, Social Security, and Medicaid as the only fiscally responsible solution to solve the debt problem is nothing short of gaslighting.”)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;McConnell’s take on the situation echoes that of the White House, whose National Economic Council director, &lt;strong&gt;Larry Kudlow,&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/09/gary-cohn-blames-waitresses-in-las-vegas-for-financial-crisis\"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; last month that he doesn’t “buy” the argument that tax cuts increase the deficit, and that the &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; problem is “principally spending too much.” (Kudlow, who has a penchant for &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/03/tv-pundit-who-blew-the-financial-crisis-could-be-trumps-next-gary-cohn\"&gt;never being right about anything&lt;/a&gt;, also &lt;a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/29/larry-kudlow-says-deficit-coming-down-rapidly-against-cbo-evidence.html\"&gt;claimed&lt;/a&gt; in June that the deficit was “coming down rapidly.”) Treasury Secretary &lt;strong&gt;Steven Mnuchin&lt;/strong&gt; was even more blunt while telling his &lt;a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/11/politics/mnuchin-budget-deficit/index.html\"&gt;assessment&lt;/a&gt; to CNN last week, “People are going to want to say the deficit is because of the tax cuts. That’s not the real story.” (The report out of his own department &lt;a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2018/10/16/blame-republican-tax-cuts-soaring-federal-deficits-column/1657338002/\"&gt;suggests otherwise&lt;/a&gt;.) Incidentally, in June, reports &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/07/the-trump-administration-wants-to-give-the-rich-another-giant-tax-cut\"&gt;circulated&lt;/a&gt; that the Trump administration was trying to figure out a workaround to cut another $100 billion from the tax bills of the wealthiest Americans, and in late September, House Republicans &lt;a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/house-republicans-pass-bill-to-extend-individual-tax-cuts/2018/09/28/2497d6bc-c326-11e8-97a5-ab1e46bb3bc7_story.html\"&gt;passed&lt;/a&gt; a piece of legislation that would add more than $600 billion to the debt over the next decade. Neither measure will come to fruition, but on the off-chance that one does, we’re sure McConnell stands ready to blame the poor and elderly freeloaders who clearly hate America.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you would like to receive the Levin Report in your inbox daily, &lt;a href=\"http://tinyletter.com/besslevin\"&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt; to subscribe.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trump: Saudi Arabia being falsely accused of murder just like Brett Kavanaugh was falsely accused of sexual assault&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;“I think we have to find out what happened first,” the president &lt;a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-16/trump-says-saudi-prince-denies-knowledge-of-khashoggi-incident\"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; the Associated Press on Tuesday while commenting on the compelling body of evidence that points to Saudi Arabia’s involvement in the disappearance of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. “Here we go again with, you know, you’re guilty until proven innocent. I don’t like that. We just went through that with Justice Kavanaugh and he was innocent all the way as far as I’m concerned.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;President of the United States now claiming Federal Reserve is the biggest threat to his presidency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, you heard that correctly: Not the special prosecutor’s Russia investigation, or the trade war with China that’s hurting U.S. companies in states that voted for him, or impeachment, but the Federal Reserve, &lt;a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/16/trump-says-fed-is-his-biggest-threat-because-it-is-raising-rates-too-fast.html\"&gt;which is run by his hand-picked Fed chair&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Trump on Tuesday escalated his assault on the Federal Reserve, calling it “my biggest threat.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;“Because the Fed is raising rates too fast. And it’s independent, so I don&amp;#39;t speak to him,” Trump said in an interview with Fox Business, referring to Fed Chairman &lt;strong&gt;Jerome Powell.&lt;/strong&gt; “But I’m not happy with what he’s doing because it’s going too fast. Because&amp;#8212;you look at the last inflation numbers, they’re very low.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Trump has been attacking Powell for several months now over the central banker’s decision to raise rates, which President Buy and Sell blamed last week for the two-day market decline. “The problem [causing the market drop] in my opinion is Treasury and the Fed,” he &lt;a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/11/trump-doubles-down-on-fed-attacks-saying-its-going-loco.html\"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; at the time. “The Fed is going loco and there’s no reason for them to do it. I’m not happy about it.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Beautiful, clean coal” industry won’t be getting its bailout just yet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And after all &lt;strong&gt;Rick Perry’s&lt;/strong&gt; hard work! &lt;a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2018/10/15/rick-perry-coal-rescue-trump-850528\"&gt;Per Politico&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The White House directed Perry to “prepare immediate steps to stop the loss” of retiring coal and nuclear plants more than four months ago, and Trump even interrupted an Ohio fund-raiser in May to order an aide to call Perry to talk about the bailout. He also touted the national security benefits of coal a few months later at another West Virginia speech. . . . But the White House has shelved the plan amid opposition from the president’s own advisers on the National Security Council and National Economic Council, according to four people with knowledge of the discussions.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;“The problem they’ve got is every option they might consider raises the costs for somebody at a time when nobody has an appetite for increased costs anywhere,” &lt;strong&gt;Bob Coward,&lt;/strong&gt; co-leader of energy advisory firm MPR Associates, told Politico. “I think that’s the problem they keep running into. The political will to pay for it is not broadly there enough yet for them.” Still, the industry can’t be &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; mad at the president, who ditched the Paris climate accord last year and has pushing to just &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/08/trump-epa-just-going-to-let-beautiful-clean-coal-plants-regulate-themselves\"&gt;let coal plants to regulate themselves&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elsewhere!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Uber Proposals Value Company at $120 Billion in a Possible I.P.O.

Daniels&lt;/strong&gt; a small, petty win, just one day after her &lt;a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/15/admin/stormy-daniels-lawsuit-dismissed-trump.html\"&gt;defamation lawsuit against &lt;strong&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was dismissed by a federal judge in California&amp;#8212;and just a few hours after the president gloated about the case on Twitter, belligerently calling the adult-film star &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2018/10/maybe-donald-trump-isnt-an-insult-genius-after-all\"&gt;“horseface.”&lt;/a&gt; According to the A.P., the president’s &lt;em&gt;60 Minutes&lt;/em&gt; interview on Sunday night &lt;a href=\"http://twitter.com/ZekeJMiller/status/1052265511898279937\"&gt;reached&lt;/a&gt; 11.7 million viewers, just over half as many as Daniels pulled for her own blockbuster &lt;em&gt;60 Minutes&lt;/em&gt; interview back in March. Around 22 million viewers tuned in then to watch Daniels discuss her alleged 2006 affair with the president. That interview got the program’s highest ratings since a 2008 interview with &lt;strong&gt;Barack&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Michelle Obama.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Trump’s episode also flopped in comparison to his &lt;em&gt;60 Minutes&lt;/em&gt; interview in 2016, &lt;a href=\"https://deadline.com/2016/11/donald-trump-60-minutes-interview-ratings-rise-seahawks-patriots-sunday-night-football-rises-nbc-nfl-cbs-1201853888/\"&gt;which drew&lt;/a&gt; 20 million viewers. In the latest interview, conducted by &lt;strong&gt;Lesley Stahl,&lt;/strong&gt; Trump &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/donald-trump-60-minutes-interview\"&gt;was asked about&lt;/a&gt; an array of topics, from the tariffs he’s slapped on China to his relationship with North Korean dictator &lt;strong&gt;Kim Jong Un.&lt;/strong&gt; “I’m not a baby,” he said when Stahl rattled off a quick list of accusations surrounding Kim, pressing Trump to explain his adoration for the dictator. “I know these things.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The president also spoke about Dr. &lt;strong&gt;Christine Blasey Ford&lt;/strong&gt; and his Mississippi speech, the one in which he mimicked the professor and essentially accused her of lying about her sexual assault allegation against &lt;strong&gt;Brett Kavanaugh&lt;/strong&gt; (who denied the accusation). “I’m not gonna get into it because we won,” Trump said when asked if, in hindsight, he thought had been disrespectful toward Ford. “It doesn’t matter. We won.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;While his bombastic quotes hurtled around the Internet, one particular image from the interview also got attention: a painting that now hangs in the White House and shows Trump sitting at a table and having drinks with Republican presidents of the past, including Abraham Lincoln, Teddy Roosevelt, and Ronald Reagan. Titled “The Republican Club,” the piece is &lt;a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-hangs-tacky-fantasy-painting-of-himself-with-gop-presidents-in-white-house\"&gt;by artist &lt;strong&gt;Andy Thomas&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and was a gift to the president from Rep. &lt;strong&gt;Darrell Issa.&lt;/strong&gt; Viewers also got a glimpse at a jar full of &lt;a href=\"https://www.eater.com/2018/10/15/17977946/donald-trump-starburst-red-pink-60-minutes-interview\"&gt;red and pink Starburst candies&lt;/a&gt; within arm’s reach of Trump’s desk.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Sunday night, it turns out, was a bit of a ratings pit for Trumps across the board, including the president’s principle &lt;em&gt;Saturday Night Live&lt;/em&gt; mimicker, &lt;strong&gt;Alec Baldwin.&lt;/strong&gt; The actor’s new talk show, &lt;em&gt;The Alec Baldwin Show,&lt;/em&gt; debuted to a frail 2.2 million viewers. Per &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://ew.com/tv/2018/10/15/alec-baldwin-talk-show-ratings/\"&gt;Entertainment Weekly&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; it was the lowest-rated show of the night for that demo on a broadcast network. In the episode, Baldwin chatted with &lt;strong&gt;Taraji P. Henson&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Robert De Niro.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","rubric":"clocking in","socialTitle":"Trump’s 60 Minutes Interview Was a Ratings Flop","socialDescription":"The

matter of public record that &lt;strong&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/strong&gt; is a lifelong huckster who will do anything to make a buck. Days after the 2016 election he agreed to pay $25 million &lt;a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/10/politics/trump-university-settlement-finalized-trnd/index.html\"&gt;to settle&lt;/a&gt; three lawsuits against Trump University, a smoke-and-mirrors operation that made University of Phoenix look like Stanford, where instructors were given a “playbook” that &lt;a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-trump-university-20160531-snap-story.html\"&gt;included&lt;/a&gt; the name of a TrumpU employee to call “if an Attorney General arrives on the scene.” Before that, the ex-beauty pageant owner was slapping his name on everything from &lt;a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-products-that-disappeared-list-2018-4\"&gt;steaks to mattresses to cologne to deodorant&lt;/a&gt; in exchange for lucrative licensing fees. In June, the New York attorney general &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/06/trump-foundation-lawsuit\"&gt;sued&lt;/a&gt; him alleging “persistently illegal conduct” related to the Donald J. Trump Foundation, charging that the charity served as “little more than a checkbook for payments to not-for-profits from Mr. Trump or the Trump Organization,” a suit &lt;strong&gt;Amanda Miller,&lt;/strong&gt; a spokeswoman for the Trump Organization, called “politics at its very worst.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In addition to a willingness to do anything to enrich himself&amp;#8212;like, for instance, &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/donald-trump-fred-trump-taxes\"&gt;(allegedly) dodging taxes for decades&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8212;we’ve yet to see evidence that the president of the United States cares about anyone not related to him by blood or marriage, or possesses the sort of moral compass that would prevent normal people from engaging in activity that hurts others. (According to &lt;em&gt;The New York Times,&lt;/em&gt; the Trump family &lt;a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/10/02/us/politics/donald-trump-tax-schemes-fred-trump.html\"&gt;created&lt;/a&gt; a company in 1992 that not only allowed the family to siphon millions to Trump, his siblings, and a cousin, but also let them pad invoices so they could raise the rent on low-income tenants who were supposed to be protected by rent regulations. In a statement, &lt;strong&gt;Charles Harder,&lt;/strong&gt; a lawyer for Trump, told the &lt;em&gt;Times:&lt;/em&gt; “There was no fraud or tax evasion by anyone” and that such affairs were “handled by other Trump family members.”) So, really, it shouldn’t come as a surprise in the slightest that the president and his three adult children have been &lt;a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/29/nyregion/trump-acn-lawsuit.html\"&gt;accused&lt;/a&gt; of pushing investment scams on thousands of vulnerable Americans in exchange for “lavish” payments they conveniently failed to mention in their sales pitches.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Filed in federal court in Manhattan on Monday . . . the 160-page complaint alleges that Mr. Trump and his family received secret payments from three business entities in exchange for promoting them as legitimate opportunities, when in reality they were get-rich-quick schemes that harmed investors, many of whom were unsophisticated and struggling financially.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Those business entities were ACN, a telecommunications marketing company that paid Mr. Trump millions of dollars to endorse its products; the Trump Network, a vitamin marketing enterprise; and the Trump Institute, which the suit said offered “extravagantly priced multiday training seminars” on Mr. Trump’s real estate “secrets.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The four plaintiffs, who were identified only with pseudonyms like Jane Doe, depict the Trump Organization as a racketeering enterprise that defrauded thousands of people for years as the president turned from construction to licensing his name for profit. The suit also names &lt;strong&gt;Donald Trump Jr., Ivanka Trump,&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Eric Trump&lt;/strong&gt; as defendants.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Back in 2011, &lt;em&gt;New York&lt;/em&gt;’s &lt;strong&gt;Jessica Pressler&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://nymag.com/nymag/features/70831/\"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; about the vitamin venture, which included products like “Prime Essentials” and “Custom Essentials,” a line of snacks for kids called “Snazzle Snaxxs,” a diet program called “Silhouette Solutions,” and a skincare line called “BioCé Cosmeceuticals.” Like Trump University, vitamin marketers were well-versed in what to do on the off-chance someone suggested Donald Trump would &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt; attach his name to something less than entirely legal:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The people at the Trump Network are trained to defend against allegations that it’s a pyramid scheme. Toward the end of Izzo’s seminar, we break into pairs to practice what to say when potential invitees suggest the business is a pyramid scheme. My partner is Billy, a former Wall Street trader who has worked his way up to “diamond director,” one of the highest levels in the company. The levels are determined by the number of people you recruit and the amount of products you and your downline purchase. “What’s a pyramid scheme?” he asks me. “Like the food pyramid? Like the Catholic Church? What about where you work? If you ask me, corporate America is a pyramid scheme. All the people on the top make all the money. The people at the bottom are spinning their wheels.” Then he plays his Trump card: “You think Donald Trump would involve himself in a pyramid scheme?”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In fact: yes! We do! We can also believe that Trump, a &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/white-house-staff-can-barely-keep-up-with-trump-lies\"&gt;known&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/the-mooch-trump-not-a-liar-just-a-connoisseur-of-mistruth\"&gt;liar&lt;/a&gt;, allegedly told people they’d make so much money from these scams that they’d be able to quit their day jobs. &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/JuddLegum/status/1056942139521810437\"&gt;Per the suit&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Trump doubled down on his claim during in-person endorsements, going so far as to suggest ACN was risk-free. Onstage at ACN’s International Convention in Barcelona, Spain, in March 2011, Trump explained to the auditorium that: “A lot of the [ACN] people that I’ve met had their job for two or three years, and all of a sudden they started leaving out of their job and going full-time at ACN because they’re making more money with ACN. So I like it because it really takes the risk out. It takes a lot of the risk out of the decision.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Of course, for at least one plaintiff, that &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/JuddLegum/status/1056938204731969538\"&gt;wasn’t the case at all&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Plaintiff Jane Doe is a resident of California who works as a hospice caregiver. In 2014, Doe attended a meeting for prospective ACN recruits. As she listened to the presentations, Doe was skeptical and unpersuaded. But then she saw a promotional video prominently featuring Trump. Trump’s endorsement was the turning point. . . . Doe had no idea Trump was being paid lavishly for his endorsement&amp;#8212;the video made no mention of that. Doe joined ACN then and there. Despite her limited resources, Doe wrote a check for the $499 registration fee, in reliance on Trump’s endorsement. In the two years that followed, Doe paid thousands of dollars in fees and expenses to attend ACN events and host ACN meetings in an effort to succeed with the business. But, ultimately, she had extremely limited success&amp;#8212;she earned a single check for $38.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In a statement, &lt;strong&gt;Alan Garten,&lt;/strong&gt; a lawyer for the Trump Organization, said the allegations in the suit are meritless and should be paid no attention because the plaintiffs’ attorney fees are being funded by a nonprofit whose chairman is a Democratic donor. “This is clearly just another effort by opponents of the President to use the court system to advance a political agenda,” he told the &lt;em&gt;Times.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Roberta Kaplan&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Andrew Celli Jr.,&lt;/strong&gt; two lawyers for the plaintiffs, said “the case is being brought now because it is ready now,” and, to be fair, this isn’t the first time Trump has been accused of fraud. “This case connects the dots at the Trump Organization and involves systematic fraud that spanned more than a decade, involved multiple Trump businesses and caused tremendous harm to thousands of hardworking Americans,” the attorneys said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you would like to receive the Levin Report in your inbox daily, &lt;a href=\"http://tinyletter.com/besslevin\"&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt; to subscribe.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If Elon Musk could turn back time . . .&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;He’d &lt;a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/29/teslas-elon-musk-says-his-tweet-that-led-to-a-20-million-fine-was-worth-it.html\"&gt;still&lt;/a&gt; send that tweet that got him sued by the Securities and Exchange Commission:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Tesla Chief Executive &lt;strong&gt;Elon Musk&lt;/strong&gt; said the tweet that cost him and the company $20 million in fines each by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission was “worth it.” . . . The Securities and Exchange Commission in September charged Musk, 47, with misleading investors with tweets on August 7 that said he was considering taking Tesla private at $420 a share and had secured funding. The tweets had no basis in fact, and the ensuing market chaos hurt investors, regulators claimed.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The settlement also dictated that Musk must step down as chairman of the company he founded, but apparently you can’t put a price &lt;a href=\"https://news.avclub.com/elon-musks-dumb-420-joke-might-be-coming-back-to-bite-h-1828408088\"&gt;on weed jokes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trump is thinking his trade war could use some more tariffs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Next month, Donald Trump will meet with Chinese President &lt;strong&gt;Xi Jinping&lt;/strong&gt; on the sidelines of a Group of 20 summit in Buenos Aires, where they’ll discuss the escalating trade war started by Trump earlier this year. So far, neither side has backed down, and despite Trump’s insistence that trade wars are “good” and “easy to win,” thus far U.S. companies and consumers have paid &lt;a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2018/07/30/after-trumps-farmer-bailout-manufacturers-ask-what-about-us/?utm_term=.9668a6be81e0\"&gt;a lopsided amount of the price&lt;/a&gt;, while the president’s “trade policies” might actually create jobs &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/26/business/china-jobs-automobiles-trade-war.html\"&gt;in China&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; So what President Jobs, Jobs, Jobs is thinking is this situation could be vastly improved by introducing more tariffs. &lt;a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-29/u-s-said-to-plan-more-china-tariffs-if-trump-xi-meeting-fails\"&gt;Per Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The U.S. is preparing to announce by early December tariffs on all remaining Chinese imports if talks next month between presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping fail to ease the trade war, three people familiar with the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;An early December announcement of a new product list would mean the effective date&amp;#8212;after a 60-day public-comment period&amp;#8212;may coincide with China’s Lunar New Year holiday in early February. The list would apply to the imports from the Asian nation that aren’t already covered by previous rounds of tariffs&amp;#8212;which may be $257 billion using last year’s import figures, according to two of the people.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Over the weekend, Trump told supporters in Indiana, “We’re in the middle of a pretty nasty dispute. . . . We’re in a trade dispute&amp;#8212;I want to use that word because it’s a nice, soft word&amp;#8212;but we’re going to win. You know why? ’Cause we always win.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;U.S. tax cuts working out exactly as corporate American said they would&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Which is to say, they’ve had little to no effect on most companies’ &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/TimJHanrahan/status/930481095988170757\"&gt;investment and hiring plans&lt;/a&gt;, in spite of the promises made by Republicans and the White House, &lt;a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e9bccd00-db98-11e8-8f50-cbae5495d92b\"&gt;according to a survey released today&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The National Association for Business Economics found buoyant conditions in the third quarter of 2018, with its members reporting rising sales and improved profit margins, but reported that the Republican tax reform “has not broadly impacted hiring and investment plans.” The survey, conducted between September 26 and October 11, adds to a growing body of evidence that much of the windfall from tax reform has been spent on share buybacks rather than investment, jobs, or research and development. Republicans had predicted their changes to the tax code would trigger a boom in corporate investment and hiring, particularly in the U.S. On the day he signed the bill into law, Mr Trump said: “It’s going to be a tremendous thing for the American people. It’s going to be fantastic for the economy. It’s going to keep companies from leaving our shores and opening up in other countries.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan will no longer require interns to commit to a lifetime of servitude at age 8&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Times, &lt;a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/goldman-jpmorgan-hit-pause-on-intern-recruiting-madness-1540819063\"&gt;they are a-changin’&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase &amp;amp; Co. won’t interview or extend summer internship offers to college sophomores this year and will go back to recruiting students in the fall of their junior year, executives said. It is a nod to a softer Wall Street, eager to cast off its sweatbox image to compete with perk-happy Silicon Valley. It is also an acknowledgment that a push in recent years to move up application deadlines isn’t bringing in the kinds of candidates banks need as they try to diversify their overwhelmingly white and male ranks.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Earlier timetables and “exploding” job offers that expire within a few days have ramped up the pressure on students to commit, said &lt;strong&gt;Amy Donegan,&lt;/strong&gt; an assistant dean at Boston College’s Carroll School of Management. “These are 19-year-old kids,” she said. “It’s really hard to tell them, ‘You can say no to that.’”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It’s unclear what impact the new policy will have on current junior employees who, at Goldman Sachs, are &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/09/populist-revolt-at-goldman-sachs-lloyd-blankfein-office\"&gt;said to be&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;this close&lt;/em&gt; to storming the C-suite and rioting over inhuman working conditions, like only getting $25 to spend on dinner each night.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elsewhere!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warren Buffett’s&lt;/strong&gt; Firm Invests Millions in Fintech (&lt;a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/warren-buffetts-firm-invests-millions-in-fintech-1540807200?mod=hp_lead_pos4\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;W.S.J.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin Could Theoretically Put Paris Climate Goals Out of Reach (&lt;a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-29/bitcoin-could-theoretically-put-paris-climate-goals-out-of-reach\"&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Sweden Is Going Cashless So Quickly That Its Central Bank Is Speeding Up Plans for a National Digital Currency (&lt;a href=\"http://fortune.com/2018/10/26/sweden-riksbank-e-krona/\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortune&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;How Blackstone Landed $20 Billion from Saudis for New Fund (&lt;a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-22/how-blackstone-landed-20-billion-from-saudis-for-infrastructure\"&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Business education: have we reached peak M.B.A. (&lt;a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d8ec7cd6-d153-11e8-a9f2-7574db66bcd5\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Authorities say they’ve captured a man suspected of dumping his grandson’s soiled diapers along several New Jersey roadways over the past year.

president also took another shot at the reporters covering his rally.","body":"&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/strong&gt; has once again positioned himself against the #MeToo movement, mocking it during his Wednesday night rally in Pennsylvania. While reminiscing on his victory in the state in the 2016 presidential election&amp;#8212;like an old high-school quarterback revisiting the field over and over&amp;#8212;Trump stopped himself from using a certain expression, blaming “the rules of MeToo.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;“Pennsylvania hasn’t been won for many years by Republicans, but every Republican thinks they’re going to win Pennsylvania,” he said, &lt;a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/10/politics/trump-rally-mocks-me-too/index.html\"&gt;according to CNN&lt;/a&gt;. “I used an expression&amp;#8212;you know, there’s an expression, but under the rules of MeToo I’m not allowed to use that expression anymore. I can’t do it.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;He said the expression is akin to “the person that got away. See, in the old days, it was a little different.” When an audience member encouraged him to “do it anyway,” Trump laughed and pointed to the news cameras. “I would do it, except for these people up there. They would say, did you hear what President Trump said?”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;He continued, saying, “So there is an expression, but we’ll change the expression: Pennsylvania was always the person who got away. That’s pretty good, right? The person that got away?”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It’s unclear what Trump thinks the “rules” of #MeToo are. The movement, started by activist &lt;strong&gt;Tarana Burke,&lt;/strong&gt; began as a way for survivors of sexual misconduct to voice their pain and show solidarity with fellow survivors. It has sprawled into something greater, tied to the broader societal reckoning over sexual misconduct that &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/10/a-year-without-harvey-weinstein-oscar-monster\"&gt;began a year ago&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8212;but the message at its core has remained the same.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Trump, who has been accused of sexual misconduct himself multiple times (he has denied the claims), has made his stance clear on the growing movement. He first insulted it in July: while referring to Senator &lt;strong&gt;Elizabeth Warren&lt;/strong&gt; of Massachusetts, whom he has taken to calling “Pocahontas” because of her Native American heritage, Trump said he would like to send an ancestry kit her way. “We’ll take that little kit and say&amp;#8212;we have to do it gently because we are in the MeToo generation&amp;#8212;and we will very gently take that kit, slowly toss it [to her],” he said.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Last week, Trump also &lt;a href=\"http://time.com/5412955/donald-trump-says-scary-time-men-sexual-assault-allegations/\"&gt;told reporters&lt;/a&gt; that “it is a very scary time for young men in America, where you can be guilty of something you may not be guilty of”&amp;#8212;referring to the scandal surrounding &lt;strong&gt;Brett Kavanaugh&lt;/strong&gt; (who has since been sworn into the Supreme Court, despite sexual assault allegations he denied). “This is a very, very&amp;#8212;this is a very difficult time. What’s happening here has much more to do than even the appointment of a Supreme Court justice.”&lt;/p&gt;","rubric":"#MeToo","socialTitle":"Trump Mocks #MeToo Movement Days After Decrying “a Scary

Following the arrest of  &lt;a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2018/10/26/who-is-cesar-altieri-sayoc-what-we-know-about-suspected-mail-bomber-arrested-florida/\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cesar Sayoc&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a Florida resident and ostensible &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/cesar-syoc-pipe-bomber-donald-trump\"&gt;Trump supporter&lt;/a&gt; who mailed bombs to Trump’s “adversaries” across the country, including CNN’s New York newsroom, &lt;strong&gt;Hillary Clinton,&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Barack Obama,&lt;/strong&gt; the president &lt;a href=\"https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-am-16b8d5ba-260f-4b94-8a38-c0920cc1a115.html\"&gt;called&lt;/a&gt; for Sayoc’s actions to “be prosecuted and punished to the fullest extent of the law.” He added, “Political violence must never, ever be allowed in America, and I will do everything in my power to stop it. In recent days, we’ve had a broader conversation about the tone and civility of our national dialogue. Everyone will benefit if we can end the politics of personal destruction. We must unify as a nation in peace, love, and in harmony.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It was a markedly different message than the one Trump had put forward earlier that day, when he seemed to suggest the bombs were a hoax to derail the G.O.P. in the midterms, &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/cesar-syoc-pipe-bomber-donald-trump\"&gt;tweeting&lt;/a&gt;, “Republicans are doing so well in early voting, and at the polls, and now this ‘Bomb’ stuff happens and the momentum greatly slows,” and placing “bomb” in scare quotes. But, per &lt;a href=\"https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-am-16b8d5ba-260f-4b94-8a38-c0920cc1a115.html\"&gt;Axios&lt;/a&gt;, the moment he caught wind that the crowd was in the mood for something else, he changed tack, pivoting hard to his greatest hits. When the crowd began chanting “CNN Sucks!” he reinforced their cheers. “We have seen an effort by the media in recent hours to use the sinister actions of one individual to score political points against me and the Republican Party,” he said. He also made sure to include his usual jabs in at “crooked” Hillary Clinton, although he noted that he would refrain from insulting Rep. &lt;strong&gt;Maxine Waters,&lt;/strong&gt; another of Sayoc’s targets, because he was “trying to be nice.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Despite rhetoric such as this, Trump has said he deserves no blame for Sayoc’s actions. “There’s no blame,” he &lt;a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-marine-one-departure-20/\"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; reporters while departing for Friday’s rally, adding, “Well, I think I’ve been toned down, if you want to know the truth. I could really tone it up. Because, as you know, the media has been extremely unfair to me and to the Republican Party.” Others disagree. “This week’s events have shown that President Trump’s lies, rhetoric, and attacks have consequences,” North Carolina Democratic Chair &lt;strong&gt;Wayne Goodwin&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/politics-government/election/article220486190.html\"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;em&gt;Charlotte Observer&lt;/em&gt; in a statement. But after a brief moment of reprieve, it seems the president has no intention of stemming the tide.&lt;/p&gt;","rubric":"Trump Rally","socialTitle":"Trump Comes This Close to Saying Something

president is only a liar if you use the actual definition of the word liar.","body":"&lt;p&gt;What does it mean to be a liar? According to the actual definition of the term, a liar is a person who tells lies, i.e. intentionally false statements. Using the word in a sentence, one might say, “The president is a liar who claimed Monday that the middle class would get a 10 percent tax cut before midterm elections, even though Congress won’t even meet again until after November 6.” Or, “The president was in liar-mode again this week as he tweeted that ‘criminals and unknown Middle Easterners’ were racing for the U.S.-Mexico border, even as he admitted ‘&lt;a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/412820-trump-on-caravan-theres-no-proof-of-anything\"&gt;there’s no proof of anything&lt;/a&gt;.’” Or, and we’re just spit-balling here, “The president proved himself, yet again, to be a bald-faced liar when he insisted he hadn’t licked all the donuts in the executive dining room before deciding to go with the Boston cream this morning.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Despite the fact that &lt;strong&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/strong&gt; has spent virtually every day of his presidency telling lies, the topic came up again this week in light of the fact that 1) his lies have &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/white-house-staff-can-barely-keep-up-with-trump-lies\"&gt;become&lt;/a&gt; exponentially &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/donald-trump-brazen-lies-migrant-caravan\"&gt;more brazen&lt;/a&gt;, and 2) his violent rhetoric &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/JohnBrennan/status/1055436953129246720\"&gt;arguably inspired&lt;/a&gt; some nutcase to mail bombs to prominent Democrats and members of the media, about whom the president habitually lies through his caps (in fact, on Thursday, he blamed the attempted acts of violence &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1055418269270716418\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;on&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the media). But according to 11-day White House communications director and &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/01/trump-is-the-least-racist-person-ever-insists-shortest-tenured-employee\"&gt;perpetual&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/08/anthony-scaramucci-this-week\"&gt;Trump&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/06/trump-detention-center-policy\"&gt;fluffer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Anthony Scaramucci,&lt;/strong&gt; the president isn’t actually a liar in the traditional&amp;#8212;or any&amp;#8212;sense of the word.

Yes, the president is lying. He’s doing it intentionally to incite certain people, which would include left-leaning journalists and most of the left-leaning politicians.” But the man alternatively known as “&lt;a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/07/31/gucci-scaramucci-paid-100000-appear-wall-street-sequel-according/\"&gt;Gucci Scaramucci&lt;/a&gt;” and “The Mooch” saved his best dazzling array of bullshit for Fox News, where he &lt;a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/anthony-scaramucci-trump-is-not-a-liar-as-previously-said-hes-an-intentional-liar-who-uses-a-methodology-of-mistruth/2018/10/25/8dc3fdc4-d879-11e8-a10f-b51546b10756_story.html\"&gt;told the hosts&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;“I didn’t really say the president was a liar. I said the president is using a methodology of mistruth to create that level of tension and anxiety. He’s like, pushing the mainstream media and the left, and he’s trying to galvanize his base, and it’s a media device.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;“They asked me if the president tells mistruths or lies. I said he does intentionally lie to create a dog whistle and create some atmospheric.s . . . So they go and put a little tagline, ‘Scaramucci calls president a liar.’ That’s not what I was doing.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To recap: the president does tell lies, but that doesn’t make him a liar&amp;#8212;it makes him a tactical genius who uses the “methodology of mistruth” as a “media device” to “create a dog whistle” and “some atmospherics.” But a &lt;em&gt;liar&lt;/em&gt; liar?

Trump Foundation, claiming that the charity “was little more than a checkbook for payments to not-for-profits from Mr. Trump or the Trump Organization.” Among the allegations regarding how the family charity misappropriated its funds was the fun detail about $10,000 being spent on a portrait of the president, which was later found on display at the sports bar at Trump’s Doral golf resort. But according to the president’s lawyer, that wasn’t actually a matter of fraud. &lt;a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-25/trump-charity-lawyer-defends-payments-against-self-dealing-claim\"&gt;Rather&lt;/a&gt; . . .&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;When Donald Trump offered to pay $10,000 from his personal charitable foundation for a six-foot oil portrait of himself, the future president only meant to “get the bidding started” during a 2014 auction at his Mar-a-Lago resort, his lawyer told a New York judge.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;“No one else bid,” attorney &lt;strong&gt;Alan Futerfas&lt;/strong&gt; said in a packed Manhattan courtroom on Thursday, so “he’s stuck with the painting.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;On the one hand, we totally buy that the only person who wanted a creepy six-foot-tall oil portrait of Donald Trump was Donald Trump. On the other hand, we &lt;em&gt;don’t&lt;/em&gt; buy that the president didn’t think it was totally reasonable to use his charity as a slush fund to buy paintings of himself.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google punishes senior executive accused of sexual misconduct by paying him $90 million&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Nice work if you can get it! Per &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/25/technology/google-sexual-harassment-andy-rubin.html\"&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Google gave &lt;strong&gt;Andy Rubin,&lt;/strong&gt; the creator of Android mobile software, a hero’s farewell when he left the company in October 2014.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;“I want to wish Andy all the best with what’s next,” &lt;strong&gt;Larry Page,&lt;/strong&gt; Google’s chief executive then, said in a public statement. “With Android he created something truly remarkable &amp;#8212; with a billion-plus happy users.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What Google did not make public was that an employee had accused Mr. Rubin of sexual misconduct. The woman, with whom Mr. Rubin had been having an extramarital relationship, said he coerced her into performing oral sex in a hotel room in 2013, according to two company executives with knowledge of the episode. Google investigated and concluded her claim was credible, said the people, who spoke on the condition that they not be named, citing confidentiality agreements. . . . Google could have fired Mr. Rubin and paid him little to nothing on the way out. Instead, the company handed him a $90 million exit package, paid in installments of about $2 million a month for four years, said two people with knowledge of the terms. The last payment is scheduled for next month.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In a statement, Rubin said that “The &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; story contains numerous inaccuracies about my employment at Google and wild exaggerations about my compensation.” A spokesperson for Google told the &lt;em&gt;Times:&lt;/em&gt; “We investigate and take action, including termination. In recent years, we’ve taken a particularly hard line on inappropriate conduct by people in positions of authority. We’re working hard to keep improving how we handle this type of behavior.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Newt Gingrich says the quiet part out loud&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"&gt;&lt;blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/marycjordan/status/1055592210689855488\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/marycjordan/status/1055592210689855488\"&gt;https://twitter.com/marycjordan/status/1055592210689855488&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elsewhere!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Fed Fires Warning Shot at Wall Street’s Riskier Loan Deals (&lt;a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-25/fed-fires-warning-shot-at-wall-street-s-riskier-loan-deals?srnd=premium\"&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Estate of Rap Group Wu Tang’s Ol’ Dirty Bastard Plans December Launch of O.D.B.

Saturday morning. The Squirrel Hill synagogue had been in the midst of its shabbat service, which began at 9:45 A.M., according to its Web site. The gunman, who was &lt;a href=\"https://pittsburgh.cbslocal.com/2018/10/27/heavy-police-presence-near-synagogue-in-squirrel-hill/\"&gt;described&lt;/a&gt; by CBS News’s Pittsburgh affiliate, KDKA, as a “heavy white male with a beard,” reportedly entered the synagogue and yelled “all Jews must die” before opening fire. The Squirrel Hill neighborhood has been urged to stay indoors.

And something has to be done.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Yet other of his remarks seemed to imply that little could have been done to prevent the shooting: “Look at the violence all over the world. The world is violent. The world is a violent world.” And in a classic example of “good guy with a gun” mentality, he added that “this has little to do with [gun control] if you take a look, if they had protection inside, the results would have been far better . . . if they had some kind of a protection inside the temple, maybe it could have been a very much different situation, but they didn’t. And he was able to do things that unfortunately he shouldn’t have been able to do.” (Former synagogue president &lt;strong&gt;Michael Eisenberg&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a

Anything Important: Administration Officials","promoHed":"U.S. Officials: Trump’s Phone Is Tapped, but He’s Too Dumb to Know Any Intel","dek":"The Russians are apparently listening in, too.","promoDek":"Look on the bright side, White House sources say.","body":"&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/strong&gt; propelled himself into the White House in large part by slamming his opponent for using a private server and potentially putting national security at risk, a transgression he claimed was grave enough to merit prison time. In fact, as recently as &lt;em&gt;yesterday,&lt;/em&gt; his supporters were &lt;a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/trump-supporters-chant-lock-her-rally-same-day-hillary-clinton-received-1186760\"&gt;chanting&lt;/a&gt;, “Lock her up” at a rally in Mosinee, Wisconsin, while they waited for their Lord and Savior to arrive. Strangely, though, no one has had anything to say about the fact that the president apparently makes a regular habit of using phones that have reportedly been compromised by Chinese and Russian intelligence sources, for the simple reason that he’s too damn lazy to follow protocol.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/24/us/politics/trump-phone-security.html\"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that when Trump isn’t screaming at the TV for four to six hours a day, he’s calling old friends and/or Fox News hosts to “gossip, gripe, or solicit their latest take on how he is doing.” This is a practice born out of long-standing habit&amp;#8212;at times, the president’s cadre of outside advisers has seemed to outnumber the ones who actually work in the White House. And it wouldn’t necessarily be an issue, if it weren’t for the fact that Chinese spies (and Russians, too) listen in on these conversations&amp;#8212;not because they’ve developed sophisticated technology to intercept the president’s chats, but because Trump is too stupid and stubborn to use the secure White House landline. Instead, per the &lt;em&gt;Times,&lt;/em&gt; he sometimes uses a “personal phone that is no different from hundreds of millions of iPhones in use around the world.” Even if he did use one of the two iPhones that have been altered by the National Security Agency to limit their vulnerabilities, it wouldn’t make much of a difference, as Trump reportedly refuses to adhere to even the basic precautionary measure of swapping the devices out every 30 days because it’s “inconvenient.” And the Chinese can hardly believe their good fortune.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Current and former officials said they have also determined that China is seeking to use what it is learning from the calls&amp;#8212;how Mr. Trump thinks, what arguments tend to sway him and to whom he is inclined to listen&amp;#8212;to keep a trade war with the United States from escalating further. In what amounts to a marriage of lobbying and espionage, the Chinese have pieced together a list of the people with whom Mr. Trump regularly speaks in hopes of using them to influence the president, the officials said.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Chinese have identified friends of both [&lt;strong&gt;Stephen Schwarzman&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Steve Wynn&lt;/strong&gt;] and others among the president’s regulars, and are now relying on Chinese businessmen and others with ties to Beijing to feed arguments to the friends of the Trump friends. The strategy is that those people will pass on what they are hearing, and that Beijing’s views will eventually be delivered to the president by trusted voices, the officials said. They added that the Trump friends were most likely unaware of any Chinese effort.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;On the bright side, administration officials worried that the president will divulge highly classified information are clinging to the fact that he’s probably too dumb to have picked up on anything important during his national security briefings:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Administration officials said Mr. Trump’s longtime paranoia about surveillance&amp;#8212;well before coming to the White House he believed that his phone conversations were often being recorded&amp;#8212;gave them some comfort that he was not disclosing classified information on the calls. They said they had further confidence he was not spilling secrets because he rarely digs into the details of the intelligence he is shown and is not well versed in the operational specifics of military or covert activities.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;On the other hand!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Mr. Trump is also famously indiscreet. In a May 2017 meeting in the Oval Office with Russian officials, he shared highly sensitive intelligence passed to the United States by Israel.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Trump, naturally, claimed on Thursday that the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;’s story was wrong without saying what, exactly, was wrong about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"&gt;&lt;blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1055412328571850753\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1055412328571850753\"&gt;https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1055412328571850753&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the Chinese couldn’t even be bothered to deny that they’re listening in on the president’s calls.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"&gt;&lt;blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/annafifield/status/1055370640977317888\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/annafifield/status/1055370640977317888\"&gt;https://twitter.com/annafifield/status/1055370640977317888&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;More Great Stories from &lt;em&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212; Uber wants to be the next Amazon; but it &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/uber-the-next-amazon-but-others-see-the-next-yahoo?inline\"&gt;could end up the next Yahoo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212; Meet the fake Saudi prince with a &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2018/10/he-actually-believes-he-is-khalid-the-odyssey-of-a-counterfeit-saudi-prince?inline\"&gt;30-year plan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212; We talked to the most &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/inside-yamam-top-secret-israeli-anti-terrorism-operation?inline\"&gt;elite counterterrorism unit in the world&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212; Why Michael Bloomberg’s massive donations might &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/michael-bloomberg-funds-democrats-in-2018?inline\"&gt;not actually help him be president&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212; &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/where-is-barack-obama-2018-midterms?inline\"&gt;Where is Obama?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Looking for more? &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/newsletters\"&gt;Sign up&lt;/a&gt; for our daily Hive newsletter and never miss a story.&lt;/p&gt;","rubric":"Espionage","socialTitle":"U.S. Officials: Trump’s Phone Is Tapped, but He’s Too Dumb to Know Any Intel","socialDescription":"Look on the bright side, White House sources say.","seoTitle":"The Chinese Are Spying on Trump’s Calls, but Don’t Worry, He’s Too Stupid to Reveal Anything Important: Administration Officials ","seoDescription":"The Russians are apparently listening in, too.

A visit by a sitting president in the wake of a devastating event is, of course, fairly standard and often welcomed&amp;#8212;&lt;strong&gt;Barack Obama,&lt;/strong&gt; for example, &lt;a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2012/12/16/167412995/transcript-president-obama-at-sandy-hook-prayer-vigil\"&gt;spoke&lt;/a&gt; at a vigil in Newtown, Connecticut, two days after the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary school, &lt;a href=\"https://www.ctpost.com/local/article/The-president-comes-to-comfort-Newtown-4122455.php\"&gt;comforting&lt;/a&gt; the families that had just suffered an unthinkable tragedy. In this case, however, things were a little different! On Monday, Mayor &lt;strong&gt;Bill Peduto&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/pittsburgh-mayor-sends-message-to-trump-do-not-come-during-funerals\"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; he had tried to “get a message out to the White House” that it would be better if the president stayed in Washington, while thousands of people signed signed &lt;a href=\"https://www.bendthearc.us/open_letter_to_president_trump\"&gt;a letter&lt;/a&gt; written by a Jewish group based in Pittsburgh telling Trump he wasn’t welcome. That probably had something to do with the fact that the president &lt;a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-pennsylvania-shooting-trump-remarks/trump-says-pittsburgh-shooting-has-little-to-do-with-gun-laws-idUSKCN1N10M3\"&gt;blamed the victims&lt;/a&gt; following the attack, insisting that the shooting had nothing to do with gun laws and that “If they had some kind of a protection inside the temple maybe it could have been a very much different situation.” That the president has refused to disavow white nationalist and anti-Semites, and, some say, &lt;a href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/radio/thecurrent/the-current-for-august-14-2017-1.4244057/trump-has-emboldened-white-nationalists-with-racist-policies-says-author-1.4246077\"&gt;emboldened&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/08/the-battle-that-erupted-in-charlottesville-is-far-from-over/567167/\"&gt;them&lt;/a&gt;, may also have been a contributing factor.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Trump has never been one to take a hint, and chose instead to ignore the pleas of a grieving community. That resulted, unsurprisingly, in &lt;a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/congressional-leaders-decline-to-join-trump-in-visit-to-pittsburgh-after-massacre/2018/10/30/34709010-dc4e-11e8-aa33-53bad9a881e8_story.html\"&gt;protests&lt;/a&gt;, at least one victim’s family refusing to meet with him, and dismay on the parts of local officials who said the community “didn’t think this was the time for a political photo shoot,” especially given “the divisive nature of [the president’s] rhetoric.” But as far as Trump is concerned, the visit was a rousing success! Because from his vantage point, he was treated with the deference and respect he thinks he deserves, and didn’t have to personally witness anyone telling him to GTFO, which &lt;a href=\"https://www.msnbc.com/the-last-word/watch/pittsburgh-protester-to-trump-you-re-the-one-who-can-stop-these-tragedies-1357612099574?v=railb&amp;amp;\"&gt;happened often

president did not give any formal remarks&amp;#8212;as you can see in the bizarre highlight reel produced by the White House above&amp;#8212;but if he had, presumably they’d involve the words,

Days after the 2016 election he agreed to pay $25 million &lt;a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/10/politics/trump-university-settlement-finalized-trnd/index.html\"&gt;to settle&lt;/a&gt; three lawsuits against Trump University, a smoke-and-mirrors operation that made University of Phoenix look like Stanford, where instructors were given a “playbook” that &lt;a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-trump-university-20160531-snap-story.html\"&gt;included&lt;/a&gt; the name of a TrumpU employee to call “if an Attorney General arrives on the scene.” Before that, the ex-beauty pageant owner was slapping his name on everything from &lt;a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-products-that-disappeared-list-2018-4\"&gt;steaks to mattresses to cologne to deodorant&lt;/a&gt; in exchange for lucrative licensing fees. In June, the New York attorney general &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/06/trump-foundation-lawsuit\"&gt;sued&lt;/a&gt; him alleging “persistently illegal conduct” related to the Donald J. Trump Foundation, charging that the charity served as “little more than a checkbook for payments to not-for-profits from Mr. Trump or the Trump Organization,” a suit &lt;strong&gt;Amanda Miller,&lt;/strong&gt; a spokeswoman for the Trump Organization, called “politics at its very worst.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In addition to a willingness to do anything to enrich himself&amp;#8212;like, for instance, &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/donald-trump-fred-trump-taxes\"&gt;(allegedly) dodging taxes for decades&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8212;we’ve yet to see evidence that the president of the United States cares about anyone not related to him by blood or marriage, or possesses the sort of moral compass that would prevent normal people from engaging in activity that hurts others. (According to &lt;em&gt;The New York Times,&lt;/em&gt; the Trump family &lt;a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/10/02/us/politics/donald-trump-tax-schemes-fred-trump.html\"&gt;created&lt;/a&gt; a company in 1992 that not only allowed the family to siphon millions to Trump, his siblings, and a cousin, but also let them pad invoices so they could raise the rent on low-income tenants who were supposed to be protected by rent regulations. In a statement, &lt;strong&gt;Charles Harder,&lt;/strong&gt; a lawyer for Trump, told the &lt;em&gt;Times:&lt;/em&gt; “There was no fraud or tax evasion by anyone” and that such affairs were “handled by other Trump family members.”) So, really, it shouldn’t come as a surprise in the slightest that the president and his three adult children have been &lt;a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/29/nyregion/trump-acn-lawsuit.html\"&gt;accused&lt;/a&gt; of pushing investment scams on thousands of vulnerable Americans in exchange for “lavish” payments they conveniently failed to mention in their sales pitches.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Filed in federal court in Manhattan on Monday . . . the 160-page complaint alleges that Mr. Trump and his family received secret payments from three business entities in exchange for promoting them as legitimate opportunities, when in reality they were get-rich-quick schemes that harmed investors, many of whom were unsophisticated and struggling financially.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Those business entities were ACN, a telecommunications marketing company that paid Mr. Trump millions of dollars to endorse its products; the Trump Network, a vitamin marketing enterprise; and the Trump Institute, which the suit said offered “extravagantly priced multiday training seminars” on Mr. Trump’s real estate “secrets.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The four plaintiffs, who were identified only with pseudonyms like Jane Doe, depict the Trump Organization as a racketeering enterprise that defrauded thousands of people for years as the president turned from construction to licensing his name for profit. The suit also names &lt;strong&gt;Donald Trump Jr., Ivanka Trump,&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Eric Trump&lt;/strong&gt; as defendants.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Back in 2011, &lt;em&gt;New York&lt;/em&gt;’s &lt;strong&gt;Jessica Pressler&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://nymag.com/nymag/features/70831/\"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; about the vitamin venture, which included products like “Prime Essentials” and “Custom Essentials,” a line of snacks for kids called “Snazzle Snaxxs,” a diet program called “Silhouette Solutions,” and a skincare line called “BioCé Cosmeceuticals.” Like Trump University, vitamin marketers were well-versed in what to do on the off-chance someone suggested Donald Trump would &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt; attach his name to something less than entirely legal:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The people at the Trump Network are trained to defend against allegations that it’s a pyramid scheme. Toward the end of Izzo’s seminar, we break into pairs to practice what to say when potential invitees suggest the business is a pyramid scheme. My partner is Billy, a former Wall Street trader who has worked his way up to “diamond director,” one of the highest levels in the company. The levels are determined by the number of people you recruit and the amount of products you and your downline purchase. “What’s a pyramid scheme?” he asks me. “Like the food pyramid? Like the Catholic Church? What about where you work? If you ask me, corporate America is a pyramid scheme. All the people on the top make all the money. The people at the bottom are spinning their wheels.” Then he plays his Trump card: “You think Donald Trump would involve himself in a pyramid scheme?”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In fact: yes! We do! We can also believe that Trump, a &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/white-house-staff-can-barely-keep-up-with-trump-lies\"&gt;known&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/the-mooch-trump-not-a-liar-just-a-connoisseur-of-mistruth\"&gt;liar&lt;/a&gt;, allegedly told people they’d make so much money from these scams that they’d be able to quit their day jobs. &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/JuddLegum/status/1056942139521810437\"&gt;Per the suit&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Trump doubled down on his claim during in-person endorsements, going so far as to suggest ACN was risk-free. Onstage at ACN’s International Convention in Barcelona, Spain, in March 2011, Trump explained to the auditorium that: “A lot of the [ACN] people that I’ve met had their job for two or three years, and all of a sudden they started leaving out of their job and going full-time at ACN because they’re making more money with ACN. So I like it because it really takes the risk out. It takes a lot of the risk out of the decision.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Of course, for at least one plaintiff, that &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/JuddLegum/status/1056938204731969538\"&gt;wasn’t the case at all&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Plaintiff Jane Doe is a resident of California who works as a hospice caregiver. In 2014, Doe attended a meeting for prospective ACN recruits. As she listened to the presentations, Doe was skeptical and unpersuaded. But then she saw a promotional video prominently featuring Trump. Trump’s endorsement was the turning point. . . . Doe had no idea Trump was being paid lavishly for his endorsement&amp;#8212;the video made no mention of that. Doe joined ACN then and there. Despite her limited resources, Doe wrote a check for the $499 registration fee, in reliance on Trump’s endorsement. In the two years that followed, Doe paid thousands of dollars in fees and expenses to attend ACN events and host ACN meetings in an effort to succeed with the business. But, ultimately, she had extremely limited success&amp;#8212;she earned a single check for $38.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In a statement, &lt;strong&gt;Alan Garten,&lt;/strong&gt; a lawyer for the Trump Organization, said the allegations in the suit are meritless and should be paid no attention because the plaintiffs’ attorney fees are being funded by a nonprofit whose chairman is a Democratic donor. “This is clearly just another effort by opponents of the President to use the court system to advance a political agenda,” he told the &lt;em&gt;Times.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Roberta Kaplan&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Andrew Celli Jr.,&lt;/strong&gt; two lawyers for the plaintiffs, said “the case is being brought now because it is ready now,” and, to be fair, this isn’t the first time Trump has been accused of fraud. “This case connects the dots at the Trump Organization and involves systematic fraud that spanned more than a decade, involved multiple Trump businesses and caused tremendous harm to thousands of hardworking Americans,” the attorneys said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you would like to receive the Levin Report in your inbox daily, &lt;a href=\"http://tinyletter.com/besslevin\"&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt; to subscribe.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If Elon Musk could turn back time . . .&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;He’d &lt;a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/29/teslas-elon-musk-says-his-tweet-that-led-to-a-20-million-fine-was-worth-it.html\"&gt;still&lt;/a&gt; send that tweet that got him sued by the Securities and Exchange Commission:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Tesla Chief Executive &lt;strong&gt;Elon Musk&lt;/strong&gt; said the tweet that cost him and the company $20 million in fines each by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission was “worth it.” . . . The Securities and Exchange Commission in September charged Musk, 47, with misleading investors with tweets on August 7 that said he was considering taking Tesla private at $420 a share and had secured funding. The tweets had no basis in fact, and the ensuing market chaos hurt investors, regulators claimed.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The settlement also dictated that Musk must step down as chairman of the company he founded, but apparently you can’t put a price &lt;a href=\"https://news.avclub.com/elon-musks-dumb-420-joke-might-be-coming-back-to-bite-h-1828408088\"&gt;on weed jokes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trump is thinking his trade war could use some more tariffs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Next month, Donald Trump will meet with Chinese President &lt;strong&gt;Xi Jinping&lt;/strong&gt; on the sidelines of a Group of 20 summit in Buenos Aires, where they’ll discuss the escalating trade war started by Trump earlier this year. So far, neither side has backed down, and despite Trump’s insistence that trade wars are “good” and “easy to win,” thus far U.S. companies and consumers have paid &lt;a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2018/07/30/after-trumps-farmer-bailout-manufacturers-ask-what-about-us/?utm_term=.9668a6be81e0\"&gt;a lopsided amount of the price&lt;/a&gt;, while the president’s “trade policies” might actually create jobs &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/26/business/china-jobs-automobiles-trade-war.html\"&gt;in China&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; So what President Jobs, Jobs, Jobs is thinking is this situation could be vastly improved by introducing more tariffs. &lt;a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-29/u-s-said-to-plan-more-china-tariffs-if-trump-xi-meeting-fails\"&gt;Per Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The U.S. is preparing to announce by early December tariffs on all remaining Chinese imports if talks next month between presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping fail to ease the trade war, three people familiar with the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;An early December announcement of a new product list would mean the effective date&amp;#8212;after a 60-day public-comment period&amp;#8212;may coincide with China’s Lunar New Year holiday in early February. The list would apply to the imports from the Asian nation that aren’t already covered by previous rounds of tariffs&amp;#8212;which may be $257 billion using last year’s import figures, according to two of the people.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Over the weekend, Trump told supporters in Indiana, “We’re in the middle of a pretty nasty dispute. . . . We’re in a trade dispute&amp;#8212;I want to use that word because it’s a nice, soft word&amp;#8212;but we’re going to win. You know why? ’Cause we always win.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;U.S. tax cuts working out exactly as corporate American said they would&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Which is to say, they’ve had little to no effect on most companies’ &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/TimJHanrahan/status/930481095988170757\"&gt;investment and hiring plans&lt;/a&gt;, in spite of the promises made by Republicans and the White House, &lt;a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e9bccd00-db98-11e8-8f50-cbae5495d92b\"&gt;according to a survey released today&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The National Association for Business Economics found buoyant conditions in the third quarter of 2018, with its members reporting rising sales and improved profit margins, but reported that the Republican tax reform “has not broadly impacted hiring and investment plans.” The survey, conducted between September 26 and October 11, adds to a growing body of evidence that much of the windfall from tax reform has been spent on share buybacks rather than investment, jobs, or research and development. Republicans had predicted their changes to the tax code would trigger a boom in corporate investment and hiring, particularly in the U.S. On the day he signed the bill into law, Mr Trump said: “It’s going to be a tremendous thing for the American people. It’s going to be fantastic for the economy. It’s going to keep companies from leaving our shores and opening up in other countries.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan will no longer require interns to commit to a lifetime of servitude at age 8&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Times, &lt;a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/goldman-jpmorgan-hit-pause-on-intern-recruiting-madness-1540819063\"&gt;they are a-changin’&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase &amp;amp; Co. won’t interview or extend summer internship offers to college sophomores this year and will go back to recruiting students in the fall of their junior year, executives said. It is a nod to a softer Wall Street, eager to cast off its sweatbox image to compete with perk-happy Silicon Valley.

diligence to see if a presidential visit could be tolerated.","body":"&lt;section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday afternoon, &lt;strong&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/strong&gt; decamped to Pittsburgh in order to personally pay his respect to the 11 people slain in the horrific mass shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue. Joined by &lt;strong&gt;Melania Trump, Jared Kushner, Ivanka Trump,&lt;/strong&gt; and Treasury Secretary &lt;strong&gt;Steve Mnuchin,&lt;/strong&gt; his tribute, on some level, appeared to follow the traditional presidential protocol for honoring the memory of Americans tragically felled by an ungodly act of terror or natural disaster. Inside the synagogue, the president listened to the congregation’s rabbi as he detailed what happened over the weekend. Trump and the First Lady lit a candle for each victim. He lay stones and flowers from the White House gardens on memorials set up outside Tree of Life before traveling to a local hospital where survivors of the shooting were being treated.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But the usual, solemn role of the president as comforter in chief played out much different this week. President Trump made no public speech. No state or national political leaders joined him, despite his invitations. (Both &lt;strong&gt;Paul Ryan&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Mitch McConnell&lt;/strong&gt; cited scheduling conflicts, as did Pennsylvania’s Republican senator, &lt;strong&gt;Pat Toomey.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Nancy Pelosi&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Chuck Schumer&lt;/strong&gt; also turned down an invitation.) In fact, local officials asked the president to postpone. Pittsburgh Mayor &lt;strong&gt;Bill Peduto&lt;/strong&gt; had explicitly asked Trump not to come on Tuesday. He suggested that the president delay his visit until after the funerals, so as not to divert resources from overseeing a collective mourning and the sort of security measures required after an act of domestic terrorism. “We do not have enough public safety officials to provide enough protection at the funerals and . . . at the same time draw attention to a potential presidential visit,” he said on Monday. “All attention should be on the victims.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tom Wolf,&lt;/strong&gt; Pennsylvania’s Democratic governor, who is up for re-election next week, asked advisers about whether or not to attend, according to three people who spoke with him. “It wasn’t about partisan politics,” one of these people said. “The meeting was so ill-timed and about [Trump’s] narcissism. He could have listened to what the mayor said, come in three days when people weren’t literally being buried, and sat Shiva privately with the families without taking away attention and resources. So the decision was how do these politicians&amp;#8212;from both sides, by the way&amp;#8212;not upset a head of state, but, more importantly, not upset the community. They sort of decided to just politely not show up.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, thousands of community members were hoping he wouldn’t come at all, unless and until Trump was willing to denounce the sort of hateful rhetoric that he has condoned since he began campaigning more than three years ago. By the time Trump touched down in Pittsburgh, more than 70,000 people had signed an open letter &lt;a href=\"https://www.bendthearc.us/open_letter_to_president_trump\"&gt;composed by Bend the Arc&lt;/a&gt;, a local progressive Jewish group, declaring that Trump would not be welcomed in the city until he denounced white nationalism and stopped “targeting” minorities in his bombast and policies. Trump has faced criticism from members of the Jewish community for years. In the summer of 2016, after he re-tweeted an anti-Semitic image featuring &lt;strong&gt;Hillary Clinton,&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;New York Observer&lt;/em&gt; writer &lt;strong&gt;Dana Schwartz&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://observer.com/2016/07/an-open-letter-to-jared-kushner-from-one-of-your-jewish-employees/\"&gt;lambasted&lt;/a&gt; Trump for what she called “a winking promise to this nation’s worst and most hateful individuals,” calling on Kushner, who owned the paper and whose paternal grandparents were Holocaust survivors, to take a stand. (Kushner responded in an op-ed defending his father-in-law.) Last summer, the president sent chills through the community after his equivocal “both sides” response to the neo-Nazi uprising in Charlottesville, which nearly led then-national economic adviser &lt;strong&gt;Gary Cohn&lt;/strong&gt; to resign. The Tree of Life shooter, himself, &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/gab-alt-right-platform-tree-of-life-synagogue-shooting\"&gt;invoked #MAGA&lt;/a&gt; before undertaking his heinous atrocity.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As Trump made his first stop on Tuesday, hundreds of people were somberly walking through the surrounding streets in protest of his visit. They sang Hebrew prayers and carried signs that read “No Hate, No Guns, No Trump,” “Make America Kind Again,” and “Trump sows hate.” As he made his way into Tree of Life, the press pool could make out protesters from blocks away yelling “words have meaning” and “no more hate” for the president to hear.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;“It was super powerful,” Pennsylvania’s attorney general, &lt;strong&gt;Josh Shapiro,&lt;/strong&gt; a Democrat who had spent the last few days on the ground in the community, told me on Tuesday evening. “The community was out in force because they were trying to show love, and because they were angry by the president’s words and deeds.” He added: “His presence ultimately distracted everyone from what today was supposed to be about&amp;#8212;honoring these lives and the solemn burying practices.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Behind the scenes, however, numerous forces in the White House were intent on making the visit happen. Kushner and Ivanka Trump were eager for it. The president, too, was keen on making the stop, though he was anxious to continue his busy campaign schedule ahead of the midterm elections. So as Pittsburgh coped with the tragedy, Trump’s staff quietly conducted considerable due diligence to see if a presidential visit could be executed with minimal distraction&amp;#8212;to honor the dead without invoking the rage of the protesters.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;According to people familiar with the situation, staffers were going back and forth on the topic over the weekend. &lt;strong&gt;Jason Greenblatt&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Avi Berkowitz,&lt;/strong&gt; who work closely with Kushner, were dispatched to Pittsburgh on Sunday to attend public events as the faces of the administration. Privately, they stopped by area schools and spoke to local leaders and community members to take the temperature about how a presidential visit would be perceived. As part of the process, Kushner was involved in the details of the visit coming together, including joining advance calls to set up what the president might do when he did visit. On Monday, Press Secretary &lt;strong&gt;Sarah Huckabee Sanders&lt;/strong&gt; announced that Tree of Life’s rabbi, &lt;strong&gt;Jeffrey Myers,&lt;/strong&gt; had given them permission to attend, a significant endorsement that would facilitate the trip. Myers said in interviews that the president would be welcomed “as an American,” and as the president. “I chose to take the polite and respectful path.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But even after Myers’s approval, the community was divided on the decision. On one hand, according to people in the community, there was good reason to oppose the president’s visit, particularly on this day. “There are many people who feel that the president has ramped up rhetoric that makes it acceptable to preach hate and give protection to speech like that,” one member of the community, who spoke on the condition on anonymity to talk more freely, said. “There are many people who feel like until he absolutely renounces white nationalism, he is not welcome.” (On Monday night, as the synagogue massacre roiled the Pittsburgh community, Trump doubled down on referring to himself as a nationalist during an interview with Fox News&amp;#8212;a term he has said is wholly different from white nationalism.)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, some felt that out of respect for the office Trump holds, they should allow him to pay his respects. “Clearly, politically speaking,” according to this member of the community, “he was not welcome, but we’ll all suck it up because he is the president of the United States.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It is this divide that explains why the administration acted with caution, recognizing the fragile nature of the situation. Up until Tuesday morning, White House officials handling the trip were making calls to people in the local community to double and, in some cases, triple check that the trip would not capsize, according to people who received the calls and others familiar with them.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;After the trip’s conclusion, Sanders put a familiar spin on it. The widow of one of the victims, Dr. Richard Gottfried, had wanted Trump there, and wanted people to know it, Sanders told reporters aboard Air Force One as they made their way back to Washington. Asked why Trump did not wait to come on a different day, as some local officials had requested, Sanders said “he was also asked to come by some. The president wanted to show his respect on behalf of the entire country and to represent the country in this moment.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Trump himself could not resist the impulse to make a visit meant to honor the victims of a tragedy about himself and his performance. Nor could he resist tweaking the media for highlighting those who gathered to object to his presence. “Melania and I were treated very nicely yesterday in Pittsburgh. The Office of the President was shown great respect on a very sad &amp;amp; solemn day. We were treated so warmly,” he &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1057620518751428608\"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter on Wednesday morning, appending his remarks to a slickly produced White House highlight reel of the trip. “Small protest was not seen by us, staged far away. The Fake News stories were just the opposite-Disgraceful!” Later in the day, he would resume his tour of battleground states. Tree of Life will continue to bury its dead.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;More Great Stories from &lt;em&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212; Why Fox doesn’t have much of a choice &lt;a

And as the Khashoggi affair has played out, disappointment has morphed to cynicism within the diplomatic community.","body":"&lt;section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only surprise about &lt;strong&gt;Donald Trump’s&lt;/strong&gt; response to the death of Jamal Khashoggi, &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; columnist who was killed and dismembered inside the Saudi consulate earlier this month, was how little Trump pretended to care. For decades, a succession of U.S. presidents have disguised the brutal realpolitik of America’s relationship with Saudi Arabia under a patina of moral superiority and willful ignorance. Trump dispatched with the illusion entirely. “This took place in Turkey, and to the best of our knowledge, Khashoggi is not a United States citizen,” he told reporters, computing the value of Khashoggi’s life in real time. “He’s a permanent resident.” On the phone with Fox News, when asked about the possibility of canceling an arms deal with Riyadh, Trump was similarly forthright regarding the hard economic calculus. “I think that would be hurting us,” he said. “We have jobs. We have a lot of things happening in this country.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Inside Washington, foreign-policy experts hoping for a reset swiftly downgraded their expectations. And as the Khashoggi affair has played out, disappointment has morphed to cynicism within the diplomatic community. “It’s fairly clear that this administration is hoping this will blow over in some respect or another,” &lt;strong&gt;Peter Juul,&lt;/strong&gt; a senior policy analyst at the Center for American Progress, sighed in an interview. On Tuesday, Secretary of State &lt;strong&gt;Mike Pompeo&lt;/strong&gt; had made a perfunctory concession to critics by revoking the visas for some of the Saudi officials linked to Khashoggi’s death. But it was largely an empty gesture&amp;#8212;18 of the 21 Saudi suspects were already under arrest, and likely fated to die in a Saudi prison. (At least one of the men involved in the “hit team” had already [died in a mysterious &lt;a href=\"https://nypost.com/2018/10/18/saudi-who-arrived-in-turkey-day-of-khashoggi-disappearance-dies-in-traffic-accident/\"&gt;“traffic accident”&lt;/a&gt; upon returning to Riyadh.) “This was a perfect moment for Trump to step out and say, ‘We Americans reject this, because we believe in what we believe,” former U.S. ambassador &lt;strong&gt;Nicholas Burns,&lt;/strong&gt; said, incensed. “He missed it, because he doesn’t think about these things . . . I think we’re seeing the hollowness of his presidency. Truly. There’s no moral center to it.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Notably, many are sympathetic to the bind the Trump administration has found itself in. “To be fair, any administration of either party&amp;#8212;Trump, Obama, Bush, Clinton&amp;#8212;would have found this challenging,” Burns told me. “I don’t think there’s anybody out there, a senior person who’s worked in government, saying we should end our relationship with Saudi Arabia over this.” After all, Saudi Arabia is a critical U.S. ally&amp;#8212;from both a strategic and economic standpoint. The Saudis serve as an imperfect ally of Israel, and are seen as a check on Iranian hegemony in the Middle East. “To be honest, when it comes to tangible policy, another administration may not have been all that different than Trump,” &lt;strong&gt;John Glaser,&lt;/strong&gt; the director of foreign policy at the Cato Institute, told me. “A typical administration would almost certainly have been more critical of the Saudis following the Khashoggi murder, but probably gently so. With the exception of some symbolic penalties&amp;#8212;formal condemnations, calls for investigation, possibly a temporary suspension of arms sales&amp;#8212;the U.S.-Saudi relationship would probably not be fundamentally altered.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It is too early to tell whether Khashoggi’s murder has brought the U.S. establishment to a tipping point. Over the past weeks, both Republican and Democratic lawmakers have voiced frustration with Saudi Arabia, its war in Yemen, and the Saudi regime’s apparent disregard for America’s multi-billion-dollar patronage. But Washington is also awash in Saudi money, which funds dozens of think tanks, P.R. and consulting firms, and provides sinecures for all manner of Swamp creatures. The Trump administration, certainly, has yet to telegraph any interest in altering its relationship with Riyadh, let alone with Crown Prince &lt;strong&gt;Mohammed bin Salman,&lt;/strong&gt; who has a close personal connection with &lt;strong&gt;Jared Kushner.&lt;/strong&gt; If there was a window for Trump to exert his leverage over Saudi Arabia&amp;#8212;a desert economy with a singular, but depleting, natural resource&amp;#8212;he missed the opportunity. Nor did he bother to engage with the European Union or NATO allies, as past administrations likely would have done, signaling the extent to which “America First” has also come to mean “America Alone.” Meanwhile, Juul lamented, the Saudis are “very much all in on Trump. They’re trying to see what they can get away with in however long he’s in office. They’re trying to run the table.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thomas Lippman,&lt;/strong&gt; who served as the Middle East bureau chief for &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post,&lt;/em&gt; put it more succinctly. “The crown prince is clearly going to brazen it out. There is not going to be any fundamental rupture in relations between Saudi Arabia and the United States,” he said. “I am not saying that people are not upset about it. I am saying that on the scale of grievances that Saudi Arabia and the United States have had over the past 75 years, this too shall pass.” Lippman, the author of &lt;em&gt;Saudi Arabia on the Edge&lt;/em&gt;, noted with dismay the limits of America’s historical memory, and the sins that are excused in the name of global stability. “Nothing that happened to Jamal Khashoggi is in the same ballpark as the death of the collective outrage in the United States over 9/11. And it did not lead to even a temporary rupture of economic and strategic relations with Saudi Arabia.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the White House attempts to move on, the diplomatic community has turned to Congress. “I think if there’s going to be any movement on it, it’s going to come from Congress,” Juul said. Outrage on Capitol Hill quickly eclipsed the White House’s glacial response as grisly details of Khashoggi’s death became public in the week since Khashoggi disappeared inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on October 2. “We deal with bad people all the time, but this is in our face,” South Carolina Senator &lt;strong&gt;Lindsey Graham,&lt;/strong&gt; a traditionally staunch defender of the U.S.-Saudi relationship, said during an interview with &lt;em&gt;Fox &amp;amp; Friends,&lt;/em&gt; urging the president to “sanction the hell out of Saudi Arabia.” Such indignation spans the aisle. As one congressional aide &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/mike-pompeo-jamal-khashoggi-saudi-arabia\"&gt;told me&lt;/a&gt; last week, “Across the Hill, there is just absolute disgust at what seems to have taken place.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What Congress will do, if anything, remains unclear. Sending a strong bipartisan message to the White House, 22 senators released a letter that triggered the Global Magnitsky Act, requiring the administration to open an investigation into the circumstances surrounding Khashoggi’s murder and issue a report on whether it will sanction the individuals involved. But Congress cannot force Trump to sanction anyone under the act. “All they can do is call for a report from the executive, and kind of potentially embarrass the executive if they choose not to impose those sanctions,” said &lt;strong&gt;Jarrett Blanc,&lt;/strong&gt; a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment who previously served in the State Department. “That is certainly what they are doing so far.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There are other areas, however, where Congress has greater leverage. For instance, any future U.S. arms deals with the Saudis will require congressional sign-off, and lawmakers have broad authority over funding U.S. involvement in Saudi Arabia’s war in Yemen. “We could, bluntly, really end their war, depending on how far we want to push in terms of the different kinds of support that we provide, and not providing it,” Blanc said. “They could radically change policy in that area if they choose to.” To that end, a bipartisan group of lawmakers led by Congressman &lt;strong&gt;Jim McGovern&lt;/strong&gt; have introduced a bill that would ban all arms sales and military cooperation with Saudi Arabia, effectively ending U.S. support for the war in Yemen. Last week, Senator &lt;strong&gt;Jack Reed,&lt;/strong&gt; the ranking Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said the U.S. should block all offensive arms sales to Saudi Arabia and that the U.S. military should stop refueling Saudi aircraft fighting in Yemen.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Criticizing the war in Yemen, a proxy battle with Iran, is not necessarily new ground for some members of Congress, but the Khashoggi affair could catalyze change. As a second Congressional aide explained to me, “There is a sort of backlash around this&amp;#8212;based on the media coverage and, sort of, the interest in Congress&amp;#8212;that is unusual, and would seem to be sort of pushing the needle a little bit, maybe.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But with Congress on recess until after the November midterms, there is a concern that any momentum could fade. “The timing is unfortunate. The lame duck is unfortunate,” the second Congressional aide said. “But I do think that the level of public pressure on the administration is important. Hopefully, if for no other reason than it’s the right thing to do. People should be outraged about this.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For now, the White House is stuck with Mohammed bin Salman, a monster of its own making. “He has been really successful in doing one thing, I think that may be his only real success. He has eliminated all competition and gave no other alternative to himself,” &lt;strong&gt;Ali Al-Ahmed,&lt;/strong&gt; a Saudi dissident and founder and director of the Institute for Gulf Affairs, told me. “That is reality. You like him or not, that is a fact. There is no one.” The big question for the Trump administration is what will its relationship with Saudi Arabia look like moving forward, knowing that M.B.S. isn’t going anywhere anytime soon. “That is, to me, the long-term question we have to ask ourselves,” a former high-ranking State Department official told me. “Regardless of how this story plays out, regardless of how the narrative eventually evolves. Do we have a partner in Saudi Arabia on whom we can depend to conduct himself and the affairs of his nation in that mature, thoughtful, careful way?”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;","rubric":"Foreign Policy","socialTitle":"“They’re Trying to Run the Table”: Experts Fear the Saudis Have Steamrolled Trump","socialDescription":"Inside Washington, foreign-policy experts hoping for a reset swiftly downgraded their expectations.

But the blowback could be bigger.","body":"&lt;p&gt;For the better part of a remarkable week in Washington, &lt;strong&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/strong&gt; seemed uncharacteristically removed from the action, floating above it all, almost Reaganesque. &lt;strong&gt;Brett Kavanaugh,&lt;/strong&gt; Trump &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/09/kavanaugh-allegations-trump-ivanka\"&gt;complained&lt;/a&gt; offstage, was a Bush guy. His bid to save his nomination on Fox, where he portrayed himself as something of a choirboy, the president viewed as limp. He liked Kavanaugh’s pugilism at last Friday’s hearing, but he was taken aback by all the talk of beer. “I watched that hearing, and I watched a man saying that he did have difficulty as a young man with drink,” Trump told reporters. A few hours later, he was back to praising &lt;strong&gt;Christine Blasey Ford&lt;/strong&gt; and taking a wait-and-see approach&amp;#8212;he wasn’t about to expend political capital saving Kavanaugh’s apparently sinking nomination. And, he couldn’t help mentioning, he himself had never had even one beer, being a teetotaler.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Trump’s &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/donald-trump-attacks-christine-ford-brett-kavanaugh\"&gt;mocking&lt;/a&gt; of Dr. Ford from the rally stage in Mississippi on Tuesday night seemed a characteristically undisciplined outburst, a reversion to form, and it drew rebukes from key Republican senators who would decide Kavanaugh’s fate. But it was probably a result of an evolving calculation of the political forces that, more than the nomination, would shape the midterms. Advisers including Deputy Chief of Staff &lt;strong&gt;Bill Shine&lt;/strong&gt; and outside allies &lt;strong&gt;Corey Lewandowski&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;David Bossie&lt;/strong&gt; had been imploring Trump to get more aggressive on behalf of his Supreme Court nominee, sources said. “Defending Kavanaugh is a culture-war issue for Republicans that divides and splits the Democrats,” one Republican close to the White House said. “The problem has always been: how do we turn out the G.O.P. base?”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Kavanaugh, the West Wing realized, was a wedge issue, tailor-made for the struggle at hand, and by the end of the week, after a hamstrung F.B.I. investigation gave Republicans enough cover, Trump went all in. At a rally in Minnesota on Thursday night, Trump told supporters, “Democrats have been trying to destroy Judge Brett Kavanaugh since the very first second he was announced.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;According to sources, Trump advisers feel they’ve found a winning message that will help them hold the Senate and, in what might be magical thinking, keep the House. “It’s a political issue, and he’s going to take it to the next level. That’s how you get the G.O.P. base, which is 60-plus percent white male, to vote,” the Republican close to the White House said. Trump hinted at this strategy on Thursday night. “All you have to do is look at the polls over the last three or four days, and it shows that their rage-fueled resistance is starting to backfire at a level that nobody has ever seen before,” he told rally goers.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Advisers say Trump’s mood has improved significantly this week, which in raw political terms, has been one of the best of his presidency. He scored big wins with a new Canada-Mexico trade deal and 3.7 percent unemployment numbers. “His optimism is very high,” one former West Wing official said. “I’m seeing it in the polling&amp;#8212;there’s electricity in the air for Republicans,” said another former West Wing official. (One minor annoyance: Kavanaugh’s &lt;a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/i-am-an-independent-impartial-judge-1538695822\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; op-ed. “Trump thought it was too apologetic,” said one outside adviser to the White House.)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But as good as this week was for Trump, investing his political future in a deeply unpopular judge who’s been credibly accused of sexual assault is a sign of the relativity of expectations in Trumpworld. “Folks are just focused on surviving,” one prominent Republican said.&lt;/p&gt;","rubric":"White House","socialTitle":"“Folks Are Just Focused on Surviving”: Trump Bets on Kavanaugh to Save the G.O.P.","socialDescription":"Blasting Christine Blasey Ford was a calculated move to stir the passions of his base.

Turkish security officials &lt;a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/09/world/europe/jamal-khashoggi-turkey-saudi-arabia.html\"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; that they believe he was “dismembered . . . with a bone saw” by a 15-person team, dispatched from Saudi Arabia to make the vociferous critic of Salman’s government disappear. It is, in other words, not a good look for the so-called “reformer” prince, whose country has &lt;a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/10/saudi-arabia-denies-killing-kashoggi-turkey-consulate-181007151205783.html\"&gt;denied&lt;/a&gt; killing Khashoggi, but is &lt;a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/saudi-story-about-journalist-jamal-khashoggi-doesnt-hold-up-says-bob-corker-everything-points-to-murde\"&gt;not trying particularly hard&lt;/a&gt; to be convincing. Nor is it a good look for &lt;strong&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Jared Kushner,&lt;/strong&gt; who don’t seem eager to terminate a chummy relationship with the crown prince over a credible murder allegation. At least not just yet.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For those who need a quick refresher on the Kushner-M.B.S. bromance, the two first bonded over lunch at the White House back in March 2017, with the Boy Prince of New Jersey subsequently persuading his father-in-law to visit Riyadh for his first trip abroad as president. From there, it was basically a buddy comedy for the ages, with Kushner championing M.B.S. when the young prince was battling with his cousin to become his father’s heir; supporting his move to blockade Qatar and tacitly supporting his brutal war in Yemen; having back-slapping dinners with the prince in D.C. and the Saudi capital; and &lt;a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2018/03/21/jared-kushner-saudi-crown-prince-mohammed-bin-salman/\"&gt;reportedly&lt;/a&gt; giving M.B.S. the names of disloyal Saudi royals who were later rounded up and imprisoned (Kushner denies this). Perhaps most significant, the two struck a deal for a $110 billion weapons sale&amp;#8212;not a bad inducement if you’re trying to get the future king’s blessing for your Israeli-Palestinian peace plan. Salman’s financial ties to Trump run deep, too. In March, the prince’s entourage almost single-handedly &lt;a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/at-president-trumps-hotel-in-new-york-revenue-went-up-this-spring--thanks-to-a-visit-from-big-spending-saudis/2018/08/03/58755392-9112-11e8-bcd5-9d911c784c38_story.html\"&gt;boosted&lt;/a&gt; revenue at Trump’s New York hotel by 13 percent. Presumably, Kushner and M.B.S. had discussed plans to get a boys trip on the calendar in between work and family commitments.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So the news that Saudi Arabia likely murdered a journalist who spoke critically of the crown prince’s regime has put Kushner in, as the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/10/us/politics/jamal-khashoggi-disappearance-kushner.html\"&gt;puts it&lt;/a&gt;, an “extremely awkward position”! At first, Kushner and the White House chose to stay silent on the matter, like friends of &lt;strong&gt;Brett Kavanaugh&lt;/strong&gt; refusing to dignify allegations of their pal being a fall-down drunk with a sexual-predator problem. But as the evidence kept piling up, it was clear they had to at least feign some level of concern, which apparently involved calling up M.B.S. and being like, “Hey, did you kill this guy? Nope? O.K., works for us!”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, the White House said, Mr. Kushner and &lt;strong&gt;John R. Bolton,&lt;/strong&gt; the national security adviser, spoke to Prince Mohammed by phone about Mr. Khashoggi’s disappearance. Secretary of State &lt;strong&gt;Mike Pompeo&lt;/strong&gt; also called him.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;“In both calls, they asked for more details and for the Saudi government to be transparent in the investigation process,” said the White House press secretary, &lt;strong&gt;Sarah Huckabee Sanders.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Kushner’s father-in-law suggested Wednesday night that he thought the Saudis probably &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; kill Khashoggi, expressing less anger about the situation &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/02/donald-trump-attacks-nordstrom-for-dropping-ivanka\"&gt;than he did when Nordstrom dropped his daughters’s clothing line&lt;/a&gt;. “It would not be a positive,” he &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/FoxNews/status/1050228244061016065\"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; Fox News. “I would not be happy at all.” But while the smallest perceived slights generally result in the president vowing to destroy another country&amp;#8212;&lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/07/donald-trump-breastfeeding-tariffs\"&gt;for instance, threatening to economically cripple Ecuador for promoting breastfeeding&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8212;he apparently sees no reason to stop doing business with the kingdom:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;. . . The president expressed reluctance to punish Saudi Arabia by cutting off arms sales, as some in Washington were proposing. “I think that would be hurting us,” he said. “We have jobs, we have a lot of things happening in this country.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Also on Thursday, Trump made his disregard for Khashoggi’s death even more obvious, &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/atrupar/status/1050425941460172801\"&gt;telling&lt;/a&gt; reporters: “Again, this took place in Turkey, and to the best of our knowledge Khashoggi is not a U.S. citizen, is that right? He’s a permanent resident, O.K. . . . As to whether or not we should stop $110 billion from being spent in this country . . . that would not be acceptable to me.” Incidentally, many say the deal is not worth &lt;a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/markaz/2017/06/05/the-110-billion-arms-deal-to-saudi-arabia-is-fake-news/\"&gt;anywhere near $110 billion&lt;/a&gt;, though accuracy has never been the president’s forte (that would be cozying up to autocrats who flout democratic values and human rights).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you would like to receive the Levin Report in your inbox daily, &lt;a href=\"http://tinyletter.com/besslevin\"&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt; to subscribe.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Business execs worry about optics of appearing chummy with murderous despot&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;On the one hand, there’s a lot of money to be made as Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman pledges to open up Saudi Arabia to foreign investment. On the other, there’s that whole &lt;a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/saudi-journalists-disappearance-sends-chill-through-foreign-investors-firms-1539276550?mod=hp_lead_pos6\"&gt;possible plot to murder a journalist&lt;/a&gt; business:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Since Turkish officials blamed Saudi Arabia for the October 2 disappearance of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, foreign investors have begun re-examining their relationship with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and their participation in his plans to overhaul his country’s economy.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;“The disappearance of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul raises fresh questions about Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s reputation as a reformer and political developments pose a growing threat to the economic outlook,” said &lt;strong&gt;Jason Tuvey,&lt;/strong&gt; an economist at Capital Economics.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It marks a moment for executives to choose whether they want to be associated with Prince Mohammed, said &lt;strong&gt;Karen Young,&lt;/strong&gt; resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, the Washington think tank. “For high-profile C.E.O.s, this is not a good moment for photo ops,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;One opportunity for photo-ops will come later this month, when Saudi Arabia hosts the Future Investment Initiative, an event that has been dubbed “Davos in the Desert.” While &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; has said it will no longer serve as a media sponsor, advisory board member &lt;strong&gt;Arianna Huffington&lt;/strong&gt; no longer plans to attend, and &lt;em&gt;L.A. Times&lt;/em&gt; owner &lt;strong&gt;Patrick Soon-Shiong&lt;/strong&gt; has dropped out as a speaker, Wall Street appears to be in the “weighing the pros and cons” phase. As of Thursday afternoon, C.E.O.s from Blackstone, JPMorgan, Credit Suisse, and Bridgewater were all still &lt;a href=\"http://futureinvestmentinitiative.com/en/2018/speakers\"&gt;listed&lt;/a&gt; as speakers, as was Treasury Secretary &lt;strong&gt;Steven Mnuchin.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trump is still mad at the Fed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, Donald Trump spent a second consecutive day bashing the Federal Reserve for raising interest rates, which he &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/donald-trump-blames-fed-for-market-plunging-800-points\"&gt;blames&lt;/a&gt; for the market &lt;a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/11/us-markets-focus-on-wall-street-rout-as-it-batters-global-markets.html\"&gt;falling more than 1,300 points&lt;/a&gt; in two days. As &lt;em&gt;New York&lt;/em&gt;’s &lt;strong&gt;Josh Barro&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/10/trump-should-blame-self-for-fed-policies-he-calls-crazy.html\"&gt;points out&lt;/a&gt;, if Trump had  idea how any of this works, he would actually blame himself for the Fed raising rates, given that 1) he literally hired a Fed chair, &lt;strong&gt;Jerome Powell,&lt;/strong&gt; who is &lt;a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-trump-fed-chair-20171102-story.html\"&gt;known&lt;/a&gt; for favoring higher interest rates; 2) he used fiscal policy to stoke an already strong economy, which typically pushes inflation up, at which point people like Powell raise rates to fight that inflation; 3) he put Powell in a position of basically &lt;em&gt;having&lt;/em&gt; to raise rates so as not to look like Trump’s puppet because, as the president may or may not be aware, the Fed is supposed to be an independent government agency that doesn‘t cater to the whims of any idiot living at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. (As for the two-day market decline, the blame finger is also pointing squarely in the direction of Big Orange and his trade war with China.)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But Trump doesn’t understand how any of this works, so on Thursday, instead of blaming himself, he &lt;a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-11/trump-escalates-fed-assault-laments-high-rate-he-s-paying\"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;: “The Fed is out of control. I think what they’re doing is wrong,” adding for some unintentional humor that the rates are “not necessary in my opinion and I think I know about it better than they do.” That critique came less than 24 hours after he &lt;a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-fed/trump-calls-loco-federal-reserve-too-aggressive-idUSKCN1ML1TA\"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; reporters, “The Fed is going wild. I mean, I don’t know what their problem is but they are raising interest rates and it’s ridiculous. The problem in my opinion is Treasuries and the Fed. The Fed is going loco and there is no reason for them to do it and I’m not happy about it.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But if you thought the president was simply interfering with monetary policy because he wants to be able to tout the stock market’s gains in the run-up to the midterms, you thought wrong! Naturally, he also has his own bottom line on the brain:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Trump on Thursday also indicated that the Fed’s policies were harming him personally. Trump owes more than $300 million to Deutsche Bank AG of debt with interest rates that rise or fall depending on Fed policy. Higher interest rates could increase his debt payments considerably.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, White House National Economic Council director &lt;strong&gt;Larry Kudlow,&lt;/strong&gt; commenting on the president’s obvious attack on the Fed’s strategy, somehow had this to say: “He has never attacked the Fed’s plan or strategy. He has never interfered with that. He is giving his opinion, and it’s an informed opinion.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;President threatens to expose private citizen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In what has now become a &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/trump-casually-suggests-he-could-blackmail-a-us-senator\"&gt;regularly scheduled feature&lt;/a&gt; of the administration, on Thursday the president of the United States seemingly threatened to reveal the kind of dirt on someone that the &lt;em&gt;National Enquirer&lt;/em&gt; used to &lt;a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/23/national-enquirers-safe-held-damaging-trump-stories.html\"&gt;buy and bury&lt;/a&gt; about him. Per &lt;a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/11/trump-on-gary-cohn-icould-tell-stories-about-him-like-you-wouldnt-believe.html\"&gt;CNBC&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Discussing the various leaks coming out of his administration that have been turned into multiple news stories and a few salacious books, Trump responded sharply when an interviewer on &lt;em&gt;Fox &amp;amp; Friends&lt;/em&gt; suggested that &lt;strong&gt;[Gary] Cohn,&lt;/strong&gt; along with former White House staff secretary &lt;strong&gt;Rob Porter,&lt;/strong&gt; was one of the sources.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;“I was very good to both of them. It could have been [them leaking]. A lot of people have said that,” the president said. “Gary Cohn, I could tell stories about him like you wouldn&amp;#39;t believe.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Cohn who has claimed &lt;em&gt;Fear&lt;/em&gt; “does not accurately portray my experience at the White House,” did not respond to CNBC’s request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Treasury staff should probably lay low for a while&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Or at least gird itself for an all-caps rage tweet filled with inexplicable capitalization and &lt;a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-11/u-s-treasury-staff-said-to-find-china-isn-t-manipulating-yuan?srnd=premium\"&gt;charges of being paid by China and/or the Democrats&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Treasury Department’s staff has advised Secretary Steven Mnuchin that China isn’t manipulating the yuan as the Trump administration prepares to issue a closely watched report on foreign currencies, according to two people familiar with the matter. . . . President Donald Trump has publicly and privately pressured Mnuchin to declare China a currency manipulator, but Treasury staff haven’t found grounds to do so, according to the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Formally accusing China of manipulating the renminbi wouldn’t trigger any sanctions or retribution, but the move would heighten tensions between the world’s two biggest economies.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elsehwhere!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Gundlach Says Trump Is “Crazy Like a Fox” to Blame Fed for Sell-Off (&lt;a

Earlier in the month, the president claimed, with &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/white-house-staff-can-barely-keep-up-with-trump-lies\"&gt;zero evidence&lt;/a&gt;, that “criminals and unknown Middle Easterners are mixed in” with groups of Central Americans seeking refuge in America. Over the weekend, he attempted to heighten the drama by ordering thousands of troops to the border&amp;#8212;a wildly transparent political ploy, considering the caravan is weeks away and those in it plan to surrender and apply for amnesty. Now, with exactly a week until the election, Trump has lobbed a Hail Mary that he clearly hopes will convince voters that Republicans like him are the only thing standing between them and a United States in which every undocumented immigrant gets to kick an American out of their house: a bald-faced lie about how he’s going to issue a (likely unconstitutional!) executive order to end “birthright citizenship.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In a promo for &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt; on HBO, Trump said, “We’re the only country in the world where a person comes in and has a baby, and the baby is essentially a citizen of the United States . . . with all of those benefits,” which is only the first lie of the two-minute clip (More than thirty countries provide birthright citizenship.) Telling host &lt;strong&gt;Jonathan Swan&lt;/strong&gt; that the concept is “ridiculous,” Trump added that while “it was always told to me that you need a constitutional amendment [to get rid of it]” (true), in turns out “you don’t” (false), and claimed the president has the power to end the practice via executive order. &lt;a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-birthright-citizenship-14th-amendment-experts-2018-10\"&gt;Out here in reality, though&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In the U.S., birthright citizenship is enshrined in the 14th Amendment to the Constitution, which says: “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;“Trump has zero authority to amend the Constitution through executive fiat, and he certainly can’t do it with a tweet,” &lt;strong&gt;Matthew Kolken,&lt;/strong&gt; an immigration attorney in Buffalo, New York, told Business Insider on Tuesday. Kolken added that it would be “virtually impossible” to amend the Constitution in today’s political climate. Amendments require either a two-thirds majority vote in both the House of Representatives and the Senate or a constitutional convention called for by two-thirds of State legislatures.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;While some conservatives like to &lt;a href=\"https://www.axios.com/trump-birthright-citizenship-executive-order-0cf4285a-16c6-48f2-a933-bd71fd72ea82.html\"&gt;claim&lt;/a&gt; that the 14th Amendment was only supposed to provide citizenship to babies born in the U.S. to lawful permanent residents&amp;#8212;an argument Vice President &lt;strong&gt;Mike Pence&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/politico/status/1057290978900492290\"&gt;articulated&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday morning&amp;#8212;experts predict that not even a Supreme Court stocked with two judges handpicked by President Law and Order is likely to go for such an argument. “I think the 14th Amendment is clear in enshrining birthright citizenship in the law, and there is interpretive case law from the Supreme Court supporting this,” &lt;strong&gt;Greg Siskind,&lt;/strong&gt; an immigration lawyer, told Business Insider. “Even with a conservative Supreme Court, I have faith the Court will reject this extremist act.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Still, others predict that there could be some wiggle room. Constitutional scholar &lt;strong&gt;John Eastman&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.axios.com/trump-birthright-citizenship-executive-order-0cf4285a-16c6-48f2-a933-bd71fd72ea82.html\"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; Axios that the amendment originally referred to green-card holders and citizens. If Trump follows through on his threat, he said, “the courts would have to weigh in in a way they haven’t.” For Trump, though, actually having the power to end birthright citizenship and convincing the base he does are two very separate things. It doesn’t much matter if he’s lying through his caps, as long as they believe him, which they &lt;a

Khashoggi.","body":"&lt;section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was, to be sure, a discomfiting scene: there was Secretary of State &lt;strong&gt;Mike Pompeo&lt;/strong&gt; amiably clutching the hand of Saudi Crown Prince &lt;strong&gt;Mohammed bin Salman&lt;/strong&gt; in an ornate meeting room in Riyadh a mere fortnight after &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; columnist and Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi had gone missing. The steady drumbeat of revelations had been perplexing and damning and almost inconceivable: the video evidence of Khashoggi entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul; the reports of a 15-person Saudi “kill” team landing in the city, including a so-called bone-saw expert; and &lt;strong&gt;Donald Trump’s&lt;/strong&gt; myriad equivocations. Yet as evidence increasingly suggested a connection between M.B.S. and the presumed murder, Pompeo’s visit seemed like the latest assault to diplomacy. Despite what should have been a somber, mordant affair, he looked like Ed McMahon about to present an oversize check before the camera. (On Friday night, the Saudis conceded what everyone had long known: Khashoggi was dead.)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Back in Washington, members of the diplomatic and intelligence community that I spoke with were gobsmacked. While Axios has &lt;a href=\"https://www.axios.com/saudi-arabia-mike-pompeo-meeting-jamal-khashoggi-1480d505-dcbc-46cb-97e0-34ba5a08655f.html\"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that Pompeo uttered harsh words beneath his avuncular civility, many found the optics insurmountable. “The grip and grin sort of stunned people who saw it,” a congressional aide told me. “There is a lack of confidence that he is doing everything in his power to actually get the truth in this case.” Among diplomatic veterans, Pompeo’s affable demeanor was a real misstep. “Pompeo did not handle this well,” a former high-ranking State Department official sighed. “I don’t think it would have been difficult to be more somber in meetings and more nuanced in comments afterward.” As one State department official lamented to me, “Certainly from where I sit, it is discouraging to see the administration seemingly subordinate our values to other interests in such an egregious case.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Since reports of Khashoggi’s disappearance first began to circulate, Trump has signaled that the death of one journalist&amp;#8212;a citizen of Saudi Arabia, not the United States&amp;#8212;was not worth rupturing the U.S.-Saudi relationship. Last week, the president said it would be a “very tough pill to swallow for our country” if the kingdom was found to be responsible for the assumed killing of Khashoggi, and a $110 billion U.S. arms sales deal with Saudi Arabia was correspondingly imperiled. And despite mounting evidence that M.B.S. was involved, Trump suggested as recently as Monday that “rogue killers” could have been behind the hit. “I have never seen anything quite like that, with the president playing the role of defense lawyer to someone who appears to have murdered a U.S. resident overseas in flagrant violation of every diplomatic norm,” &lt;strong&gt;Daniel Benaim,&lt;/strong&gt; who served as a Middle East adviser to Vice President &lt;strong&gt;Joe Biden,&lt;/strong&gt; told me. “Not to even pretend to have an interest in the rule of law, and to jump straight to the part where you whitewash others’ crimes, is a gross abdication of American values.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;“The president was making excuses for the Saudis. The president, normally, would never do that,” said another former high-ranking State Department official who served in the Middle East. Instead, this source explained, a typical president would stress the seriousness of the situation, praise Khashoggi and the free press, call for an investigation&amp;#8212;possibly by the United Nations&amp;#8212;and rally U.S. allies to consolidate intelligence. By no means would he or she have expressed concerns that the arms agreement could become collateral. “There would be no indication one way or the other of what we were going to be doing,” they said.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not hyperbole to suggest that the Trump administration’s handling of the M.B.S. matter could well define the second half of the president’s term. The U.S.-Saudi relationship impacts everything, on a meta level, from oil prices to the Middle East peace puzzle. More specifically, Saudi Arabia has used its vast sovereign wealth fund, the Public Investment Fund, to intertwine itself with the American financial community&amp;#8212;Saudi money flows through Uber, JPMorgan Chase, Blackstone, Snap, and, &lt;a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2018/10/16/shiny-hollywood-partnership-with-saudi-arabia-suddenly-thrown-its-head/?utm_term=.92779c3aadda\"&gt;until recently&lt;/a&gt;, William Morris Endeavor. It’s also a bulwark against a nuclear Iran, a sort of inelegant centerpiece of Israel’s defense.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;More so than during the early crises of his presidency, Trump appears to comprehend the complexity of it all, which may be what has rendered his administration’s response so limp. Earlier this month, Trump harangued on Twitter that M.B.S. was innocent until proven guilty, a similar refrain he had used to protect &lt;strong&gt;Brett Kavanaugh’s&lt;/strong&gt; nomination. In the end, he seems to be hoping that the whole thing will blow over.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This defensiveness largely falls flat among his fellow lawmakers. “Across the Hill, there is just absolute disgust at what seems to have taken place, and bewilderment over the way the administration has reacted. And I think that runs the gamut from people whose baseline position would be deeply skeptical of the U.S.-Saudi relationship to people who have been traditionally strong supporters of the U.S.-Saudi relationship,” the congressional staffer told me. “By and large, the reaction on the Hill is outrage, and an insistence that we get ourselves a full, clear accounting and a deep skepticism that the Saudis are investigating this on their own&amp;#8212;despite Secretary Pompeo’s assurances&amp;#8212;are really going to provide clarity.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Benaim distilled the dissonance. “Other administrations would certainly have struggled with how to balance America’s values and interests, given the way a case like this impacts both,” he told me. “But Donald Trump doesn’t seem to have that struggle.” Instead, Trump says the quiet part out loud. “In a funny way, what you see is Donald Trump basically adopting the left-wing critique of the U.S.-Saudi relationship&amp;#8212;which reduces a very complex situation with a lot of different variables&amp;#8212;to basically, ‘They can get away with murder, because they are going to buy our weapons.’ He is actually taking the leftist critique of the relationship&amp;#8212;and embracing it.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the Khashoggi drama has unfolded, the close relationship between M.B.S. and &lt;strong&gt;Jared Kushner,&lt;/strong&gt; Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, has come under renewed scrutiny. (&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/18/world/middleeast/jamal-khashoggi-killing-saudi-arabia.html\"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; this week that Kushner was advocating on M.B.S.’s behalf within the White House.) Their relationship dates back to the early days of Trump’s presidency, when &lt;strong&gt;Rex Tillerson&lt;/strong&gt; was still running the State Department. As &lt;strong&gt;Dexter Filkins&lt;/strong&gt; has &lt;a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/in-the-wake-of-khashoggis-disappearance-saudi-arabias-crown-prince-is-pushed-to-the-brink\"&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker,&lt;/em&gt; Kushner identified M.B.S. as a “change agent” in the region, and developed a relationship that effectively sidelined Tillerson. According to one former administration official, Kushner’s communications with M.B.S. over the encrypted messaging service WhatsApp were a point of contention within the administration, one that was partly assuaged when Kushner began providing screenshots of his conversations with the National Security Council. But, this person added, “It was still an after-the-fact thing.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In recent days, a number of sources I have spoken with have raised the possibility that M.B.S.’s ties to Kushner may have instilled in the crown prince a belief that America would, indeed, turn a blind eye to the murder of Khashoggi. “I think there is a lot to be said [about how] M.B.S. thought he could get away with it because Jared Kushner was in his pocket, and so was the president for that matter,” the former State Department official who worked in the Middle East said. And after all, the Trump administration has largely ignored the war in Yemen; the strange sojourn of Lebanese Prime Minister &lt;strong&gt;Saad Hariri&lt;/strong&gt; to Saudi Arabia; the ill-fated boycott of Qatar; and M.B.S.’s spats with Canada and Germany. “The Trump administration made it clear that he had a blank check, and so what do you do when you have a blank check? You write in the craziest sum imaginable and take it to the bank, and that is what he did,” Benaim told me. “Only it seems that the blank check has bounced&amp;#8212;at least with Congress, if not with the president.” (The White House did not respond to a request from comment.)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Whether Trump will yield to the pressure from Capitol Hill and the international community, or side with his son-in-law and his buddy, remains an open question. But if evidence indeed shows that M.B.S. was behind the death of Khashoggi, the crown prince will join the ranks of Syrian President &lt;strong&gt;Bashar al-Assad,&lt;/strong&gt; Russian President &lt;strong&gt;Vladimir Putin,&lt;/strong&gt; and North Korean dictator &lt;strong&gt;Kim Jong Un,&lt;/strong&gt; all of whom have engaged in extraterritorial murders to send a clear message to dissidents. Meanwhile, any remaining hope that M.B.S. is the idealist he’s claimed to be has rapidly dissipated. “I think there was legitimate hope when M.B.S. came on the scene that he was going to be a reformer, and he was going to change course,” the congressional aide told me. “And despite initial appearances and words to that effect, it is pretty clear that is not the case.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;","rubric":"Foreign Policy","socialTitle":"“Absolute Disgust”: Diplomats Fume Over Pompeo’s Saudi “Grip and Grin”","socialDescription":"Throughout Washington, people

few things you can always count on. First, that death comes for everyone. Second, that the current president of the United States will &lt;a href=\"https://www.thecut.com/2018/10/trump-stormy-daniels-horseface-tweet.html\"&gt;call&lt;/a&gt; an adult-film star he paid to keep quiet about an alleged affair “horseface” on social media. And third, that after passing a $1.5 trillion tax cut they insisted would pay for itself &lt;em&gt;and then some,&lt;/em&gt; Republicans would blame social services like Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security for exploding deficits and debt and insist that such “entitlements,” sadly, have got to go.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As a reminder, the Grand Old Party put on a big show of pretending to care about “fiscal responsibility” when &lt;strong&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/strong&gt; was in office and mouth-watering tax cuts weren’t on the line. “Only one thing can save this country, and that’s to get a handle on this deficit-and-debt issue,” Majority Leader &lt;strong&gt;Mitch McConnell&lt;/strong&gt; insisted after the 44th president won his second term. “The federal fiscal burden threatens the security, liberty, and independence of our nation,” the Republican Party platform &lt;a href=\"https://prod-cdn-static.gop.com/media/documents/DRAFT_12_FINAL%5B1%5D-ben_1468872234.pdf\"&gt;warned&lt;/a&gt; in 2016. “You’re bankrupting our grandchildren!” was a common refrain, as were proclamations &lt;a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/video/full-corker-won-t-support-gop-tax-plan-if-it-adds-to-deficit-1059037763567\"&gt;such as&lt;/a&gt;, “I won’t endorse a bill that adds one penny to the deficit!” Then &lt;strong&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/strong&gt; won the election, and all those worries about crippling the next generation and the country going to hell in a handbasket vanished overnight&amp;#8212;almost as though it was feigned in the first place!&amp;#8212;with Republicans not only demanding that Congress pass a deficit-busting piece of legislation so that the president and his children &lt;a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/20/trump-tax-bill-savings-analysis\"&gt;could pay even fewer taxes&lt;/a&gt; than they &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/donald-trump-fred-trump-taxes\"&gt;already&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/13/business/jared-kushner-taxes.html\"&gt;do&lt;/a&gt;, but maintaining&amp;#8212;laws of math, physics, time and space be damned&amp;#8212;that the bill &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/11/trump-tax-plan-name\"&gt;once known as the “Cut Cut Cut Act”&lt;/a&gt; would actually help &lt;a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/16/trumps-tax-cut-didnt-reduce-the-deficit--despite-his-many-promises.html\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;shrink&lt;/em&gt; the deficit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But as the G.O.P. surely knew, that was never going to happen. Instead, as we &lt;a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/15/us-budget-deficit-expands-to-779-billion-in-fiscal-2018-as-spending-surges.html\"&gt;learned&lt;/a&gt; this week, the U.S. budget deficit increased to $779 billion for the fiscal year, a 17 percent increase from the year prior, which is extra bad considering the economy is doing well, a scenario in which &lt;a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2018/10/16/blame-republican-tax-cuts-soaring-federal-deficits-column/1657338002/\"&gt;the federal deficit typically falls&lt;/a&gt;. Luckily, Mitch McConnell knows exactly &lt;a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-16/mcconnell-blames-entitlements-not-gop-for-rising-deficits\"&gt;who and what to blame&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;“It’s disappointing, but it’s not a Republican problem,” McConnell said Tuesday in an interview with Bloomberg News when asked about the rising deficits and debt. “It’s a bipartisan problem: unwillingness to address the real drivers of the debt by doing anything to adjust those programs to the demographics of America in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The “real” drivers of debt, according to McConnell, are “Medicare, Social Security, and Medicaid,” “entitlements” from which the Senate majority leader would cut off the old and poor if only he could get Democrats to sign on. (That’s probably unlikely to happen, given &lt;strong&gt;Nancy Pelosi’s&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/mcconnell-calls-deficit-very-disturbing-blames-federal-spending-dismisses-criticism-of-tax-cut/2018/10/16/a5b93da0-d15c-11e8-8c22-fa2ef74bd6d6_story.html?utm_term=.a01fd08c01cd\"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; today that, “Like clockwork, Republicans in Congress are setting in motion their plan to destroy the Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security that seniors and families rely on, just months after they exploded the deficit by $2 trillion with their tax scam for the rich,” and &lt;strong&gt;Chuck Schumer’s&lt;/strong&gt; that suggesting cuts to “middle-class programs like Medicare, Social Security, and Medicaid as the only fiscally responsible solution to solve the debt problem is nothing short of gaslighting.”)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;McConnell’s take on the situation echoes that of the White House, whose National Economic Council director, &lt;strong&gt;Larry Kudlow,&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/09/gary-cohn-blames-waitresses-in-las-vegas-for-financial-crisis\"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; last month that he doesn’t “buy” the argument that tax cuts increase the deficit, and that the &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; problem is “principally spending too much.” (Kudlow, who has a penchant for &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/03/tv-pundit-who-blew-the-financial-crisis-could-be-trumps-next-gary-cohn\"&gt;never being right about anything&lt;/a&gt;, also &lt;a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/29/larry-kudlow-says-deficit-coming-down-rapidly-against-cbo-evidence.html\"&gt;claimed&lt;/a&gt; in June that the deficit was “coming down rapidly.”) Treasury Secretary &lt;strong&gt;Steven Mnuchin&lt;/strong&gt; was even more blunt while telling his &lt;a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/11/politics/mnuchin-budget-deficit/index.html\"&gt;assessment&lt;/a&gt; to CNN last week, “People are going to want to say the deficit is because of the tax cuts. That’s not the real story.” (The report out of his own department &lt;a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2018/10/16/blame-republican-tax-cuts-soaring-federal-deficits-column/1657338002/\"&gt;suggests otherwise&lt;/a&gt;.) Incidentally, in June, reports &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/07/the-trump-administration-wants-to-give-the-rich-another-giant-tax-cut\"&gt;circulated&lt;/a&gt; that the Trump administration was trying to figure out a workaround to cut another $100 billion from the tax bills of the wealthiest Americans, and in late September, House Republicans &lt;a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/house-republicans-pass-bill-to-extend-individual-tax-cuts/2018/09/28/2497d6bc-c326-11e8-97a5-ab1e46bb3bc7_story.html\"&gt;passed&lt;/a&gt; a piece of legislation that would add more than $600 billion to the debt over the next decade. Neither measure will come to fruition, but on the off-chance that one does, we’re sure McConnell stands ready to blame the poor and elderly freeloaders who clearly hate America.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you would like to receive the Levin Report in your inbox daily, &lt;a href=\"http://tinyletter.com/besslevin\"&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt; to subscribe.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trump: Saudi Arabia being falsely accused of murder just like Brett Kavanaugh was falsely accused of sexual assault&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;“I think we have to find out what happened first,” the president &lt;a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-16/trump-says-saudi-prince-denies-knowledge-of-khashoggi-incident\"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; the Associated Press on Tuesday while commenting on the compelling body of evidence that points to Saudi Arabia’s involvement in the disappearance of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. “Here we go again with, you know, you’re guilty until proven innocent. I don’t like that. We just went through that with Justice Kavanaugh and he was innocent all the way as far as I’m concerned.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;President of the United States now claiming Federal Reserve is the biggest threat to his presidency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, you heard that correctly: Not the special prosecutor’s Russia investigation, or the trade war with China that’s hurting U.S. companies in states that voted for him, or impeachment, but the Federal Reserve, &lt;a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/16/trump-says-fed-is-his-biggest-threat-because-it-is-raising-rates-too-fast.html\"&gt;which is run by his hand-picked Fed chair&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Trump on Tuesday escalated his assault on the Federal Reserve, calling it “my biggest threat.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;“Because the Fed is raising rates too fast. And it’s independent, so I don&amp;#39;t speak to him,” Trump said in an interview with Fox Business, referring to Fed Chairman &lt;strong&gt;Jerome Powell.&lt;/strong&gt; “But I’m not happy with what he’s doing because it’s going too fast. Because&amp;#8212;you look at the last inflation numbers, they’re very low.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Trump has been attacking Powell for several months now over the central banker’s decision to raise rates, which President Buy and Sell blamed last week for the two-day market decline. “The problem [causing the market drop] in my opinion is Treasury and the Fed,” he &lt;a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/11/trump-doubles-down-on-fed-attacks-saying-its-going-loco.html\"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; at the time. “The Fed is going loco and there’s no reason for them to do it. I’m not happy about it.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Beautiful, clean coal” industry won’t be getting its bailout just yet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And after all &lt;strong&gt;Rick Perry’s&lt;/strong&gt; hard work! &lt;a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2018/10/15/rick-perry-coal-rescue-trump-850528\"&gt;Per Politico&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The White House directed Perry to “prepare immediate steps to stop the loss” of retiring coal and nuclear plants more than four months ago, and Trump even interrupted an Ohio fund-raiser in May to order an aide to call Perry to talk about the bailout. He also touted the national security benefits of coal a few months later at another West Virginia speech. . . . But the White House has shelved the plan amid opposition from the president’s own advisers on the National Security Council and National Economic Council, according to four people with knowledge of the discussions.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;“The problem they’ve got is every option they might consider raises the costs for somebody at a time when nobody has an appetite for increased costs anywhere,” &lt;strong&gt;Bob Coward,&lt;/strong&gt; co-leader of energy advisory firm MPR Associates, told Politico. “I think that’s the problem they keep running into. The political will to pay for it is not broadly there enough yet for them.” Still, the industry can’t be &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; mad at the president, who ditched the Paris climate accord last year and has pushing to just &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/08/trump-epa-just-going-to-let-beautiful-clean-coal-plants-regulate-themselves\"&gt;let coal plants to regulate themselves&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elsewhere!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Uber Proposals Value Company at $120 Billion in a Possible I.P.O.

Daniels&lt;/strong&gt; a small, petty win, just one day after her &lt;a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/15/admin/stormy-daniels-lawsuit-dismissed-trump.html\"&gt;defamation lawsuit against &lt;strong&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was dismissed by a federal judge in California&amp;#8212;and just a few hours after the president gloated about the case on Twitter, belligerently calling the adult-film star &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2018/10/maybe-donald-trump-isnt-an-insult-genius-after-all\"&gt;“horseface.”&lt;/a&gt; According to the A.P., the president’s &lt;em&gt;60 Minutes&lt;/em&gt; interview on Sunday night &lt;a href=\"http://twitter.com/ZekeJMiller/status/1052265511898279937\"&gt;reached&lt;/a&gt; 11.7 million viewers, just over half as many as Daniels pulled for her own blockbuster &lt;em&gt;60 Minutes&lt;/em&gt; interview back in March. Around 22 million viewers tuned in then to watch Daniels discuss her alleged 2006 affair with the president. That interview got the program’s highest ratings since a 2008 interview with &lt;strong&gt;Barack&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Michelle Obama.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Trump’s episode also flopped in comparison to his &lt;em&gt;60 Minutes&lt;/em&gt; interview in 2016, &lt;a href=\"https://deadline.com/2016/11/donald-trump-60-minutes-interview-ratings-rise-seahawks-patriots-sunday-night-football-rises-nbc-nfl-cbs-1201853888/\"&gt;which drew&lt;/a&gt; 20 million viewers. In the latest interview, conducted by &lt;strong&gt;Lesley Stahl,&lt;/strong&gt; Trump &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/donald-trump-60-minutes-interview\"&gt;was asked about&lt;/a&gt; an array of topics, from the tariffs he’s slapped on China to his relationship with North Korean dictator &lt;strong&gt;Kim Jong Un.&lt;/strong&gt; “I’m not a baby,” he said when Stahl rattled off a quick list of accusations surrounding Kim, pressing Trump to explain his adoration for the dictator. “I know these things.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The president also spoke about Dr. &lt;strong&gt;Christine Blasey Ford&lt;/strong&gt; and his Mississippi speech, the one in which he mimicked the professor and essentially accused her of lying about her sexual assault allegation against &lt;strong&gt;Brett Kavanaugh&lt;/strong&gt; (who denied the accusation). “I’m not gonna get into it because we won,” Trump said when asked if, in hindsight, he thought had been disrespectful toward Ford. “It doesn’t matter. We won.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;While his bombastic quotes hurtled around the Internet, one particular image from the interview also got attention: a painting that now hangs in the White House and shows Trump sitting at a table and having drinks with Republican presidents of the past, including Abraham Lincoln, Teddy Roosevelt, and Ronald Reagan. Titled “The Republican Club,” the piece is &lt;a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-hangs-tacky-fantasy-painting-of-himself-with-gop-presidents-in-white-house\"&gt;by artist &lt;strong&gt;Andy Thomas&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and was a gift to the president from Rep. &lt;strong&gt;Darrell Issa.&lt;/strong&gt; Viewers also got a glimpse at a jar full of &lt;a href=\"https://www.eater.com/2018/10/15/17977946/donald-trump-starburst-red-pink-60-minutes-interview\"&gt;red and pink Starburst candies&lt;/a&gt; within arm’s reach of Trump’s desk.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Sunday night, it turns out, was a bit of a ratings pit for Trumps across the board, including the president’s principle &lt;em&gt;Saturday Night Live&lt;/em&gt; mimicker, &lt;strong&gt;Alec Baldwin.&lt;/strong&gt; The actor’s new talk show, &lt;em&gt;The Alec Baldwin Show,&lt;/em&gt; debuted to a frail 2.2 million viewers. Per &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://ew.com/tv/2018/10/15/alec-baldwin-talk-show-ratings/\"&gt;Entertainment Weekly&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; it was the lowest-rated show of the night for that demo on a broadcast network. In the episode, Baldwin chatted with &lt;strong&gt;Taraji P.

president also took another shot at the reporters covering his rally.","body":"&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/strong&gt; has once again positioned himself against the #MeToo movement, mocking it during his Wednesday night rally in Pennsylvania. While reminiscing on his victory in the state in the 2016 presidential election&amp;#8212;like an old high-school quarterback revisiting the field over and over&amp;#8212;Trump stopped himself from using a certain expression, blaming “the rules of MeToo.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;“Pennsylvania hasn’t been won for many years by Republicans, but every Republican thinks they’re going to win Pennsylvania,” he said, &lt;a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/10/politics/trump-rally-mocks-me-too/index.html\"&gt;according to CNN&lt;/a&gt;. “I used an expression&amp;#8212;you know, there’s an expression, but under the rules of MeToo I’m not allowed to use that expression anymore. I can’t do it.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;He said the expression is akin to “the person that got away. See, in the old days, it was a little different.” When an audience member encouraged him to “do it anyway,” Trump laughed and pointed to the news cameras. “I would do it, except for these people up there. They would say, did you hear what President Trump said?”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;He continued, saying, “So there is an expression, but we’ll change the expression: Pennsylvania was always the person who got away. That’s pretty good, right? The person that got away?”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It’s unclear what Trump thinks the “rules” of #MeToo are. The movement, started by activist &lt;strong&gt;Tarana Burke,&lt;/strong&gt; began as a way for survivors of sexual misconduct to voice their pain and show solidarity with fellow survivors. It has sprawled into something greater, tied to the broader societal reckoning over sexual misconduct that &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/10/a-year-without-harvey-weinstein-oscar-monster\"&gt;began a year ago&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8212;but the message at its core has remained the same.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Trump, who has been accused of sexual misconduct himself multiple times (he has denied the claims), has made his stance clear on the growing movement. He first insulted it in July: while referring to Senator &lt;strong&gt;Elizabeth Warren&lt;/strong&gt; of Massachusetts, whom he has taken to calling “Pocahontas” because of her Native American heritage, Trump said he would like to send an ancestry kit her way. “We’ll take that little kit and say&amp;#8212;we have to do it gently because we are in the MeToo generation&amp;#8212;and we will very gently take that kit, slowly toss it [to her],” he said.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Last week, Trump also &lt;a href=\"http://time.com/5412955/donald-trump-says-scary-time-men-sexual-assault-allegations/\"&gt;told reporters&lt;/a&gt; that “it is a very scary time for young men in America, where you can be guilty of something you may not be guilty of”&amp;#8212;referring to the scandal surrounding &lt;strong&gt;Brett Kavanaugh&lt;/strong&gt; (who has since been sworn into the Supreme Court, despite sexual assault allegations he denied). “This is a very, very&amp;#8212;this is a very difficult time. What’s happening here has much more to do than even the appointment of a Supreme Court justice.”&lt;/p&gt;","rubric":"#MeToo","socialTitle":"Trump Mocks #MeToo Movement Days After Decrying “a Scary

suburban women.","body":"&lt;p&gt;The emergence of &lt;strong&gt;Dina Powell&lt;/strong&gt; as the presumed front-runner to replace &lt;strong&gt;Nikki Haley&lt;/strong&gt; at the United Nations was received with unusual bipartisan acceptance, at least as far as Trump political nominees are concerned. “If it is Dina Powell, I would guess she gets support from several Democrats,” a Democratic Senate aide told me Wednesday. “It sure looks like it will be Dina Powell and everyone will be like, ‘O.K., that sounds right,’ and that will be it.” After serving as National Security Adviser &lt;strong&gt;H.R. McMaster’s&lt;/strong&gt; deputy and holding multiple positions in the &lt;strong&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/strong&gt; State Department, Powell would be well qualified&amp;#8212;more so than Haley was when she became the U.S. ambassador to the U.N. But by Thursday afternoon, Powell had reportedly informed her bosses at Goldman Sachs, where she serves as an executive on the bank’s management committee, that she wasn’t interested in the job.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;With Powell out of contention, there is no clear favorite to succeed Haley in Turtle Bay. Further complicating matters, Politico &lt;a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2018/10/11/trump-gender-gap-un-895498\"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;, White House aides are pushing &lt;strong&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/strong&gt; to tap a woman for the job in order to shore up support within a critical demographic ahead of the November midterms. It is not an idle concern: publicly, Republican leaders have argued that the bruising Supreme Court confirmation battle over &lt;strong&gt;Brett Kavanaugh,&lt;/strong&gt; who faced multiple allegations of sexual misconduct, helped energize the G.O.P. base. (Kavanaugh denied all the allegations against him.) And initially, polls did indeed reflect a slight uptick in enthusiasm among Republican voters. But in the days since, the numbers have told a different story. The percentage of women who view Kavanaugh negatively jumped 20 points to 53 percent between August and October, &lt;a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/08/politics/cnn-poll-kavanaugh-confirmation/index.html\"&gt;according&lt;/a&gt; to a CNN poll released Thursday. Trump himself has an abysmal disapproval rating of 63 percent among women voters.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Trumpworld seems aware of the political ramifications, and views the U.N. posting as a potential remedy. “The political shop thinks it’s very important to announce a woman before Election Day because of the president’s approval rating and the Kavanaugh stuff,” one source in regular contact with the president told Politico.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The appointment, after all, is as much about optics as it is about policy. As the Democratic Senate aide observed when Haley announced her resignation, Trump keeps most of his political appointees on a tight leash. “I don’t think it is that big of a deal, to be honest with you. . . . Is the new U.N. ambassador going to come in and fundamentally change the Trump administration’s foreign policy? I don’t think anyone thinks that,” this person told me. “Nikki Haley was more interesting politically than policy-wise.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Of course, the notion that appointing a woman to serve as the U.S. ambassador to the U.N. would offset Trump’s unpopularity among suburban women voters may be wishful thinking, given the ground he must make up. “Democrats’ chances of taking the majority are squarely within those moderate suburban districts,” explained &lt;strong&gt;Steve Israel,&lt;/strong&gt; a former New York congressman and chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. “Look at the energy. The day after Trump’s inaugural, moderate women who did not vote in 2016 took to the streets. That’s the first bookend. The final bookend will be in the midterm elections, when you take to the polls.” Anywhere you look, he said, “you see nuclear energy among Democrats, and the Kavanaugh nomination brought it to even higher levels.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Republican strategist &lt;strong&gt;Terry Sullivan,&lt;/strong&gt; who ran Senator &lt;strong&gt;Marco Rubio’s&lt;/strong&gt; 2016 presidential campaign, concurred that Haley’s replacement will be largely inconsequential in November. “It will have almost zero impact on the midterms,” he told me. But he added that from a longer-term perspective, appointing a woman to the job could help Trump. “He needs more female validators in there for his re-election in 2020,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;With Powell out of the running, the list of women under consideration to replace Haley reportedly includes &lt;strong&gt;Nancy Brinker,&lt;/strong&gt; the founder of the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation; former New Hampshire senator &lt;strong&gt;Kelly Ayotte;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Kelly Knight Craft,&lt;/strong&gt; the U.S. ambassador to Canada; and &lt;strong&gt;Kay Bailey Hutchison,&lt;/strong&gt; the current U.S. ambassador to NATO. Of these women, Ayotte is perhaps the most intriguing possibility. As Sullivan explained, Ayotte is viewed within Republican circles as “smart, competent, and a great face for the G.O.P.” As a suburban working mom, she fits the exact demographic the Republican Party is struggling to hold on to in the Trump era. Her previously fraught relationship with Trump could be a sticking point. But then again, she did shepherd Supreme Court Justice &lt;strong&gt;Neil Gorsuch&lt;/strong&gt; through his Senate confirmation process. Haley herself backed Rubio in the 2016 primary race and once gave candidate Trump the South Carolina equivalent of the middle finger: “Bless your heart.”&lt;/p&gt;","rubric":"Trump

entrepreneurs are lucky to have one billion-dollar company to their name. Elon Musk, America’s real-life Tony Stark, has four. Perhaps best known as the C.E.O. and founder of the private aerospace company SpaceX and C.E.O. and co-founder of electric carmaker Tesla Motors, Musk isn’t shy about his ultimate ambitions: helping to save the planet by shifting the world economy to sustainable energy. But, like any savvy billionaire, Musk is hedging his bets, too, by working actively to establish a human colony on Mars.\n&lt;p&gt;If anyone can bring humanity into the interplanetary age, it’s Musk. Born in South Africa to an electrical engineer father and model Maye Musk, he developed an interest in computer programming at an early age, selling the code to a video game he had developed to a magazine when he was just 12 years old. In 1992, Musk moved to the United States, where he received a dual degree from the University of Pennsylvania in physics and economics, before flying west to Stanford to begin a Ph.D. in applied physics. Two days into his program, he dropped out to become an entrepreneur. His first start-up, a software company called Zip2, sold to Compaq four years later, in 1999, for more than $300 million in cash, with more than $30 million in stock options.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A millionaire many times over at the age of 28, Musk didn’t hesitate before starting over again with X.com, a financial services business that quickly merged with the company that would become PayPal. Two years later, the payments processing start-up was acquired by eBay for $1.5 billion in stock, netting Musk another $165 million. But by then, Musk was already dreaming bigger. In 2002, he poured $100 million of his fortune into founding SpaceX, a private aerospace company with the goal of making spaceflight affordable by building the first reusable rocket. And in 2004, he got involved with Tesla Motors, leading a series A funding round and joining its board as chairman. That limitless ambition nearly cost him everything. During the financial crisis in 2008, after he had become C.E.O. of Tesla, both companies were on the verge of failure and Musk was deep in personal debt trying to keep them afloat. But Musk is the “most risk-immune person I’ve ever met,” recalled venture capitalist Steve Jurvetson, a friend and managing partner at Draper Fisher Jurvetson, the renowned venture capital firm, who has backed both efforts, in an interview with Esther Dyson for &lt;em&gt;Business Insider.&lt;/em&gt; “He’s really an American hero, more than anyone I’ve ever met.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;SpaceX and Tesla both pulled through, thanks to Musk and an assist from the U.S. government, which gave him a $1.6 billion NASA contract and offered generous green energy subsidies on Tesla’s first production car, the blistering fast, all-electric Roadster. Today, SpaceX is the largest private producer of rocket motors in the world, and Tesla is onto its third-generation vehicle, the Model 3, which has already secured about $15 billion in pre-order sales, according to the company. SolarCity, another company Musk co-founded and for which he is the largest shareholder, is now one of the top two residential solar contractors in the U.S. Musk, obviously, is not taking a break from success. His next mission? Landing a rocket ship on Mars, as early as 2018.&lt;/p&gt;","socialMedia":[],"photos":{"tout":[{"aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":1400,"height":700,"format":"JPEG","url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2016/06/01/574f453f97af2de420958dc6_hive-contributor-profile-elon-musk.jpg"}},"revisionCreatedAt":"June 1, 2016 4:27 pm","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","image":true},"revisionAuthor":"Kelly Butler","filename":"hive-contributor-profile-elon-musk.jpg","_embedded":{"categories-channels":[],"variantXsmall":[],"variantSmall":[],"variantMedium":[],"variantLarge":[],"variantXlarge":[],"_categories":{}},"title":"hive-contributor-profile-elon-musk.jpg","credit":"By Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images.","_links":{},"id":"574f453fbdf148e4205f29df","createdAt":"June 1, 2016 4:27 pm","revision":2,"modifiedAt":"June 1, 2016 4:27 pm","contributors":{}}]},"pubDate":"May 25, 2017 11:21 am","url":"/people/elon-musk","mainPhotoContributors":{},"_embedded":{"photosTout":[{"fields":{"aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":1400,"height":700,"format":"JPEG","url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2016/06/01/574f453f97af2de420958dc6_hive-contributor-profile-elon-musk.jpg"}},"revisionCreatedAt":"June 1, 2016 4:27 pm","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","image":true},"revisionAuthor":"Kelly Butler","filename":"hive-contributor-profile-elon-musk.jpg","_embedded":{"categories-channels":[],"variantXsmall":[],"variantSmall":[],"variantMedium":[],"variantLarge":[],"variantXlarge":[],"_categories":{}},"title":"hive-contributor-profile-elon-musk.jpg","credit":"By Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images.","_links":{},"id":"574f453fbdf148e4205f29df","createdAt":"June 1, 2016 4:27 pm","revision":2,"modifiedAt":"June 1, 2016 4:27 pm","contributors":{}}}],"contributorsAuthor":[],"contributorsPhotographer":[],"_categories":{},"publishHistory":{"entityId":"574f454cbdf148e4205f29e0","revision":0,"pubDate":"May 25, 2017 11:21 am","revisionAuthor":"Charles Truelson","searchable":true,"expired":false,"createdAt":"May 25, 2017 11:21 am","uri":"people/elon-musk"},"related":[{}]},"relatedItems":{"items":[{"hed":"Thanks to Elon Musk and Grimes, the Summer of Strange Love Isn’t Entirely Over","promoHed":"Thanks to Elon Musk and Grimes, the Summer of Strange Love Isn’t Entirely Over","dek":"Pete Davidson and Ariana Grande have split up, but Musk and Grimes went to a pumpkin patch.","promoDek":"Pete Davidson and Ariana Grande have split up, but Musk and Grimes went to a pumpkin patch.","body":"&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elon Musk,&lt;/strong&gt; the man in the mission to Mars, and &lt;strong&gt;Grimes,&lt;/strong&gt; a goth-alien-witch-princess sent to destroy (?)

It’s October, and they’re both ghouls. Musk has five children to entertain. Los Angeles before Halloween is one large pumpkin patch connected by red carpets where celebrities and paparazzi coexist. The odds that they would be getting photographed in a pumpkin patch together are high.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Except, as popular knowledge would suggest, these two had broken up. They were together all summer, roughly since &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2018/05/elon-musk-grimes-met-gala\"&gt;the Met Gala in May&lt;/a&gt;, when they were each others dates, and managed to remain un-engaged through August, despite the rest of the strange-love couples doing so. (Mazel, &lt;strong&gt;Priyanka Chopra&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Nick Jonas&lt;/strong&gt;; R.I.P., &lt;strong&gt;Ariana Grande&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Pete Davidson&lt;/strong&gt;; ???, &lt;strong&gt;Justin Bieber&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Hailey Baldwin.&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But then fellow goth-alien-witch-princess &lt;strong&gt;Azealia Banks&lt;/strong&gt; entered Musk’s house and finished the job that their extraterrestrial overlords sent Grimes to do (destroying Musk). Banks said she was stuck in the house, and then posted screenshots of texts in which Grimes claimed “the Russians” want Musk dead, that she introduced him to weed, and all sorts of other stuff that was fairly hard to follow (read more about that moment in the culture &lt;a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/8/16/17692700/azealia-banks-elon-musk-grimes-explained\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, in what would otherwise seem to be an act of self-immolation, Musk tweeted that he had secured the financing to take Tesla private. The Securities and Exchange Commission &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/09/elon-musks-tweets-just-got-him-sued\"&gt;sued him for making “false and misleading” statements&lt;/a&gt;, he settled, paid a $20 million fine, and resigned as chairman of Tesla’s board (but remained its C.E.O.). Musk broke down in tears during a &lt;a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/16/business/elon-musk-interview-tesla.html\"&gt;no-holds-barred interview&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;em&gt;The New York Times,&lt;/em&gt; and a few days later Musk and Grimes &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2018/08/elon-musk-and-grimes-may-be-over-according-to-instagram-sleuths\"&gt;unfollowed each other on Instagram&lt;/a&gt;. On August 21, he deleted his account. On August 29, he returned to Twitter. Legally, I have to say, “Who knows if all of these things are related? They’re probably not related.” But in the goth-alien-witch-princess universe, and in the cosmic sense, they were definitely related.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, now Grimes and Musk are together in a pumpkin patch. Happy Halloween.&lt;/p&gt;","rubric":"Grimusk","socialTitle":"Thanks to Elon Musk and Grimes, the Summer of Strange Love Isn’t Entirely Over","socialDescription":"Pete Davidson and Ariana Grande have

the V-word: Valeant.","promoDek":"One influential investor is now using the V-word: Valeant.","body":"&lt;p&gt;You’ve got to hand it to &lt;strong&gt;Elon Musk.&lt;/strong&gt; The multi-billionaire knows how to get media attention, albeit in a &lt;strong&gt;Michael Avenatti&lt;/strong&gt; kind of way. Whether tweeting that he had “secured” funding to take Tesla private at $420 a share, being sued by the Securities and Exchange Commission when he said funding didn’t materialize, &lt;a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/04/elon-musk-mocks-sec-as-shortseller-enrichment-commission-days-after-settlement.html\"&gt;mocking&lt;/a&gt; the agency after it agreed to settle allegations of securities fraud against him (but before a judge has approved the deal), or smoking a spliff on an Internet radio show, the guy is a bona fide hornets’ nest for shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In an age when we are all on input overload, as my colleague &lt;strong&gt;Nick Bilton&lt;/strong&gt; has &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/elon-musk-tesla-sec-henry-ford-kanye-west\"&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt;, Musk’s ability to cut through the piles of gibberish with his own version of it has probably been quite effective at bringing attention to Tesla, his $40 billion cutting-edge electric-car manufacturer; Space X, his rocket-ship company; and to the Boring Company, his business that is building an underground tunnel in California. (Good luck to &lt;strong&gt;James Murdoch,&lt;/strong&gt; a board member who is &lt;a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/adbcdaf0-cca9-11e8-b276-b9069bde0956\"&gt;rumored&lt;/a&gt; to be ascending to chairman, to curb this behavior.)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But is Wall Street getting sick of his shtick? Just as there seems to be widespread agreement in the canyons of finance that, all things considered, it would be better if the 47-year-old Musk stopped acting like an impetuous teenager and more like a corporate C.E.O., there is still widespread disagreement about which direction Tesla is going. Is it headed into bankruptcy, soon to be owned by stiffed creditors, or is it on its way to being the next Amazon-lite? That seems to be the burning question at the moment among Wall Street analysts.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Some, like &lt;strong&gt;Maynard Um,&lt;/strong&gt; at Macquarie Research, started his coverage of Tesla on Tuesday with an “outperform” rating and a price target for the stock of $430 per share, a coy $10 per share higher than the &lt;a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/sec-says-elon-musks-420-price-point-was-a-weed-reference-2018-9\"&gt;marijuana-inspired&lt;/a&gt; price at which Musk said he was going take the company private in August. Um wrote that Tesla is a “disruptive technology growth company” in the “equally disruptive markets of electric cars, energy storage, and energy generation.” He predicted Tesla would reach “profitability” in the second half of 2018, a point that definitely remains to be seen, given that Tesla had an operating loss of $1.7 billion in the first six months of the year. Tesla’s stock price is around $250 these days, so Um, and any investors who take his advice to buy the stock, could be in for a long wait until $430.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Then there is Berenberg Bank, which in the great tradition of &lt;strong&gt;Henry Blodget&lt;/strong&gt; and Amazon from once upon a time, has a $500 price target on Tesla. The market, the small 428-year-old German investment bank observed, “underestimates the full extent of Tesla’s technological advantage . . . which manifests in the entire electronic architecture of the vehicle as well as the battery-management system.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Perhaps, instead, the market is actually focused on Tesla’s production problems, its ongoing operating losses, its looming debt payments&amp;#8212;&lt;a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/jimcollins/2018/04/02/forget-the-autopilot-crash-and-recall-teslas-daunting-debt-repayment-schedule-is-the-real-issue/#735329c4113d\"&gt;$1.8 billion of Tesla’s some $11 billion in debt is coming due in the next 13 months&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8212;and its dwindling cash balances. &lt;strong&gt;Fahmi Quadir,&lt;/strong&gt; the founder of the tiny Safkhet Capital, is famous for making an early call that Valeant Pharmaceuticals would have its day of reckoning. Hedge-fund manager &lt;strong&gt;Bill Ackman&lt;/strong&gt; equally famously lost more than $4 billion betting the opposite would be true. In July, Quadir started betting that Tesla’s stock price would fall.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Quadir told Bloomberg yesterday that Tesla was “between a rock and a hard place” because it needs more capital&amp;#8212;some say as much as $2 billion more before long&amp;#8212;and it will likely be forced to raise new capital in either the equity markets, likely at a discounted price, or in the debt markets, which is already choking on Tesla debt. If Musk goes the debt route, he will likely have to pay up for it. The company’s $1.8 billion senior notes, issued at an interest rate of 5.3 percent last year, now yield 8.65 percent, meaning Musk will likely have pay investors at least 8.65 percent, and probably more, to convince them to buy a new issue of Tesla debt. “It’s becoming more and more apparent that Tesla is having difficulties paying their bills,” Quadir said. “I saw a lot of the same with Valeant.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Another indicator of trouble is the increasing cost to investors who want to insure the risk that Tesla will default on its debt. The premium required&amp;#8212;up front&amp;#8212;to insure $10 million of Tesla’s bonds in case they default sometime in the next five years is now $2 million. Two months ago that cost was below $1.3 million. In other words, the market is telling investors that the risk of a debt default at Tesla is increasing, and if you want to do something about it, whether you own the Tesla bonds or not, it’ll cost you $700,000 more today to make that bet than it would have cost two months ago. Part of what the debt market worries about with Tesla are three looming convertible-debt payments that are coming due in the next 13 months. If the Tesla stock were trading higher than the current price, the debt holders would convert the debt into equity and the problem would disappear. But, for instance, the $920 million convertible-debt maturity due in March will have to be repaid using some of Tesla’s around $2 billion in cash&amp;#8212;about half of what it had a year ago&amp;#8212;unless the Tesla stock is trading at $360 per share, and that seems increasingly unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If Musk is concerned in the least about any of this, he’s not letting on. Last week, in an e-mail to employees, he said Tesla was “very close to achieving profitability and proving the naysayers wrong.” He’s been tweeting lately about Tesla’s Model 3 having the “lowest probability of injury” of any vehicle ever tested, whatever that means, and he’s been retweeting the news that the Model 3 is the top-selling American-made car in the country. On Sunday, he was also trumpeting the latest successful launch, and landing, of one of his Space X rockets, from an Air Force base in California.&lt;/p&gt;","rubric":"Elon Musk","socialTitle":"“Tesla Is Having Difficulties Paying Their Bills”: Is Wall Street Ready to Punish Elon Musk?","socialDescription":"One influential investor is now using the V-word: Valeant.","seoTitle":"“Tesla Is Having Difficulties Paying Their Bills”: Is Wall Street Ready to Punish Elon Musk for His Shenanigans?","seoDescription":"One influential investor is now using the V-word: Valeant.","channel":"News","subChannel":"Business","issueDate":"","ledeCaption":"Elon Musk at SXSW in March.","contentSource":"web","canonicalUrl":"","contentType":"","textMimeType":"","tags":["elon musk","tesla"],"revisionAuthor":"Brad Beatson","meta":{"collectionName":"articles","modelName":"article","publishable":true,"identifiable":true,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":true,"hierarchical":false},"interactiveOverride":"","id":"5bbe73b660b2c02d5cf2834e","revision":20,"createdAt":"October 10, 2018 5:48 pm","modifiedAt":"October 10, 2018 9:11 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"October 10, 2018 9:11 pm","_embedded":{"categories-channels":[{"fields":{"name":"News","slug":"news","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5ae9f11fc994fd6b2518e1a7","revision":0,"createdAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modifiedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}},{"fields":{"name":"Business","slug":"business","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5ae9f120c639a3587939aa6f","revision":0,"createdAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modifiedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}}],"categories-tags":[{"fields":{"name":"elon musk","slug":"elon-musk","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5b4cb7ed32b3790c82c9b54b","revision":0,"createdAt":"July 16, 2018 11:21 am","modifiedAt":"July 16, 2018 11:21 am","revisionCreatedAt":"July 16, 2018 11:21 am","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}},{"fields":{"name":"tesla","slug":"tesla","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5b4cb80fb7dc810b67cf6f9f","revision":0,"createdAt":"July 16, 2018 11:21 am","modifiedAt":"July 16, 2018 11:21 am","revisionCreatedAt":"July 16, 2018 11:21 am","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}}],"contributorsAuthor":[{"fields":{"name":"William D.

They can have the job. Is there someone who can do the job better? They can have the reins right now.” Now, however, it appears that Tesla is poised to call his bluff, at least when it comes to appointing a No. 2. According to Bloomberg News, as part of a &lt;a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-08/the-hunt-is-on-for-a-musk-manager-as-tesla-accommodates-the-sec\"&gt;settlement&lt;/a&gt; with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Tesla has agreed to hire an independent chairman.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Musk, whose hubristic (and not entirely accurate) tweets about having secured funding to take Tesla private led to a lawsuit &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/09/elon-musks-tweets-just-got-him-sued\"&gt;from the S.E.C.&lt;/a&gt; last month, is currently both C.E.O. and chairman of the board of directors for Tesla, as well as for his rocket-making company, SpaceX. The S.E.C. wants Musk replaced as chairman, and has stipulated that two new independent directors be added to Tesla’s board, in an attempt to wrest some power away from Musk. The September 29 settlement will keep Musk from the chairman position for three years, Bloomberg reports.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In a perfect world, a new Tesla chairman will be able to both help Tesla achieve profitability, and manage the intractable Musk. (Despite his S.E.C. woes, Musk could not help himself from taunting the agency in a &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1047943670350020608\"&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; last week, writing, “Just want to [sic] that the Shortseller Enrichment Commission is doing incredible work. And the name change is so on point!”) Some names that have been floated, per Bloomberg, include &lt;strong&gt;Al Gore,&lt;/strong&gt; as well as former C.E.O.s like ex-Boeing chief executive &lt;strong&gt;Jim McNerney.&lt;/strong&gt; Experts say it makes more sense to hire a new director rather than picking from the existing slate of board members, many of whom aren’t truly independent and have ties to or investments in Musk’s companies. “If it’s one of the old directors, then you’re kind of back to where you started,” &lt;strong&gt;Charles Elson,&lt;/strong&gt; director of the John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware, told Bloomberg.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Tesla’s push to bring in an adult supervisor is by now part of a familiar pattern in Silicon Valley: a brilliant yet jejune founder takes a fledgling tech company through years of early growth, only to be bogged down by scandal and bailed out by a board-appointed guardian. Facebook had &lt;strong&gt;Sheryl Sandberg,&lt;/strong&gt; brought in in 2008 to transform &lt;strong&gt;Mark Zuckerberg’s&lt;/strong&gt; social network into an advertising-based business, and to act as the adult in the room. Uber shed &lt;strong&gt;Travis Kalanick&lt;/strong&gt; in 2017 amid a wide-ranging series of scandals involving its corporate culture, and hired Expedia C.E.O. &lt;strong&gt;Dara Khosrowshahi&lt;/strong&gt; to clean up its act. Twitter cycled through chief executives, eventually settling on the tried and tested &lt;strong&gt;Jack Dorsey,&lt;/strong&gt; who had already served as the company’s C.E.O. once before. Now, Musk’s reign of unchecked tweeting and rash decision-making may finally be brought to an end.&lt;/p&gt;","rubric":"Tesla","socialTitle":"Tesla Seeks Adult Supervision for Elon

The young Musk actually looks something like what one imagines an old Musk may look like a few decades from now&amp;#8212;hunched, balding, poorly dressed in an oversized blazer stolen from an AARP ad. But it’s easy to recognize a devilish streak clearly evident today. At the time, Musk had recently sold his software company, Zip2, for $400 million, a fraction of which he had spent on a present to himself: a McLaren F1. The CNN cameras observed the car being offloaded from a truck, and an excited Musk looking at his new toy in awe.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Some time later, as the fable now goes, Musk was trying to show off how fast the car could go to &lt;strong&gt;Peter Thiel,&lt;/strong&gt; his friend and co-founder of PayPal. Musk hit an embankment, sent the car several feet into the air, and almost totaled it. The part of the story that Musk now likes to tell with a little chuckle, and a lot of pride, is that he had “forgotten” to insure the car when that happened. Oh well!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Recently, Musk appears to have demonstrated a similar blithe recklessness at Tesla. During the past year, Musk tweeted an April Fool’s joke about Tesla going bankrupt; he referred to the man who rescued the kids trapped in a Thai cave as a pedophile; and he broke down in tears during a mildly deranged interview with &lt;em&gt;The New York Times.&lt;/em&gt; All this stoked outrage and vexation across social media, but he inarguably crossed a line when he tweeted that he had secured the financing to take Tesla private&amp;#8212;the sort of attention-grabbing ploy that the S.E.C. and institutional investors don’t find amusing.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Over the past week, Musk has faced the recriminations for his actions. He went from &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/09/elon-musks-tweets-just-got-him-sued\"&gt;being sued by the S.E.C.&lt;/a&gt; for allegedly making “false and misleading” statements to quickly settling with the organization after it became clear that a protracted fight &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/09/elon-musks-war-with-the-sec-could-cost-him-everything\"&gt;could cost him everything&lt;/a&gt;. Under the terms of the agreement, Musk will be allowed to remain C.E.O. but must resign as chairman of Tesla’s board and pay a $20 million fine. Tesla will also pay another $20 million fine, and must appoint two new independent directors to its board. (He can return as chairman in three years.)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;At Tesla, there are three common themes among current and former employees I’ve spoken to about Musk. First, many truly believe that Musk is brilliant&amp;#8212;a technical genius, a Renaissance man like Einstein or Teddy Roosevelt, who can solve massive problems almost extemporaneously. Second, many people seem to agree that Musk is also incredibly erratic. The employees who love Musk (and there are plenty), say this is just part of his brilliance. He is a mad scientist who is a little too electrified himself, prone to arrogance and egomania. Then there’s the third theme, which happens to be the most pervasive. There isn’t a single person that I’ve ever spoken with who works with, or has worked with, Musk, who doesn’t wish that he would just stop using Twitter. There have been almost half a dozen high-level employees at Tesla who have always cringed when Musk withdrew his phone and started tapping out 140- and 280-character missives without any control or oversight.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The integral part of Tesla’s settlement with the S.E.C. may assuage these concerns. As the settlement specifically notes, Tesla must “implement mandatory procedures and controls to oversee all of Elon Musk’s communications regarding the Company made in any format.” And any format means Twitter. This single stipulation might end up being the company’s biggest saving grace, and could even help end the mass exodus of executives over the past year.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the outside looking in, it appears that Musk is the kind of person who doesn’t like losing, or being told what to do. As my colleague &lt;strong&gt;Maya Kosoff&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/08/elon-musks-week-from-hell-ends-with-tears\"&gt;has reported&lt;/a&gt; over the past year, Musk’s indiscretions exceed what I’ve delineated above. He has repeatedly gotten himself into trouble &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/05/elon-musk-bizarre-tesla-earnings-call-just-cost-him-millions\"&gt;berating analysts&lt;/a&gt;; going on Trumpian rants against the media who reported facts Musk didn’t like; picking fights on Twitter with reporters who cover his company critically, and even &lt;a href=\"https://slate.com/business/2018/07/elon-musks-attacks-on-reporter-linette-lopez-need-to-stop.html\"&gt;occasionally accusing&lt;/a&gt; them of being in cahoots with short-sellers. So when the S.E.C. told him they wanted him to step down as chairman of Tesla for two years and pay a $10 million fine, which was the first request the oversight group made, Musk said no, forcing the agency’s hand.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But there’s also another theory about why Musk acts out. One that a former Tesla investor told me was why he pulled out of the company: he thinks Musk is more concerned with being famous than with building a successful business that stands the test of time, like Ford or General Motors. “In a similar way to Trump, Musk is someone who loves attention. They are the kind of people who love to be famous,” the investor said. In his mind, “Musk smoked that joint on &lt;em&gt;Joe Rogan&lt;/em&gt; to create a buzz. All publicity is good publicity, and the only thing he’s scared of the most is when you’re not talking about him.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Musk isn’t Henry Ford, this person contended; he’s &lt;strong&gt;Kanye West,&lt;/strong&gt; a star addicted to his own stardom who pulls the indecent levers of social media to amplify his audience and stroke his ego&amp;#8212;someone who will “do or say anything to the detriment of their lives, their companies, and the rest of us, as long as people are talking about them.” Ironically, as I type these words, it’s still working. As someone joked (I think it was a joke) on Twitter, “That tweet cost him approximately $327,868 per character.” One could say that’s a lot of money for a lot of nothing, but for Musk it was the cost of doing business to purchase a news cycle. “Musk’s erratic behavior isn’t going away because the attention he receives when he acts out isn’t going to go away,” a former investor told me.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But it seems that not all the investors in Tesla understand that. On Monday, after news of the settlement with the S.E.C. was announced, Tesla’s stock shot upwards by almost 50 points, a sign that investors are happy with the S.E.C. settlement, happy with a chairman that isn’t Musk, and likely even happier that Musk can’t make the stock go sideways with a single tweet. There are plenty of opportunities out there for investors, without having to deal with the erratic behavior of a C.E.O. who doesn’t seem to care if he totals his company. As I watched it all play out, I was reminded of a comment that Musk’s former fiancée made in that old CNN special. “My fear is that we become spoiled brats,” she said, “that we lose a sense of

S.E.C. slapped Tesla with a lawsuit on Thursday, accusing Musk of misleading investors when he tweeted his intention to take the electric-car company private.","body":"&lt;p&gt;Back in August, &lt;strong&gt;Elon Musk&lt;/strong&gt; sent a tweet that he likely believed would be history-making for his electric-car company. “Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured,” he wrote, hours after the &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt; reported that Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund had bought a 3- to 5-percent stake in Tesla. In fact, the tweet was life-altering&amp;#8212;just not in the way Musk had intended. Tesla’s stock price spiked that day, but the funding Musk claimed he’d obtained had not been secured. Musk had never presented a take-private plan to Tesla’s board, and just a few weeks later, he &lt;a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-is-not-going-private-elon-musk-announces-2018-8\"&gt;would announce&lt;/a&gt; that the plan had fallen through. Shortly thereafter, the Securities Exchange Commission opened an investigation into Musk and his company.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, that investigation produced concrete results: &lt;a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/389619859/US-Securities-and-Exchange-Commission-v-Elon-Musk\"&gt;in a lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; filed in Manhattan federal court on Thursday, the S.E.C. accused Musk of making “false and misleading” statements (including tweets like “Investor support is confirmed. Only reason why this is not certain is this is contingent on a shareholder vote”). According to the S.E.C., Musk’s tweets on August 7 threw the market into chaos, and harmed investors. “In truth and in fact, Musk had not even discussed, much less confirmed, key deal terms, including price, with any potential funding source,” the suit reads. If Musk is found guilty, he could be barred from serving as C.E.O. or director of the board of any public company. (Tesla is also expected to be sued, &lt;a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/27/tesla-falls-4percent-on-report-elon-musk-sued-by-sec.html\"&gt;according to CNBC&lt;/a&gt;, though the company was not named as a defendant in the S.E.C. complaint&amp;#8212;Tesla did not respond to &lt;a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-27/elon-musk-is-sued-by-securities-and-exchange-commission-docket-jml0ca0m\"&gt;Bloomberg’s&lt;/a&gt; request for comment.)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;At various points, Musk has attempted to explain the tweet away, denying that he sent it on purpose, to screw over Tesla short-sellers. He initially wrote in a blog post that he had been in talks with the Saudi Arabian sovereign wealth fund, and that after those talks, he was confident the fund would bankroll Tesla’s take-private plan. Later, in an emotional interview with &lt;em&gt;The New York Times,&lt;/em&gt; he said he’d arrived at $420&amp;#8212;a number typically associated with marijuana&amp;#8212;by adding a dollar to the $419 he’d determined would’ve constituted a 20-percent premium on the day’s closing Tesla share price. &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/ceodonovan/status/1045422260176089088\"&gt;According to the S.E.C. co-director of enforcement&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Steven Peikin,&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-27/musk-picked-weed-linked-price-to-impress-girlfriend-sec-says\"&gt;the S.E.C. alleges that&lt;/a&gt; Musk rounded up because he thought his girlfriend “would find it funny, which admittedly is not a great reason to pick a price.” At the time, the announcement both &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/08/is-elon-musk-winging-his-take-private-plan\"&gt;surprised and alarmed&lt;/a&gt; Tesla’s board, adding credence to the possibility that it had not been pre-planned.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The suit, unsurprisingly, came as a blow to the Tesla C.E.O., who has weathered a seemingly endless series of self-inflicted controversy. “This unjustified action by the S.E.C. leaves me deeply saddened and disappointed,” Musk said in a &lt;a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-27/elon-musk-is-sued-by-securities-and-exchange-commission-docket-jml0ca0m\"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; to Bloomberg. “I have always taken action in the best interests of truth, transparency, and investors. Integrity is the most important value in my life and the facts will show I never compromised this in any way.” Tesla shares fell as much as 10 percent in after-hours trading, costing the company more than $5 billion in market cap.&lt;/p&gt;","rubric":"Elon Musk","socialTitle":"Elon Musk’s Tweets Just Got Him Sued","socialDescription":"The S.E.C. slapped Tesla with a lawsuit on Thursday, accusing Musk of misleading investors when he tweeted his intention to take the electric-car company private.","seoTitle":"Elon Musk’s Tweets Just Got Him Sued","seoDescription":"The S.E.C. slapped Tesla with a lawsuit on Thursday, accusing Musk of misleading investors when he tweeted his intention to take the electric-car company private.","channel":"News","subChannel":"Tech","issueDate":"","ledeCaption":"","contentSource":"web","canonicalUrl":"","contentType":"","textMimeType":"","tags":["elon musk","tesla","fraud","SEC"],"revisionAuthor":"Maya Kosoff","meta":{"collectionName":"articles","modelName":"article","publishable":true,"identifiable":true,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":true,"hierarchical":false},"interactiveOverride":"","id":"5bad47fb87834306acdc6723","revision":9,"createdAt":"September 27, 2018 5:13 pm","modifiedAt":"September 27, 2018 6:41 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"September 27, 2018 6:41 pm","_embedded":{"categories-channels":[{"fields":{"name":"News","slug":"news","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5ae9f11fc994fd6b2518e1a7","revision":0,"createdAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modifiedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}},{"fields":{"name":"Tech","slug":"tech","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5ae9f120c994fd6b2518e1a8","revision":0,"createdAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modifiedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}}],"categories-tags":[{"fields":{"name":"elon musk","slug":"elon-musk","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5b4cb7ed32b3790c82c9b54b","revision":0,"createdAt":"July 16, 2018 11:21 am","modifiedAt":"July 16, 2018 11:21 am","revisionCreatedAt":"July 16, 2018 11:21 am","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}},{"fields":{"name":"tesla","slug":"tesla","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5b4cb80fb7dc810b67cf6f9f","revision":0,"createdAt":"July 16, 2018 11:21 am","modifiedAt":"July 16, 2018 11:21 am","revisionCreatedAt":"July 16, 2018 11:21 am","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}},{"fields":{"name":"fraud","slug":"fraud","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5b4cba2922e5400b9d093131","revision":0,"createdAt":"July 16, 2018 11:30 am","modifiedAt":"July 16, 2018 11:30 am","revisionCreatedAt":"July 16, 2018 11:30 am","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}},{"fields":{"name":"SEC","slug":"sec","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5b4cb7f7b7dc810b67cf6f7f","revision":0,"createdAt":"July 16, 2018 11:21 am","modifiedAt":"July 16, 2018 11:21 am","revisionCreatedAt":"July 16, 2018 11:21 am","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}}],"contributorsAuthor":[{"fields":{"revisionAuthor":"Maya Kosoff","name":"Maya Kosoff","bio":"Maya Kosoff writes about tech for VF.com.

But it’s also his Achilles’ heel.","body":"&lt;p&gt;This summer, the story of a Thai soccer team trapped in a cave ended happily, when all 12 players and their coach were rescued by divers. But &lt;strong&gt;Elon Musk&lt;/strong&gt; was less than thrilled. Spurned by the Thai government when he attempted to save the day with his own “kid-size submarine” and crew, he baselessly accused one of the rescuers&amp;#8212;&lt;strong&gt;Vernon Unsworth,&lt;/strong&gt; a British cave diver who was openly critical of Musk’s efforts&amp;#8212;of being a pedophile. In the following weeks, Musk apologized, but ultimately doubled down on his arrogant, baseless accusation, at various points reigniting a controversy that shouldn’t have existed to begin with. “You don’t think it’s strange he hasn’t sued me?” he &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1034481160783585280\"&gt;said on Twitter in August&lt;/a&gt; referring to Unsworth. “He was offered free legal services.” Weeks later, Unsworth &lt;a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/elon-musk-sued-thai-cave-rescue-pedo-vernon-unsworth-lawsuit-football-team-a8542046.html\"&gt;filed a defamation lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; against Musk. (Musk did not comment on the defamation suit.)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It would hardly be the last time Musk’s ego came back to bite him. On Thursday, the Tesla C.E.O. &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/09/elon-musks-tweets-just-got-him-sued\"&gt;was sued&lt;/a&gt; by the S.E.C. for allegedly making “false and misleading” statements when he announced via Twitter in August that he’d secured funding to take Tesla private. (Although Musk did meet with representatives for Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund, the group opted against backing Tesla’s take-private plan). The fraud lawsuit, Musk &lt;a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/27/elon-musk-calls-sec-fraud-lawsuit-unjustified-says-he-acted-in-best-interests-of-investors.html\"&gt;said on Thursday&lt;/a&gt;, is “unjustified.” Tesla’s board, too, is standing by Musk. If found guilty, Musk could be banned from serving as C.E.O. or director of the board of any public company.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But according to CNBC’s &lt;strong&gt;Andrew Ross Sorkin,&lt;/strong&gt; the lawsuit could have been avoided entirely. On Friday morning, Sorkin &lt;a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/28/teslas-musk-pulled-plug-on-settlement-with-sec-at-last-minute.html\"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that Musk had been on the verge of a settlement with the S.E.C. that wouldn’t have put his job on the line. Under the terms of the settlement, Musk and Tesla would reportedly have had to pay a nominal fine, but Musk wouldn’t have had to admit any wrongdoing. However, the agreement would have barred Musk from being chairman of his company for two years, and Tesla would have to appoint new independent directors. Sources familiar with the matter told CNBC that Musk decided to pull out of the deal at the last minute because he felt that “by settling he would not be truthful to himself.” The S.E.C. declined to comment, and Tesla was not immediately available for comment.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; On Saturday, the Securities and Exchange Commission announced that Musk had settled the lawsuit. Under the terms of the agreement, Musk will be allowed to remain C.E.O. but must resign as chairman of Tesla’s board and pay a $20 million fine. Tesla will also pay another $20 million fine to the S.E.C., and must appoint two new independent directors to its board. Musk would be able to return to his chairman position after a three year ban.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Musk’s pride, of course, is also the very thing that propelled Tesla to its current lofty position in the tech world. His vision is intrinsically tied to the company’s success&amp;#8212;so much so that &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-tesla-without-elon-musk-would-threaten-electric-car-makers-future-1538127006\"&gt;fretted&lt;/a&gt; on Friday that “If Mr. Musk were forced to step down . . . Tesla would be left without the visionary entrepreneur who has captivated investors with his grand ambition to replace the internal combustion engine with electric, self-driving systems.” (Shares of Tesla dropped more than 10 percent in early trading Friday morning.) There’s no doubt that Musk has made society-changing contributions, revolutionizing both space travel and environmentally friendly vehicles. But the way Musk responds when he’s challenged shows how dangerous his ego can be. When Tesla drivers have died while using Tesla’s autopilot function, Musk has found it within himself to blame both the &lt;a href=\"https://slate.com/technology/2018/05/elon-musk-blames-journalists-for-teslas-problems-fine-ill-write-an-article-his-way.html\"&gt;media&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/greggardner/2018/04/12/when-your-product-fails-blame-the-customer-the-tesla-way/#7f59f880218e\"&gt;victim&lt;/a&gt;. He has &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/05/elon-musk-bizarre-tesla-earnings-call-just-cost-him-millions\"&gt;blown up&lt;/a&gt; at analysts who asked fairly routine questions during an earnings calls.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The S.E.C.’s investigation into Musk was never a particularly good look for a man who’s frequently raged against short-sellers. But by refusing to comply with the agency, he’s now essentially put his own job&amp;#8212;and any other job at the head of a publicly held company&amp;#8212;on the line.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article has been updated.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","rubric":"Tesla","socialTitle":"Elon Musk’s War with the S.E.C.

But the P.R. blitz may not be enough to keep his problems at bay.","body":"&lt;p&gt;Japanese billionaire &lt;strong&gt;Yusaku Maezawa&lt;/strong&gt; made his name as a &lt;a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-45557840\"&gt;drummer&lt;/a&gt; in a hardcore punk band, made his fortune in online fashion, and now wants to &lt;a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/18/science/spacex-moon-yusaku-maezawa.html\"&gt;make history&lt;/a&gt; by becoming the first man to circle the moon, accompanied by a small entourage of artists and performers. On Monday, Maezawa appeared on the SpaceX factory floor next to &lt;strong&gt;Elon Musk&lt;/strong&gt; to announce their lyrically titled mission, Dear Moon, which will not take place until 2023, at the earliest. Musk declined to disclose the exact amount Maezawa had forked over for the honor, but allowed that “a very significant deposit” had been made for a flight aboard SpaceX’s ambitious B.F.R. (“B” for big; “R” for rocket). Maezawa, it seems, is in it for the notoriety&amp;#8212;according to &lt;em&gt;The New York Times,&lt;/em&gt; he told Musk he’s willing to wait years for the rocket, as long as he’s the first “private person” to make it to the moon. “I want to contribute to society in a different way,” he told reporters, of the cadre of artists he hopes to bring along. “These artists will be asked to create something after they return to Earth, and these masterpieces will inspire the dreamer within all of us.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;While there seems to be a natural symbiosis between the two flamboyant entrepreneurs, for Musk, Monday’s press conference served a dual purpose: to deflect attention from the series of scandals plaguing his personal and professional life, which have shaken the confidence of Tesla investors. In the past several weeks, he has choked up in a &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; interview, smoked pot on &lt;strong&gt;Joe Rogan’s&lt;/strong&gt; podcast (“Weed is not helpful for productivity,” he &lt;a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/16/business/elon-musk-interview-tesla.html\"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;em&gt;Times.&lt;/em&gt; “There’s a reason for the word ‘stoned.’ You just sit there like a stone on weed”), and sparked an S.E.C. investigation by falsely tweeting that he had secured funding to take Tesla private. The deluge has not relented: on Monday afternoon, &lt;strong&gt;Vernon Unsworth,&lt;/strong&gt; the cave diver who Musk repeatedly called a “pedo” and a “child rapist,” filed a &lt;a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/elon-musk-sued-for-defamation-by-cave-diver-over-pedo-r-1829114136\"&gt;lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; for defamation, seeking an injunction against Musk that would prohibit him from making similar comments. And on Tuesday, Bloomberg &lt;a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-18/tesla-is-said-to-face-u-s-criminal-probe-over-musk-statements\"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that the Department of Justice is likewise investigating Musk’s take-private tweet, a probe that could potentially result in criminal charges. (Tesla’s stock fell on the news.)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Concerns that Musk’s antics might negatively impact his business dealings were seemingly confirmed by an &lt;a href=\"https://www.axios.com/tesla-elon-musk-lucid-saudi-arabia-0db891b7-28d4-446b-8cd9-41edb9831f53.html\"&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt;, shortly after Unsworth filed his suit, that electric-vehicle start-up Lucid will receive more than $1 billion from the Saudi Arabian government&amp;#8212;the same fund that Musk had claimed would finance Tesla’s privatization. And as Tesla battles losses and kinks in its production line, &lt;a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2018/09/17/elon-musk-sued-defamation-by-thai-cave-rescue-volunteer-he-called-child-rapist/\"&gt;rumors&lt;/a&gt; of the company’s quest to add to its executive branch have continued to swirl. In the past, Musk’s penchant for &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/02/elon-musk-greatest-showman-on-earth\"&gt;dazzling showmanship&lt;/a&gt; has been enough to soothe concerned parties, reassuring them that the billionaire C.E.O. still has his edge. But though he tried to recapture some of the old magic on Monday&amp;#8212;“This is a dangerous mission,” he said cinematically, “definitely dangerous”&amp;#8212;it may not be enough to stave off his long, long list of woes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;At the very least, though, it may have given the beleaguered Musk a spiritual boost. After weathering months of self-inflicted controversy, Maezawa’s investment, he told reporters, had “done a lot to restore my faith in humanity.”&lt;/p&gt;","rubric":"Elon Musk","socialTitle":"Can Space Tourism Save Elon Musk?","socialDescription":"The volatile Tesla and SpaceX C.E.O. announced the name of his first space tourist.

Just hours after C.E.O. &lt;strong&gt;Elon Musk&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/09/elon-musk-smokes-weed-and-predicts-the-end-of-the-world\"&gt;smoked a blunt&lt;/a&gt; on an almost-three-hour-long segment of &lt;strong&gt;Joe Rogan’s&lt;/strong&gt; podcast, news broke that two of the company’s senior executives would step down, one of whom had started just a month prior, the day before Musk sent out a now-infamous tweet announcing he had secured funds to take Tesla private. If possible, the departures&amp;#8212;not to mention the constant fear that Musk may tweet himself into yet another controversy&amp;#8212;have put investors on even higher alert, necessitating a great deal of patience as they wait to see whether Tesla can do what it has promised: produce electric cars at scale.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;At least two firms remain bullish on this mission, erratic C.E.O. notwithstanding. On Monday, Tesla’s stock price surged more than &lt;a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/10/tesla-shares-climb-8-percent-after-two-bullish-analyst-reports.html\"&gt;8 percent&lt;/a&gt; after a pair of positive reports from analysts at Baird and Bernstein, who believe in the strength of Tesla’s manufacturing capabilities and favorable market sentiment. “We think the [Tesla] setup in sentiment looks relatively favorable for the next few weeks,” Bernstein analyst &lt;strong&gt;Toni Sacconaghi&lt;/strong&gt; wrote to clients in a note Monday. “We now see the near-term risk-reward for Tesla as relatively skewed to the upside, given the potential for the stock to revert towards the middle of its $270 to $370 range.” In a note titled “Tesla, Inc.: Buy Even with Drama in LBC,” Baird analyst &lt;strong&gt;Ben Kallo&lt;/strong&gt; recounted a tour of Tesla’s Fremont factory, where Musk is said to sleep in order to help hit production deadlines. “We . . . came away incrementally positive,” &lt;a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/10/buy-tesla-shares-even-with-drama-baird-analyst-says-after-factory-tour.html\"&gt;Kallo wrote&lt;/a&gt;, urging clients to buy Tesla stock in spite of the seemingly endless swirl of Musk drama. “Gigafactory 1 creates a significant barrier for competition and manufacturing capability should be a competitive advantage for TSLA over the long term. We believe TSLA’s Gigafactory enables the company to drive down costs through an industrialization of battery pack assembly and economies of scale.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But not everyone is so willing to overlook the behavior of Musk, who in recent months has, among other things, baselessly asserted and re-asserted that a British cave diver is a pedophile; floated conspiracy theories about journalists and short-sellers; and become the subject of an S.E.C. investigation. Nomura Instinet, a firm formerly bullish on Tesla, &lt;a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/11/former-big-bull-on-tesla-says-the-stock-is-no-longer-investable-due-to-elon-musks-behavior.html\"&gt;downgraded&lt;/a&gt; its rating from buy to neutral on Tuesday morning. Tesla is “no longer investable” due to Musk’s behavior, wrote analyst &lt;strong&gt;Romit Shah.&lt;/strong&gt; “We have been one of the most bullish on TSLA shares since initiating coverage last October. . . . We continue to believe that Tesla could be a lot bigger than it is today,” he said. “The issue though is the erratic behavior of C.E.O. Elon Musk. During the second quarter, the switch seemingly flipped. . . . We are worried that this behavior is tainting the Tesla brand, which in terms of value is most important.” Shah enumerates several of Musk’s public outbursts&amp;#8212;his emotional &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; interview; an outburst earlier this year during which he berated analysts for asking “boring” questions; haranguing short-sellers; the aforementioned “cave-diver accusation”; and his Rogan podcast appearance. All of these were factors that “likely contributed to the onslaught of executive departures in recent months,” Shah wrote. “Notwithstanding improving fundamentals, we believe that Tesla is in need of better leadership (an about-face) and are moving to the sidelines until we see what happens with management.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The first two firms, it seems, see Tesla as an entity separate from Musk, while the third does not. Judged purely on its business model, Tesla seems like a fair bet: its manufacturing model is viable, and its technology still has the potential to revolutionize the motor-vehicle industry. But if the company’s C.E.O. is factored in, the warning lights start blinking. Musk is widely viewed as an avatar for the company he founded, and his truest believers can’t fathom a Tesla without him. The question then becomes: are they right? Are Tesla investors simply betting on the company, or are they gambling on Elon Musk, the man? The answer, of course, depends on Musk himself. As long as he refuses to delegate responsibility, it would seem that a gamble on Tesla is very much a gamble on its C.E.O.&lt;/p&gt;","rubric":"Tesla","socialTitle":"Can Tesla Exist Without Elon Musk?","socialDescription":"A dueling pair of new analyst reports shows Wall Street is divided on the significance of Musk’s meltdowns.","seoTitle":"Can Tesla Exist Without Elon Musk?","seoDescription":"A dueling pair of new analyst reports shows Wall Street is divided on the significance of Musk’s meltdowns.","channel":"News","subChannel":"Tech","issueDate":"","ledeCaption":"","contentSource":"web","canonicalUrl":"","tags":["tesla","elon musk"],"meta":{"collectionName":"articles","modelName":"article","publishable":true,"identifiable":true,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":true,"hierarchical":false},"contentType":"","interactiveOverride":"","textMimeType":"","id":"5b97d7753da10f6999db8a92","revision":3,"createdAt":"September 11, 2018 10:55 am","modifiedAt":"September 11, 2018 10:57 am","revisionCreatedAt":"September 11, 2018 10:57 am","_embedded":{"categories-channels":[{"fields":{"name":"News","slug":"news","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5ae9f11fc994fd6b2518e1a7","revision":0,"createdAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modifiedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}},{"fields":{"name":"Tech","slug":"tech","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5ae9f120c994fd6b2518e1a8","revision":0,"createdAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modifiedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}}],"categories-tags":[{"fields":{"name":"tesla","slug":"tesla","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5b4cb80fb7dc810b67cf6f9f","revision":0,"createdAt":"July 16, 2018 11:21 am","modifiedAt":"July 16, 2018 11:21 am","revisionCreatedAt":"July 16, 2018 11:21 am","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}},{"fields":{"name":"elon musk","slug":"elon-musk","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5b4cb7ed32b3790c82c9b54b","revision":0,"createdAt":"July 16, 2018 11:21 am","modifiedAt":"July 16, 2018 11:21 am","revisionCreatedAt":"July 16, 2018 11:21 am","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}}],"contributorsAuthor":[{"fields":{"revisionAuthor":"Maya Kosoff","name":"Maya Kosoff","bio":"Maya Kosoff writes about tech for VF.com.

The company’s C.E.O., who this past spring bluntly &lt;a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/27/car-biz-is-hell-and-humans-are-underrated-elon-musks-best-quotes-so-far-this-year.html\"&gt;proclaimed&lt;/a&gt; “Car biz is hell” amid reports that he had begun sleeping on the Tesla factory floor, seems midway through a downward spiral that in recent weeks has included going on a Trumpian anti-media rant; baselessly asserting that a man who helped rescue the Thai soccer team trapped in a cave is a pedophile; apologizing for those remarks, only to &lt;a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/elon-musk-thai-cave-rescuer-accusations-buzzfeed-email\"&gt;renew them&lt;/a&gt; by calling the same man a “child rapist”; falsely tweeting that he had secured funding to take Tesla private; becoming the subject of an S.E.C. investigation; and &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/08/elon-musks-week-from-hell-ends-with-tears\"&gt;breaking down&lt;/a&gt; in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The New York Times.&lt;/em&gt; At this point, &lt;strong&gt;Elon Musk&lt;/strong&gt; seems &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/08/elon-musks-week-from-hell-ends-with-tears\"&gt;resistant&lt;/a&gt; to the idea of sharing leadership responsibilities, and well beyond the control of anyone at Tesla who could possibly stop his parade of self-sabotage. So it comes as little surprise that on Thursday evening, he and comedian &lt;strong&gt;Joe Rogan&lt;/strong&gt; spent more than two and a half hours taping the latter’s podcast, where Musk did little to put investors’ minds at ease.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"embed block social-instagram row\"&gt;&lt;blockquote class=\"embed instagram-embed-component instagram-media \" data-instgrm-captioned=\"true\" data-instgrm-version=\"2\" data-type=\"instagram\" data-url=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BnaVnGNHs8I/?utm_source=ig_embed\"&gt;&lt;div class=\"instagram-media-container\"&gt;&lt;div class=\"instagram-media-wrapper\"&gt;&lt;div class=\"instagram-media-inner\"&gt;&lt;div class=\"instagram-media-view\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class=\"instagram-media-loading\"&gt;Loading&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class=\"instagram-media-more\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BnaVnGNHs8I/?utm_source=ig_embed\" target=\"blank\"&gt;View on Instagram&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;At various points during the &lt;a href=\"https://money.cnn.com/2018/09/07/technology/elon-musk-joe-rogan/index.html\"&gt;taping&lt;/a&gt;, Musk smoked marijuana (recreationally legal in California, where Rogan’s podcast is recorded), drank whiskey, and discussed the end of the universe. “Nobody listened,” he lamented, when he tried to warn the government about the dangers of A.I. At another point, he argued that mankind is already living in a Matrix of its own: “If you assume any rate of improvement at all, then games will be indistinguishable from reality, or civilization will end,” he said. “One of those two things will occur. Therefore, we are most likely in a simulation, because we exist.” At another point, he described the “never-ending explosion” of ideas in his brain, which is “very hard” to turn off.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;That ceaseless tide of genius, Musk implied, is responsible for his various ventures&amp;#8212;and more may very well be on the horizon. His newest idea, he told Rogan, is a series of designs for a supersonic electric plane that would take off and land vertically. But the man who is concurrently running three other companies says not to expect said plane anytime soon. “I have a lot on my plate,” he admitted. “An electric plane isn’t important right now.” Of Neuralink, a 2016 venture that develops computer interfaces to be implanted in human brains, Musk teased, “I think we’ll have something interesting to announce in a few months that’s at least an order of magnitude better than anything else. Probably better than anyone thinks is possible.” Musk has previously said that humans and machines must develop a symbiotic relationship before it’s too late, a sentiment he echoed in the interview. Facebook and Twitter, he said, are examples of “cybernetic collectives of people and machines,” in which humans are “plugged in like nodes on a network, leaves on a big tree.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;He was less optimistic about other ventures. The Boring Company, which is currently spending millions of dollars in an attempt to dig a giant tunnel beneath Los Angeles to alleviate traffic, may work&amp;#8212;or it may not! “We are going to build a tunnel, and maybe that tunnel will be successful. And maybe it won’t,” Musk said. “I’m not trying to convince you it’s going to work&amp;#8212;or anyone . . . But so far, I’ve lived in L.A. for 16 years, and the traffic has always been terrible. And so I don’t see any other ideas for improving the traffic.” (Los Angeles, he noted, is “a terrible place to dig tunnels . . . mostly because of paperwork.”)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Though Rogan’s podcast may very well have allowed Musk to blow off some steam (he also demonstrated a Boring Company flamethrower), it apparently shook investors, who were &lt;a href=\"https://money.cnn.com/2018/08/17/news/companies/tesla-stock/index.html?iid=EL\"&gt;alarmed&lt;/a&gt; last month when Musk lamented to the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; that he spent his entire birthday at work, and takes Ambien to fall asleep. Hours after Musk’s interview, news broke that two senior executives would be departing Tesla. Onetime head of human resources, &lt;strong&gt;Gabrielle Toledano,&lt;/strong&gt; won’t be returning, &lt;a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-07/tesla-chief-accounting-officer-leaves-citing-level-of-scrutiny?srnd=premium\"&gt;Bloomberg reports&lt;/a&gt;, and Chief Accounting Officer &lt;strong&gt;Dave Morton,&lt;/strong&gt; who started one day before Musk sent out his “funding secured” tweet last month, is also leaving. Shares of Tesla sunk &lt;a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/07/tesla-sinks-8percent-after-bizarre-musk-podcast-appearance-cao-exit.html\"&gt;nearly 10 percent&lt;/a&gt; Friday morning after Musk’s interview and Morton’s unexpected resignation.&lt;/p&gt;","rubric":"Elon Musk","socialTitle":"Elon Musk Smokes Weed and Predicts the End of the World","socialDescription":"Is the Tesla C.E.O. trying to drive investors crazy?","seoTitle":"Elon Musk Smokes Weed and Predicts the End of the World","seoDescription":"Tesla stock plummets after Musk’s appearance on Joe Rogan’s podcast and the unexpected resignation of the company’s chief accounting officer.","channel":"News","subChannel":"Tech","issueDate":"","ledeCaption":"","contentSource":"web","canonicalUrl":"","tags":["elon musk","tesla","podcast"],"meta":{"collectionName":"articles","modelName":"article","publishable":true,"identifiable":true,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":true,"hierarchical":false},"contentType":"","interactiveOverride":"","textMimeType":"","id":"5b929404a0a7dc5016623488","revision":4,"createdAt":"September 7, 2018 11:06 am","modifiedAt":"September 7, 2018 11:14 am","revisionCreatedAt":"September 7, 2018 11:14 am","_embedded":{"categories-channels":[{"fields":{"name":"News","slug":"news","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5ae9f11fc994fd6b2518e1a7","revision":0,"createdAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modifiedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}},{"fields":{"name":"Tech","slug":"tech","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5ae9f120c994fd6b2518e1a8","revision":0,"createdAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modifiedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}}],"categories-tags":[{"fields":{"name":"elon musk","slug":"elon-musk","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5b4cb7ed32b3790c82c9b54b","revision":0,"createdAt":"July 16, 2018 11:21 am","modifiedAt":"July 16, 2018 11:21 am","revisionCreatedAt":"July 16, 2018 11:21 am","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}},{"fields":{"name":"tesla","slug":"tesla","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5b4cb80fb7dc810b67cf6f9f","revision":0,"createdAt":"July 16, 2018 11:21 am","modifiedAt":"July 16, 2018 11:21 am","revisionCreatedAt":"July 16, 2018 11:21 am","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}},{"fields":{"name":"podcast","slug":"podcast","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5b4cb7e34f46c70bca18e2d7","revision":0,"createdAt":"July 16, 2018 11:21 am","modifiedAt":"July 16, 2018 11:21 am","revisionCreatedAt":"July 16, 2018 11:21 am","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}}],"contributorsAuthor":[{"fields":{"revisionAuthor":"Maya Kosoff","name":"Maya Kosoff","bio":"Maya Kosoff writes about tech for VF.com.

Musk&lt;/strong&gt; may be working a 120-hour week, but the Tesla C.E.O. nevertheless found time on Tuesday to pose several probing questions on Twitter. Last month, he tangled with &lt;strong&gt;Vern Unsworth,&lt;/strong&gt; a British cave diver who helped save a Thai youth soccer team, and who criticized Musk’s own harebrained attempt at a rescue mission, baselessly accusing him of being a pedophile. He was forced to apologize to the diver (“My words were spoken in anger after Mr. Unsworth said several untruths &amp;amp; suggested I engage in a sexual act with the mini-sub,” he &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1019471467304513537\"&gt;tweeted on July 17&lt;/a&gt;), but more than a month later, Musk is back at it, goaded by former tech writer &lt;strong&gt;Drew Olanoff,&lt;/strong&gt; who said in response to Musk’s insistence that he did not actually shed tears during a recent &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; interview that the executive’s “dedication to facts and truth would have been wonderful if applied to that time when you called someone a pedo.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Given the tenuous state of his electric-car enterprise, it may have been advisable for Musk to sit this round out. Instead, he implied that perhaps Unsworth indeed had something to hide. “You don’t think it’s strange he hasn’t sued me?” he &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1034481160783585280\"&gt;retorted&lt;/a&gt;. “He was offered free legal services.” Olanoff responded: “I think a lot of things are strange, Elon. What I think is especially strange here is that you’re wondering why he hasn’t sued you while the rest of us are wondering why you did something so egregious that he could sue you for in the first place.” The conversation could have ended there, but Musk had other plans. “Did you investigate at all? I’m guessing answer is no. Why? Answer the question @yoda,” &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1034482379992301568\"&gt;he said&lt;/a&gt;, tagging Olanoff’s Twitter handle. “You brought it up, not me. Did you investigate or not? If so, what did you actually do?”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Tesla did not respond to a request for comment, but the bizarre tweets come just a couple of weeks after Musk’s melodramatic &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/08/elon-musks-week-from-hell-ends-with-tears\"&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;em&gt;Times,&lt;/em&gt; in which he lamented the many sacrifices he has made to keep Tesla up and running: almost missing his brother &lt;strong&gt;Kimbal’s&lt;/strong&gt; wedding; rarely seeing his kids; working the entirety of his birthday. “This past year has been the most difficult and painful year of my career,” Musk told the &lt;em&gt;Times.&lt;/em&gt; “It was excruciating.” He added, “I thought the worst of it was over&amp;#8212;I thought it was. The worst is over from a Tesla operational standpoint. But from a personal pain standpoint, the worst is yet to come.” The interview followed a months-long streak of erratic behavior from Musk that seemingly culminated in his decision to make a monumental announcement on Twitter: that he had secured funding to take Tesla private. The announcement &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/08/is-elon-musk-winging-his-take-private-plan\"&gt;surprised and alarmed&lt;/a&gt; Tesla’s board and, despite Musk’s many attempts to explain it away, fueled a full-blown S.E.C. investigation into whether or not he had sent the tweet to deliberately screw short-sellers.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Moreover, Musk’s unpredictable outbursts are having a material effect on his company. Tesla’s stock prices fell following the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; interview, and over the weekend Musk announced that the take-private deal was off after a tepid response from investors. All of which comes on top of skepticism from Wall Street that Tesla has long-term viability&amp;#8212;one analyst recently &lt;a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/tesla-stock-price-volatility-could-cost-millions-in-lost-investments-analys-2018-8-1027490446\"&gt;slashed&lt;/a&gt; his target price for Tesla shares over concerns about the company’s looming mountain of corporate debt. “Tesla will need to secure profitability by the end of the year to maintain solvency,” he wrote in a note, adding that at its current rate Tesla “only has enough cash to maintain operations for another six to nine months.” Add in the fact that Tesla is currently under investigation based on reports from several former employees-turned-whistleblowers (all of which the company has contested), and it becomes clearer than ever that stable leadership is crucial for Tesla during a period of turbulence that’s partially self-imposed. “I’ve never seen a share price more tethered to a C.E.O., and I’ve never seen a C.E.O. who is more untethered from reality,” one Tesla investor recently &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/05/elon-musk-having-his-kanye-west-moment\"&gt;told my colleague&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Nick Bilton.&lt;/strong&gt; “Elon Musk is clearly more of a genius than Steve Jobs ever was, but Steve was more of a pro than Elon Musk has ever been.”&lt;/p&gt;","rubric":"Tesla","socialTitle":"Has Elon Musk’s Twitter Habit Become a Liability?","socialDescription":"The Tesla C.E.O. has once again taken up his bizarre vendetta against a British cave diver, to the (likely) chagrin of investors.","seoTitle":"Has Elon Musk’s Twitter Habit Become a Liability?","seoDescription":"The Tesla C.E.O. has once again taken up his bizarre vendetta against a British cave diver, to the (likely) chagrin of investors.","channel":"News","subChannel":"Tech","issueDate":"","ledeCaption":"","contentSource":"web","canonicalUrl":"","tags":["tesla","elon musk"],"meta":{"collectionName":"articles","modelName":"article","publishable":true,"identifiable":true,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":true,"hierarchical":false},"contentType":"","interactiveOverride":"","textMimeType":"","id":"5b85bf1141603640ab8d5ff9","revision":11,"createdAt":"August 28, 2018 5:30 pm","modifiedAt":"August 28, 2018 6:25 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"August 28, 2018 6:25 pm","_embedded":{"categories-channels":[{"fields":{"name":"News","slug":"news","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5ae9f11fc994fd6b2518e1a7","revision":0,"createdAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modifiedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}},{"fields":{"name":"Tech","slug":"tech","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5ae9f120c994fd6b2518e1a8","revision":0,"createdAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modifiedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}}],"categories-tags":[{"fields":{"name":"tesla","slug":"tesla","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5b4cb80fb7dc810b67cf6f9f","revision":0,"createdAt":"July 16, 2018 11:21 am","modifiedAt":"July 16, 2018 11:21 am","revisionCreatedAt":"July 16, 2018 11:21 am","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}},{"fields":{"name":"elon musk","slug":"elon-musk","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5b4cb7ed32b3790c82c9b54b","revision":0,"createdAt":"July 16, 2018 11:21 am","modifiedAt":"July 16, 2018 11:21 am","revisionCreatedAt":"July 16, 2018 11:21 am","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}}],"contributorsAuthor":[{"fields":{"revisionAuthor":"Maya Kosoff","name":"Maya Kosoff","bio":"Maya Kosoff writes about tech for VF.com.
