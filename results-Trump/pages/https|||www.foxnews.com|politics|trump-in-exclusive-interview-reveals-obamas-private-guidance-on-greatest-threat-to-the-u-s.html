Rick Scott won Florida."</p><p>The results of a manual recount in the Florida Senate were reported on Sunday, and Scott prevailed over Democratic incumbent Sen.

The president noted he <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-speaking-at-armistice-day-event-xx">attended an event the next day in the rain</a> at a cemetery just outside Paris on Armistice Day.</p><p>"They said, 'Sir,' the Secret Service said, 'Sir, you cannot go. We are not prepared. You cannot go,'" Trump said. "Because it was supposed to be helicopter, but the helicopter couldn’t fly because of zero visibility."</p><p>Calling media reports that he is bitter and resentful following the midterm elections nothing more than "disgusting fake news," Trump next addressed some potential high-level departures from his administration.</p><p>On Department of Homeland Security head Kirstjen Nielsen, Trump suggested he wants to see an improvement on border security. The first members of a large Central American migrant caravan arrived in the Mexican city of Tijuana last week and were photographed attempting to climb a border fence there.</p><div source="" class="image-ct inline"><div class="m"><picture><source media="(max-width: 767px)" srcset="https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/11/1470/828/ContentBroker_contentid-99b69eb80b0a4c21a41be7fd2ee68cdb.png?ve=1&amp;tl=1 2x" /><source media="(min-width: 767px)" srcset="https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/11/1862/1048/ContentBroker_contentid-99b69eb80b0a4c21a41be7fd2ee68cdb.png?ve=1&amp;tl=1 2x" /><img src="https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/11/640/320/ContentBroker_contentid-99b69eb80b0a4c21a41be7fd2ee68cdb.png?ve=1&amp;tl=1" alt="A Catholic nun gives travel advice to Central American migrants riding in the bed of a semi-trailer, as they move toward the U.S. border, in Ixtlán del Rio, Nayarit, Mexico, Tuesday, Nov. 13, 2018.

He’s doing an excellent job in many ways. There are a couple of things where it’s just not his strength. It’s not his fault, it’s not his strength. ... But John, at some point, is going to want to move on. John will move on."</p><p>Multiple reports have suggested that Vice President Mike Pence's chief of staff, Nick Ayers, will replace Kelly.</p><div source="" class="image-ct inline"><div class="m"><picture><source media="(max-width: 767px)" srcset="https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/1470/828/gen-kelly.jpg?ve=1&amp;tl=1 2x" /><source media="(min-width: 767px)" srcset="https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/1862/1048/gen-kelly.jpg?ve=1&amp;tl=1 2x" /><img src="https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/640/320/gen-kelly.jpg?ve=1&amp;tl=1" alt="White House Chief of Staff John Kelly takes questions from the media while addressing the daily briefing at the White House in Washington, U.S., October 12, 2017.

But, frankly, she is not -- she’ll never be put in the United Nations, let me put it that way. ... She’s not too diplomatic, but she’s talented."</p><p>Taking stock of the administration's progress after two years, amid some past and apparently pending roster changes, Trump gave himself high marks -- literally.</p><p>"I think I’m doing a great job.  We have the best economy we’ve ever had," the president said.
