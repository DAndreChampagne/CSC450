If evangelical leaders can convince faithful Christians that Donald Trump is the vessel through which God’s goals will be achieved, then there is virtually no limit to the actions that can be excused in its pursuit.</p><p name="5310" id="5310" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">At the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Weekly Standard</em>, Erick Erickson offered this same takeaway in his review of <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">The Faith of Donald J. Trump</em>:</p><blockquote name="71a4" id="71a4" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">Brody and Lamb’s book exposes how the leaders of the evangelical movement, long treated as outcasts from mainstream culture because of the charlatans in their midst, now enjoy an utterly transactional relationship with Donald Trump, each using the other for an end they believe justifies the means.</blockquote><p name="3077" id="3077" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Ends have been a main focus of the modern evangelical movement for some time, perhaps even before Trump appeared as the natural extension of that philosophy—a man who consistently vocalizes his support of Christian priorities even as he defiles Christian doctrine along the way.</p><p name="13c8" id="13c8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">While there may be scattered discussions among evangelicals about the morality of the means through which the ends are met, more often than not there is a sense that relativism is a perfectly acceptable substitute when balancing an immoral cost against a moral outcome.</p><p name="a170" id="a170" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The quintessential example of this mentality is the “lesser evil” argument embraced by many Christians who found Trump to be immoral but voted for him anyway in 2016.</p><p name="285e" id="285e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Moral relativism is used in the service of these all-important ends. Too many false dilemmas and “lesser evil” choices can weigh on the morale of any population, and American evangelicals are no different. So, in an effort to keep the flocks from feeling like they’d sold their souls down the drain of moral relativism, American evangelical leaders in the Trump era have taken it upon themselves to spin bad things as good things and temper the uncertainties of followers by providing poorly constructed biblical rationalizations.</p><p name="02cc" id="02cc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Take, for example, Liberty University president Jerry Falwell Jr. citing scripture on CNN to propose that <a href="https://www.redstate.com/aglanon/2016/10/13/jerry-falwell-jr.-disgrace-liberty-university-resign/" data-href="https://www.redstate.com/aglanon/2016/10/13/jerry-falwell-jr.-disgrace-liberty-university-resign/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Trump’s character is of no significant importance to a Christian</a>, or the narrative that Donald Trump is comparable to the pagan king, Cyrus, a pragmatic <a href="https://www.vox.com/identities/2018/3/5/16796892/trump-cyrus-christian-right-bible-cbn-evangelical-propaganda" data-href="https://www.vox.com/identities/2018/3/5/16796892/trump-cyrus-christian-right-bible-cbn-evangelical-propaganda" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">vessel</a> that God will use for His purposes.</p><p name="34b8" id="34b8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><span class="markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other" name="anon_2dc5bb6ca2dd" data-creator-ids="anon">Between relativism and rationalization, American evangelicals have designed an impenetrable fortress of self-delusion, one that allows open-eyed embrace of hypocrisy without the cumbersome shackles of moral absolutism.</span></p><p name="3188" id="3188" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">The Faith of Donald J.

Making this case will go a long way toward resting fears about relativism and immorality. Once people believe Trump is “God’s guy in the White House,” everything becomes in the service of God’s larger purposes.</p><p name="33ed" id="33ed" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The authors provide moments where they speak on President Trump’s behalf, as a way of saying “what he really meant,” which is often in direct defiance of what he actually said.</p><p name="c503" id="c503" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For example, when they refer to an infamous Trump moment from 2015. While talking to interviewer and pollster Frank Luntz, Trump answers the question of whether he has ever sought forgiveness for his sins:</p><blockquote name="03f9" id="03f9" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">I am not sure I have. I just go and try to do a better job from there. I don’t think so. I think, if I do something wrong, I think I just try to make it right. I don’t bring God into that picture. I don’t.</blockquote><p name="21e5" id="21e5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">The authors, rather than taking a moment to address the underlying problem of professing a Christian faith that excludes the foundational premise of repentance, choose instead to spin, saying, “Ironically, if the truth of the matter is that Trump has never asked God for forgiveness, then if Trump had lied and said ‘yes’ — he could have avoided criticism. That is, lying about his practice of confession would have kept him out of trouble with the piety-inspectors.”</p><p name="a3d4" id="a3d4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When faced with a look inside Trump’s mind and finding things less than desirable, the equivocation boiled down to, “Hey, at least he didn’t lie!”</p><p name="eef7" id="eef7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What a betrayal of their own commitment to the tenets of Christianity. Certainly, they’re rationalizing, but it’s much worse than just that.</p><p name="cde2" id="cde2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">They are arguing that people who believe in the most basic premise of Christianity, the only way to achieve salvation and spend eternity in heaven, the literal function of the Christian faith in which one asks for forgiveness in order to be saved, are pharasiac distractions of “piety inspectors.”</p><p name="e52d" id="e52d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The authors propose that Trump’s revealing comments are the trivial and legalistic criticisms of picky jerks who should be mocked. Further, it’s “ironic” they would care about this minor infraction in light of the fact that lying, a similarly trivial infraction, would have shielded him from criticism.</p><p name="e966" id="e966" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This reasoning is designed to put the onus of the lie on these “piety inspectors,” as if it’s their fault Trump would have to lie about asking for forgiveness rather than his own fault for having not asked.</p><p name="2aa0" id="2aa0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s a hunt for small victories amid a forest of massive defeats in the quest to design Trump’s character as something other than what it appears to be.</p><p name="0766" id="0766" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But further analysis of Trump’s comments that day reveal the real problem of his biblical worldview, at least if it’s important that one accept the evangelical premise that he is God’s Christian vessel.</p><p name="7389" id="7389" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In an attempt to further drive the point they are hoping to craft, the authors quote more of Trump’s controversial comments, in which he replied to Luntz’s request for clarification on his relationship with God:</p><blockquote name="dd09" id="dd09" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">I think God helped me…God helped me by giving me a certain brain, whether that’s a good thing or a bad thing…I went through phenomenal school, the Wharton School of Finance, which is said to be the greatest business school in the world. I did really well there. I was a great student. So, I mean, I was born with a certain intellect that is good for this.</blockquote><p name="1d1a" id="1d1a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">The implications here are painfully obvious. Trump is looking inward, not upward, when trying to answer the question of where he draws his strength. He is laying out quite well, despite a few passing words about the brain God gifted him with, that it is upon that gift, not upon God’s direction, that he will rely.</p><p name="04e0" id="04e0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The authors took a different view, one that a generous critic would say was merely missing the point and an observant critic would identify as deception. “Trump attributed his intellectual and financial success in life to God’s gifting,” they noted. Then they offered a pious explanation for it, saying, “Such attribution is a common religious practice — thanksgiving.”</p><p name="bac2" id="bac2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Their summary, for many who will read the book and treat it more like gospel than the Gospels, is really all that’s needed. Whatever Trump said, however he said it, whatever truths we might use our brains to discern, can all be discarded in favor of the gift of an evangelical voter with a clear conscience and a neatly tied biblical bow on top. Rationalizations certified by evangelical leaders who increasingly find themselves in positions of power they might not be too keen on losing for something as trivial as biblical consistency.</p><p name="76ad" id="76ad" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Most Christian evangelicals would claim that God’s will and the making of His kingdom on earth is of utmost importance. But in the Trump era, it seems clear that this is true even and all the way up to the point of total abdication of biblical obedience. So long as these “greater purposes” are the goal.</p><p name="1c72" id="1c72" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The importance of abortion, or gay marriage, or any other number of religiously motivated policy positions must supersede other “small” matters, such as whether or not the person leading the free world is a lying, adulterous charlatan who seeks no forgiveness or, it seems, guidance from the very God his acolytes claim he’s sworn his service to.</p><p name="2485" id="2485" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Evangelical leaders are pushing, through this book and elsewhere, the narrative of Trump as a faithful instrument of God. They do this to keep voters who might have issues with his actions and behaviors from feeling as though they are violating their religious convictions in their continuing support of everything he does.</p><p name="63f9" id="63f9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">They accept apologies he never gives. They talk about the importance of redemption he never sought. And they cite his agenda as the overriding will of God. Because in the end, it’s about the ends. The ends being the full realization of God’s agenda, which evangelical leaders are intent on proving is identical to Trump’s agenda, regardless of what means are deployed to achieve them.</p><p name="1552" id="1552" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And it feels good to them. It’s easy. The ideology of doing whatever you want with no consequence is being embraced by evangelical leaders in the modern era. It’s created a movement that has no qualms with being cruel, with finding ambiguity in moral questions that used to require conviction. And despite this, they walk around most days apparently thinking God is eminently pleased because they are participating in His works and fulfilling His purposes.</p><p name="a936" id="a936" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">The Faith of Donald J. Trump</em> is simply a marketing ploy. A sales effort. Evangelical leaders working overtime to find a way to give Trump a blanket pass so they can end the exhausting effort of reacting to each individual situation that pops up.</p><p name="1c14" id="1c14" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The American evangelical movement is at a crossroads. Having long since abandoned the notion that there are expectations of conduct and morality within the means to an end, they choose instead to forgo any pretense that God’s designs should be trusted over their own. Instead, they have found other places to apply their faith.</p><p name="e140" id="e140" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">They take great comfort in the notion of a bright future through Donald Trump’s “divine” agenda. They enjoy a clear conscience through the guidance of evangelical luminaries. Unburdened of the need to seek out godly leadership, they find a new and satisfying joy in seeking out worldly men who make them feel powerful. And by this joyous and tranquil arrangement, they tell themselves they’ve made God proud. That belief is a testament to their faith in their own efforts.</p><p name="c9a3" id="c9a3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">In other words, faith in themselves.</p></div></div></section></div></main></div><section class="u-maxWidth700 u-paddingHorizontal20 u-marginAuto"><div class="u-md-show u-marginTop60 u-xs-marginTop25"><div

The real question is why evangelical leaders insist on spinning every Trump misstep into an example of divine guidance. Why are they so intent on supporting the “Trump as a Christian leader” narrative?\x3c/p\x3e\x3cp name=\"d205\" id=\"d205\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\"\x3eThe answer is simple: ends.\x3c/p\x3e\x3c/div\x3e\x3c/div\x3e\x3c/section\x3e\x3csection name=\"2d86\" class=\"section section--body\"\x3e\x3cdiv class=\"section-divider\"\x3e\x3chr class=\"section-divider\"\x3e\x3c/div\x3e\x3cdiv class=\"section-content\"\x3e\x3cdiv class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\"\x3e\x3cp name=\"8bf7\" id=\"8bf7\" class=\"graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf--leading\"\x3e\x3cspan class=\"graf-dropCap\"\x3eW\x3c/span\x3ehat matters most, above all other considerations, to these evangelical leaders is the goal, or the ends — not the means one might undertake to achieve those ends. If evangelical leaders can convince faithful Christians that Donald Trump is the vessel through which God’s goals will be achieved, then there is virtually no limit to the actions that can be excused in its pursuit.\x3c/p\x3e\x3cp name=\"5310\" id=\"5310\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"\x3eAt the \x3cem class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\"\x3eWeekly Standard\x3c/em\x3e, Erick Erickson offered this same takeaway in his review of \x3cem class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\"\x3eThe Faith of Donald J. Trump\x3c/em\x3e:\x3c/p\x3e\x3cblockquote name=\"71a4\" id=\"71a4\" class=\"graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p\"\x3eBrody and Lamb’s book exposes how the leaders of the evangelical movement, long treated as outcasts from mainstream culture because of the charlatans in their midst, now enjoy an utterly transactional relationship with Donald Trump, each using the other for an end they believe justifies the means.\x3c/blockquote\x3e\x3cp name=\"3077\" id=\"3077\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote\"\x3eEnds have been a main focus of the modern evangelical movement for some time, perhaps even before Trump appeared as the natural extension of that philosophy—a man who consistently vocalizes his support of Christian priorities even as he defiles Christian doctrine along the way.\x3c/p\x3e\x3cp name=\"13c8\" id=\"13c8\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"\x3eWhile there may be scattered discussions among evangelicals about the morality of the means through which the ends are met, more often than not there is a sense that relativism is a perfectly acceptable substitute when balancing an immoral cost against a moral outcome.\x3c/p\x3e\x3cp name=\"a170\" id=\"a170\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"\x3eThe quintessential example of this mentality is the “lesser evil” argument embraced by many Christians who found Trump to be immoral but voted for him anyway in 2016.\x3c/p\x3e\x3cp name=\"285e\" id=\"285e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"\x3eMoral relativism is used in the service of these all-important ends. Too many false dilemmas and “lesser evil” choices can weigh on the morale of any population, and American evangelicals are no different. So, in an effort to keep the flocks from feeling like they’d sold their souls down the drain of moral relativism, American evangelical leaders in the Trump era have taken it upon themselves to spin bad things as good things and temper the uncertainties of followers by providing poorly constructed biblical rationalizations.\x3c/p\x3e\x3cp name=\"02cc\" id=\"02cc\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"\x3eTake, for example, Liberty University president Jerry Falwell Jr. citing scripture on CNN to propose that \x3ca href=\"https://www.redstate.com/aglanon/2016/10/13/jerry-falwell-jr.-disgrace-liberty-university-resign/\" data-href=\"https://www.redstate.com/aglanon/2016/10/13/jerry-falwell-jr.-disgrace-liberty-university-resign/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"\x3eTrump’s character is of no significant importance to a Christian\x3c/a\x3e, or the narrative that Donald Trump is comparable to the pagan king, Cyrus, a pragmatic \x3ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/identities/2018/3/5/16796892/trump-cyrus-christian-right-bible-cbn-evangelical-propaganda\" data-href=\"https://www.vox.com/identities/2018/3/5/16796892/trump-cyrus-christian-right-bible-cbn-evangelical-propaganda\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"\x3evessel\x3c/a\x3e that God will use for His purposes.\x3c/p\x3e\x3cp name=\"34b8\" id=\"34b8\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"\x3eBetween relativism and rationalization, American evangelicals have designed an impenetrable fortress of self-delusion, one that allows open-eyed embrace of hypocrisy without the cumbersome shackles of moral absolutism.\x3c/p\x3e\x3cp name=\"3188\" id=\"3188\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\"\x3e\x3cem class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\"\x3eThe Faith of Donald J.

Making this case will go a long way toward resting fears about relativism and immorality. Once people believe Trump is “God’s guy in the White House,” everything becomes in the service of God’s larger purposes.\x3c/p\x3e\x3cp name=\"33ed\" id=\"33ed\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"\x3eThe authors provide moments where they speak on President Trump’s behalf, as a way of saying “what he really meant,” which is often in direct defiance of what he actually said.\x3c/p\x3e\x3cp name=\"c503\" id=\"c503\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"\x3eFor example, when they refer to an infamous Trump moment from 2015. While talking to interviewer and pollster Frank Luntz, Trump answers the question of whether he has ever sought forgiveness for his sins:\x3c/p\x3e\x3cblockquote name=\"03f9\" id=\"03f9\" class=\"graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p\"\x3eI am not sure I have. I just go and try to do a better job from there. I don’t think so. I think, if I do something wrong, I think I just try to make it right. I don’t bring God into that picture. I don’t.\x3c/blockquote\x3e\x3cp name=\"21e5\" id=\"21e5\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote\"\x3eThe authors, rather than taking a moment to address the underlying problem of professing a Christian faith that excludes the foundational premise of repentance, choose instead to spin, saying, “Ironically, if the truth of the matter is that Trump has never asked God for forgiveness, then if Trump had lied and said ‘yes’ — he could have avoided criticism. That is, lying about his practice of confession would have kept him out of trouble with the piety-inspectors.”\x3c/p\x3e\x3cp name=\"a3d4\" id=\"a3d4\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"\x3eWhen faced with a look inside Trump’s mind and finding things less than desirable, the equivocation boiled down to, “Hey, at least he didn’t lie!”\x3c/p\x3e\x3cp name=\"eef7\" id=\"eef7\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"\x3eWhat a betrayal of their own commitment to the tenets of Christianity. Certainly, they’re rationalizing, but it’s much worse than just that.\x3c/p\x3e\x3cp name=\"cde2\" id=\"cde2\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"\x3eThey are arguing that people who believe in the most basic premise of Christianity, the only way to achieve salvation and spend eternity in heaven, the literal function of the Christian faith in which one asks for forgiveness in order to be saved, are pharasiac distractions of “piety inspectors.”\x3c/p\x3e\x3cp name=\"e52d\" id=\"e52d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"\x3eThe authors propose that Trump’s revealing comments are the trivial and legalistic criticisms of picky jerks who should be mocked. Further, it’s “ironic” they would care about this minor infraction in light of the fact that lying, a similarly trivial infraction, would have shielded him from criticism.\x3c/p\x3e\x3cp name=\"e966\" id=\"e966\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"\x3eThis reasoning is designed to put the onus of the lie on these “piety inspectors,” as if it’s their fault Trump would have to lie about asking for forgiveness rather than his own fault for having not asked.\x3c/p\x3e\x3cp name=\"2aa0\" id=\"2aa0\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"\x3eIt’s a hunt for small victories amid a forest of massive defeats in the quest to design Trump’s character as something other than what it appears to be.\x3c/p\x3e\x3cp name=\"0766\" id=\"0766\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"\x3eBut further analysis of Trump’s comments that day reveal the real problem of his biblical worldview, at least if it’s important that one accept the evangelical premise that he is God’s Christian vessel.\x3c/p\x3e\x3cp name=\"7389\" id=\"7389\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"\x3eIn an attempt to further drive the point they are hoping to craft, the authors quote more of Trump’s controversial comments, in which he replied to Luntz’s request for clarification on his relationship with God:\x3c/p\x3e\x3cblockquote name=\"dd09\" id=\"dd09\" class=\"graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p\"\x3eI think God helped me…God helped me by giving me a certain brain, whether that’s a good thing or a bad thing…I went through phenomenal school, the Wharton School of Finance, which is said to be the greatest business school in the world. I did really well there. I was a great student. So, I mean, I was born with a certain intellect that is good for this.\x3c/blockquote\x3e\x3cp name=\"1d1a\" id=\"1d1a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote\"\x3eThe implications here are painfully obvious. Trump is looking inward, not upward, when trying to answer the question of where he draws his strength. He is laying out quite well, despite a few passing words about the brain God gifted him with, that it is upon that gift, not upon God’s direction, that he will rely.\x3c/p\x3e\x3cp name=\"04e0\" id=\"04e0\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"\x3eThe authors took a different view, one that a generous critic would say was merely missing the point and an observant critic would identify as deception. “Trump attributed his intellectual and financial success in life to God’s gifting,” they noted. Then they offered a pious explanation for it, saying, “Such attribution is a common religious practice — thanksgiving.”\x3c/p\x3e\x3cp name=\"bac2\" id=\"bac2\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"\x3eTheir summary, for many who will read the book and treat it more like gospel than the Gospels, is really all that’s needed. Whatever Trump said, however he said it, whatever truths we might use our brains to discern, can all be discarded in favor of the gift of an evangelical voter with a clear conscience and a neatly tied biblical bow on top. Rationalizations certified by evangelical leaders who increasingly find themselves in positions of power they might not be too keen on losing for something as trivial as biblical consistency.\x3c/p\x3e\x3cp name=\"76ad\" id=\"76ad\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"\x3eMost Christian evangelicals would claim that God’s will and the making of His kingdom on earth is of utmost importance. But in the Trump era, it seems clear that this is true even and all the way up to the point of total abdication of biblical obedience. So long as these “greater purposes” are the goal.\x3c/p\x3e\x3cp name=\"1c72\" id=\"1c72\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"\x3eThe importance of abortion, or gay marriage, or any other number of religiously motivated policy positions must supersede other “small” matters, such as whether or not the person leading the free world is a lying, adulterous charlatan who seeks no forgiveness or, it seems, guidance from the very God his acolytes claim he’s sworn his service to.\x3c/p\x3e\x3cp name=\"2485\" id=\"2485\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"\x3eEvangelical leaders are pushing, through this book and elsewhere, the narrative of Trump as a faithful instrument of God. They do this to keep voters who might have issues with his actions and behaviors from feeling as though they are violating their religious convictions in their continuing support of everything he does.\x3c/p\x3e\x3cp name=\"63f9\" id=\"63f9\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"\x3eThey accept apologies he never gives. They talk about the importance of redemption he never sought. And they cite his agenda as the overriding will of God. Because in the end, it’s about the ends. The ends being the full realization of God’s agenda, which evangelical leaders are intent on proving is identical to Trump’s agenda, regardless of what means are deployed to achieve them.\x3c/p\x3e\x3cp name=\"1552\" id=\"1552\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"\x3eAnd it feels good to them. It’s easy. The ideology of doing whatever you want with no consequence is being embraced by evangelical leaders in the modern era. It’s created a movement that has no qualms with being cruel, with finding ambiguity in moral questions that used to require conviction. And despite this, they walk around most days apparently thinking God is eminently pleased because they are participating in His works and fulfilling His purposes.\x3c/p\x3e\x3cp name=\"a936\" id=\"a936\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"\x3e\x3cem class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\"\x3eThe Faith of Donald J. Trump\x3c/em\x3e is simply a marketing ploy. A sales effort. Evangelical leaders working overtime to find a way to give Trump a blanket pass so they can end the exhausting effort of reacting to each individual situation that pops up.\x3c/p\x3e\x3cp name=\"1c14\" id=\"1c14\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"\x3eThe American evangelical movement is at a crossroads. Having long since abandoned the notion that there are expectations of conduct and morality within the means to an end, they choose instead to forgo any pretense that God’s designs should be trusted over their own. Instead, they have found other places to apply their faith.\x3c/p\x3e\x3cp name=\"e140\" id=\"e140\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"\x3eThey take great comfort in the notion of a bright future through Donald Trump’s “divine” agenda. They enjoy a clear conscience through the guidance of evangelical luminaries. Unburdened of the need to seek out godly leadership, they find a new and satisfying joy in seeking out worldly men who make them feel powerful. And by this joyous and tranquil arrangement, they tell themselves they’ve made God proud. That belief is a testament to their faith in their own efforts.\x3c/p\x3e\x3cp name=\"c9a3\" id=\"c9a3\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\"\x3eIn other words, faith in themselves.\x3c/p\x3e\x3c/div\x3e\x3c/div\x3e\x3c/section\x3e"},"socialTitle":null,"socialDek":null,"elevateCoverInfo":{"title":{"name":"c5dc","type":3,"text":"The Faith In Donald J.
