SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7"><p>On <span data-page="page_1"></span>Tuesday, the Washington <em class="">Post</em> published an article about the investigative journalist Bob Woodward’s new book, “<a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1501175513/?tag=thneyo0f-20" target="_blank">Fear</a>,” a long and deeply reported appraisal of the frayed and fraught relationships <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/bob-woodwards-new-book-reveals-a-nervous-breakdown-of-trumps-presidency/2018/09/04/b27a389e-ac60-11e8-a8d7-0f63ab8b1370_story.html" target="_blank">within the Trump White House</a>. Among the book’s story lines is the increasingly adversarial dynamic between Donald Trump and his Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, formerly the four-term junior senator from Alabama, where, in the 2016 election, Trump won roughly sixty-three per cent of the vote. Woodward writes in the book that, at one point, Trump said to a White House staff secretary, about the Attorney General, “This guy is mentally retarded. He’s this dumb Southerner. . . . He couldn’t even be a one-person country lawyer down in Alabama.” Later, <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1037173907625832448" target="_blank">Trump tweeted a denial</a>. “The already discredited Woodward book, so many lies and phony sources, has me calling Jeff Sessions ‘mentally retarded’ and ‘a dumb southerner,’ ” he wrote. “I said <em class="small">NEITHER</em>, never used those terms on anyone, including Jeff, and being a southerner is a <em class="small">GREAT</em> thing. He made this up to divide!” In fact, Trump has called various people “retarded,” <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-retarded-history_us_58011198e4b0e8c198a7d5ad" target="_blank">including on the radio</a>. Woodward reports that Trump mocked Sessions’s accent as well.</p><p>Before Trump’s denial, I spoke with Cam Ward, a Republican state senator in Alabama. He was inclined to believe the reporting, he told me by phone, because Woodward’s “not the disgruntled ‘<a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1250158060/?tag=thneyo0f-20" target="_blank">Fire and Fury</a>’ guy.” (Michael Wolff’s best-seller, published in January, has been described as “<a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/fire-and-fury-is-a-book-all-too-worthy-of-the-president">a rehashing of gossip</a>,” as my colleague Masha Gessen put it, earlier this year.) “It’s a bad situation, this god-awful feud,” Ward continued. “The President is obviously wildly popular in Alabama. And Jeff Sessions is well thought of here, too.” Ward offered a mild rebuke as well as a tepid defense of Trump. “I think he does the Presidency disservice when he says this stuff. But I don’t think it’s an ‘all Southerners are stupid’ or ‘mentally retarded’ ” thing, he said. “I think the President is used to ‘smash-mouth’ New York-style politics. He tends to punch down a lot. I don’t agree with it, how the first thing off the top of his head is the weapon he uses that day, or the tweet that day. But I don’t think he was attacking Southerners.”</p><p>I mentioned the “dumb Southerner” line, from the Woodward book, to Ward. He sighed. “I think it’s this ‘That’s-how-we-do-it-in-New-York, we’ll-cut-you-off-at-the-knees’ approach,” he said.</p><p>Alabama’s Republican secretary of state, John Merrill, backed Trump’s Presidential run in 2016. “As far as Southerners being identified as slow or not capable of processing things like individuals from other parts of the country, let me just say that we’ve made a living for a long time on being underestimated,” he told me. He added, of Sessions, “He truly defines character and integrity in public service. He’s not mentally impaired.”</p><p>Merrill hesitated to condemn Trump, however, saying that he needed “more evidence, more information” about what the President said. “I think there are a number of people in our state who have been disappointed in the way that the President has chosen to express himself from time to time,” he told me. “That will probably continue. But the basic values which the President is promoting are Southern at heart—financial responsibility and moral leadership—and they are why our people voted for him. Not because of the way he chooses to express himself, which can be embarrassing.”</p><p>Michael Bullington, a twenty-four-year-old financial analyst in Birmingham, co-hosts the “<a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/unlike-their-elders-alabamas-young-republicans-wrestle-with-the-roy-moore-allegations">Young Alabama</a>” podcast in his spare time. Bullington did not vote for Trump or support the right-wing Senate candidate Roy Moore, but he is “strongly conservative and supportive of Jeff Sessions on most issues,” he said. “I’m pretty livid right now,” he told me, citing not only the Woodward book but also Trump’s recent <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1036681588573130752" target="_blank">anti-Sessions tweets</a> and a <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https://www.politico.com/story/2018/08/29/trump-sessions-firing-senators-white-house-803922" target="_blank"><em class="">Politico</em> story reporting</a> that Trump told aides that Sessions talks like he has “marbles in his mouth.”</p><p>“I’m not very old, but I remember a time when a New Yorker making fun of Southern accents and calling Southerners mentally retarded would have been condemned by a lot of people here,” Bullington said. “I’ve been very disappointed to not see the Party and other leaders in Alabama do the bare minimum to support Sessions.”</p><p>If a tape emerged of Trump mocking Alabamians, how would people there likely respond? “I think there’d be some anger, but also questions about whether the tapes were actually legitimate, even if Trump said they were,” Bullington said. “If he were to disparage Nick Saban, then we’d have more of an issue,” he added, referring to the coach of the University of Alabama’s football team. Bullington told me he plans to discuss the issue on the next episode of his podcast.</p><p>Elizabeth BeShears, a Republican political-communications consultant in Birmingham, also regards it as unfortunate “that more Alabamians aren’t up in arms” about Trump’s comments. “I think there are many Alabamians, particularly politicians, who find what the President said to be distasteful, but are worried they will lose voter support if they stand against him,” she explained.</p><p>Not surprisingly, Doug Jones, the Democratic junior senator from Alabama, who defeated Moore in an election upset, last fall, offered a more blunt appraisal than most of the Republicans I spoke to. “I haven’t read the Woodward book yet,” he told me. “But I read the alleged quotes in the news. If they are true, the President is not only mocking and insulting his own<span data-page="page_final"></span> hand-picked Attorney General, he is mocking and insulting all of those millions of voters and people who continue to support him throughout the South. It’s élitism, not recognizing the value of the hardworking people of the South.” He went on, “I get tired of people like Donald Trump making fun of people in the South, perceiving us as second-class citizens.” Did he think Alabamians would react? He wasn’t sure. “There will be a segment who will respond,” Jones said. “There will be a segment who won’t believe it,” he added.</p><p>“Everybody sees why he wants Sessions gone. It came pretty clear yesterday <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1036681588573130752" target="_blank">in that remarkable tweet</a> undermining the Justice Department’s indictments of two sitting congressmen,” Jones continued. “He should have the guts enough to go ahead and fire Sessions if he doesn’t want him rather than being a bully and just whining about him. Be the Commander-in-Chief. Just do it and let the consequences begin.”</p><p>I asked Cam Ward, the state senator, if he thought firing Sessions would damage Trump’s support in Alabama. He thought not. “It’s pretty well accepted here that Trump, at some point, will get rid of Sessions,” he said. “But, through every controversy of the last two years, you never see the President’s numbers dip below the mid-sixties in Alabama. They haven’t moved the needle. If him going after Jeff Sessions the way he has already doesn’t move it, I don’t think firing him is gonna move the needle any further. The battle lines are pretty hardened. The middle ground is as small as it’s been in the modern Presidency.”</p><p>Later, I spoke to a prominent attorney in Montgomery, who calls himself an Independent, and who asked to remain anonymous. He told me that, in his view, Trump was “destroying the position of the Presidency” and that he was “not surprised by anything he says.” He added, “But the fact that he would demean an area of the country that one hundred per cent supports him . . . ” Then he trailed off. After a pause, he added, “Maybe everything Trump says about Alabama is true, because only a dumbass would vote for that idiot.”</p></div></div></div></div><footer

Trump White House"],". Among the book’s story lines is the increasingly adversarial dynamic between Donald Trump and his Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, formerly the four-term junior senator from Alabama, where, in the 2016 election, Trump won roughly sixty-three per cent of the vote. Woodward writes in the book that, at one point, Trump said to a White House staff secretary, about the Attorney General, “This guy is mentally retarded. He’s this dumb Southerner. . . . He couldn’t even be a one-person country lawyer down in Alabama.” Later, ",["a",{"href":"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1037173907625832448"},"Trump tweeted a denial"],". “The already discredited Woodward book, so many lies and phony sources, has me calling Jeff Sessions ‘mentally retarded’ and ‘a dumb southerner,’ ” he wrote. “I said ",["em",{"class":"small"},"NEITHER"],", never used those terms on anyone, including Jeff, and being a southerner is a ",["em",{"class":"small"},"GREAT"]," thing. He made this up to divide!” In fact, Trump has called various people “retarded,” ",["a",{"href":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-retarded-history_us_58011198e4b0e8c198a7d5ad"},"including on the radio"],". Woodward reports that Trump mocked Sessions’s accent as well."],["p","Before Trump’s denial, I spoke with Cam Ward, a Republican state senator in Alabama. He was inclined to believe the reporting, he told me by phone, because Woodward’s “not the disgruntled ‘",["a",{"href":"https://www.amazon.com/Fire-Fury-Inside-Trump-White/dp/1250158060/"},"Fire and Fury"],"’ guy.” (Michael Wolff’s best-seller, published in January, has been described as “",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/fire-and-fury-is-a-book-all-too-worthy-of-the-president"},"a rehashing of gossip"],",” as my colleague Masha Gessen put it, earlier this year.) “It’s a bad situation, this god-awful feud,” Ward continued. “The President is obviously wildly popular in Alabama. And Jeff Sessions is well thought of here, too.” Ward offered a mild rebuke as well as a tepid defense of Trump. “I think he does the Presidency disservice when he says this stuff. But I don’t think it’s an ‘all Southerners are stupid’ or ‘mentally retarded’ ” thing, he said. “I think the President is used to ‘smash-mouth’ New York-style politics. He tends to punch down a lot. I don’t agree with it, how the first thing off the top of his head is the weapon he uses that day, or the tweet that day. But I don’t think he was attacking Southerners.”"],["p","I mentioned the “dumb Southerner” line, from the Woodward book, to Ward. He sighed. “I think it’s this ‘That’s-how-we-do-it-in-New-York, we’ll-cut-you-off-at-the-knees’ approach,” he said."],["p","Alabama’s Republican secretary of state, John Merrill, backed Trump’s Presidential run in 2016. “As far as Southerners being identified as slow or not capable of processing things like individuals from other parts of the country, let me just say that we’ve made a living for a long time on being underestimated,” he told me. He added, of Sessions, “He truly defines character and integrity in public service. He’s not mentally impaired.”"],["p","Merrill hesitated to condemn Trump, however, saying that he needed “more evidence, more information” about what the President said. “I think there are a number of people in our state who have been disappointed in the way that the President has chosen to express himself from time to time,” he told me. “That will probably continue. But the basic values which the President is promoting are Southern at heart—financial responsibility and moral leadership—and they are why our people voted for him. Not because of the way he chooses to express himself, which can be embarrassing.”"],["p","Michael Bullington, a twenty-four-year-old financial analyst in Birmingham, co-hosts the “",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/unlike-their-elders-alabamas-young-republicans-wrestle-with-the-roy-moore-allegations"},"Young Alabama"],"” podcast in his spare time. Bullington did not vote for Trump or support the right-wing Senate candidate Roy Moore, but he is “strongly conservative and supportive of Jeff Sessions on most issues,” he said. “I’m pretty livid right now,” he told me, citing not only the Woodward book but also Trump’s recent ",["a",{"href":"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1036681588573130752"},"anti-Sessions tweets"]," and a ",["a",{"href":"https://www.politico.com/story/2018/08/29/trump-sessions-firing-senators-white-house-803922"},["em","Politico"]," story reporting"]," that Trump told aides that Sessions talks like he has “marbles in his mouth.”"],["p","“I’m not very old, but I remember a time when a New Yorker making fun of Southern accents and calling Southerners mentally retarded would have been condemned by a lot of people here,” Bullington said. “I’ve been very disappointed to not see the Party and other leaders in Alabama do the bare minimum to support Sessions.”"],["p","If a tape emerged of Trump mocking Alabamians, how would people there likely respond? “I think there’d be some anger, but also questions about whether the tapes were actually legitimate, even if Trump said they were,” Bullington said. “If he were to disparage Nick Saban, then we’d have more of an issue,” he added, referring to the coach of the University of Alabama’s football team. Bullington told me he plans to discuss the issue on the next episode of his podcast."],["p","Elizabeth BeShears, a Republican political-communications consultant in Birmingham, also regards it as unfortunate “that more Alabamians aren’t up in arms” about Trump’s comments. “I think there are many Alabamians, particularly politicians, who find what the President said to be distasteful, but are worried they will lose voter support if they stand against him,” she explained."],["p","Not surprisingly, Doug Jones, the Democratic junior senator from Alabama, who defeated Moore in an election upset, last fall, offered a more blunt appraisal than most of the Republicans I spoke to. “I haven’t read the Woodward book yet,” he told me. “But I read the alleged quotes in the news.

He wasn’t sure. “There will be a segment who will respond,” Jones said. “There will be a segment who won’t believe it,” he added."],["p","“Everybody sees why he wants Sessions gone.

Be the Commander-in-Chief. Just do it and let the consequences begin.”"],["p","I asked Cam Ward, the state senator, if he thought firing Sessions would damage Trump’s support in Alabama. He thought not. “It’s pretty well accepted here that Trump, at some point, will get rid of Sessions,” he said. “But, through every controversy of the last two years, you never see the President’s numbers dip below the mid-sixties in Alabama. They haven’t moved the needle. If him going after Jeff Sessions the way he has already doesn’t move it, I don’t think firing him is gonna move the needle any further.

the ouster of its king. King Saud, the son and first successor of the country’s founder, was forced out peacefully, in 1964, but his departure was six years in the making. King Faisal, who orchestrated the coup against Saud and succeeded him, was assassinated eleven years later, by a nephew. (Three months later, the nephew was beheaded, by a sword with a golden hilt, as a crowd shouted, “God is great.”) Both upheavals linger in the public memory as questions grow about Saudi Arabia’s current de-facto leader and crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, and his role in the murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Several of the henchmen involved in the murder of the Washington *Post* columnist, which took place at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul, were part of Prince Mohammed’s inner circle or security entourage. M.B.S., as the prince is widely known, has been widely implicated, directly or indirectly.\n\n“Yes, I think he did it,” Senator Bob Corker, the chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, [told](https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2018/10/21/sotu-corker-prince.cnn) CNN. On Tuesday, the President of Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, [charged](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/23/turkish-president-erdogan-rejects-saudi-account-of-khashoggi-killing) that some of the “highest ranking” Saudi officials were involved in the killing. “From the person who gave the order to the person who carried it out, they must all be brought to account,” he told the Turkish parliament. Finally, on Thursday—after two weeks of claiming that the Saudi journalist had exited the consulate alive, and then claiming that he had been accidentally murdered in a “rogue” rendition—Saudi officials reversed course yet again and conceded that “new information” gleaned in a joint investigation with Turkey had confirmed that the murder was, indeed, [premeditated](https://apnews.com/602e88e1b76148c48dcfe4838d9be33b).\n\nThe crown prince appears to be aware of the dangers ahead. He also already appears to be gaming his political rehabilitation, both at home and in the eyes of the outside world.  His first public comment on Khashoggi’s murder was, notably, at the “Davos in the Desert” conference designed to lure foreign investment to pay for his own ambitious Vision 2030 economic plan. With his red-checkered kaffiyeh draped over the front of his pristine white robe, M.B.S. finally [broke](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/24/mohammed-bin-salman-jamal-khashoggi-heinous-crime-saudi-turkey) his three-week silence on the murder of his fellow-Saudi. “The incident was really painful to all Saudis. I believe it is painful to every human in the world,” he said, on Wednesday. “It is a heinous crime that cannot be justified.”\n\nPrince Mohammed’s first comment—and the recent arrest of eighteen Saudis—will clearly not be enough, especially for the international community. On Thursday, the European Union’s parliament [voted](https://apnews.com/d4a7236a3267489892a368ee864f36e0), 325–1, to ban all arms exports “of surveillance systems and other dual-use items that may be used in Saudi Arabia for the purposes of repression.” In Washington, both Republicans and Democrats have advocated limits on arms exports, particularly for use in Saudi Arabia’s three-year war in Yemen.\n\nThere are at least four potential scenarios for how all this will play out for M.B.S., Saudis and Middle East experts contend. The first centers on the royal family’s response. In 1975, after King Faisal’s murder, the then governor of Riyadh, Prince Salman, was reportedly the only royal in a crowd of some ten thousand to witness the execution of the young assassin. (The assassin’s head was displayed on a stake for a time, before being removed for burial, the *Times* reported.) That same Salman is now king; M.B.S. is his son and political heir.\n\nOne scenario is that the international furor eventually settles down and M.B.S. remains the crown prince and retains his hold on the country’s future.  “People who think there’s going to be any change in the succession are wrong,” Prince Turki al-Faisal, a former chief of Saudi intelligence and a former ambassador to the United States, told David Ignatius of the Washington Post this week. “The more [foreign] criticism there is of the crown prince, the more popular he is in the kingdom.”\n\nBefore the murder, M.B.S. seemed widely popular among young Saudis, because he provided release valves in the kingdom’s rigid social mores—opening movie theatres, allowing women to drive, and reining in the morality police. Opposition often played out over human rights or on sectarian grounds,  fuelled by the isolation and repression of the minority Shiite population. Judging public sentiment in  Saudi Arabia is difficult, however, as it is one of the most impenetrable societies on earth and has no independent public polling.\n\nA second scenario is that M.B.S. is replaced as crown prince. There is precedent for this. Since King Salman came to power, three years ago, he has twice [dismissed](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2015/05/27/breaking-the-saudi-rules-of-succession/?utm_term=.5f36afe5e9eb) a crown prince: Prince Muqrin, one of the last of the  generation sired by the kingdom’s founder, was pushed aside in 2015. Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, the former Minister of the Interior and a close U.S. ally on counterterrorism, was forced out in 2017—to make space for M.B.S. Nayef is still under virtual house arrest.\n\n “A lot of senior princes are whispering in the king’s ear that it’s time for M.B.S. to be moved aside and another son of the king or another member of the family to be put in his place,” Bruce Riedel, a former senior U.S. intelligence official, said at a Wilson Center event on Wednesday. “They have to be aware that M.B.S. is the greater danger to the kingdom today.”\n\nThe crown prince’s ouster is perhaps possible, but it’s not yet probable. It would take a decision by the king to turn against his favorite son. And, as Senator Corker [told](https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/21/politics/bob-corker-cnntv/index.html) CNN, King Salman “is not particularly coherent.” The king is now in his early eighties and has purportedly been ailing in the last few years, possibly with a mild form of dementia. That is one reason that M.B.S. has been able to swiftly consolidate all the wings of political, military, and economic power under his own office.\n\nMore basically, there is no sign yet of a coalition within the royal family to block M.B.S.’s ascension to the throne. Gregory Gause, a Saudi expert at the Bush School of Government, at Texas A. & M., told me, “I haven’t seen any public evidence—as in the past incidents—of an intra-family dispute. Although many don’t like him, they don’t have the ability to get together to stop him.”\n \nThe House of Saud today is also vastly larger than it was during its  first two painful transitions of power, decades ago. The royal family is [sprawling](https://www.economist.com/special-report/2006/01/05/all-in-the-family). Ibn Saud, the founder, had more than forty sons and even more daughters. Saud, his son, had more than a hundred children. The family now has thousands of members. Partly because of its size—and the imminent transition from the first generation of brothers to some of their sons—the late King Abdullah announced, in 2006, the creation of an Allegiance Council. It currently includes only thirty-five senior princes. The king alone used to name his crown prince. Now the council is empowered to vote on his candidate. Few on the Allegiance Council opted to vote against M.B.S. when he was appointed, last year. Royals have grumbled to me in the past over M.B.S.’s increasingly repressive ways, but few have been willing  to challenge him as he has consolidated power. Few Saudis dare to publicly challenge the powerful crown prince for fear of retribution. “Most of the public who are not happy with M.B.S. are happy with the pressure on him from outside the country,” a Saudi academic, who asked not to be identified because he has family in the kingdom, told me. “They don’t want to become a victim by going public and facing a crackdown.” Chaos in other parts of the Middle East—in Syria, Libya, Yemen, and Iraq—has also been a reality check on the public thinking. “Someone from outside the system could make it collapse, and they don’t want to see instability like elsewhere in the region,” he told me.\n\nThe third scenario is that M.B.S.’s hold on power is weakened, possibly by having other princes appointed to take over some of his current positions. “We might see his wings clipped,” Gause told me. “Perhaps the appointment of some senior people in new positions—Khalid al Faisal as foreign minister?—to act as guard rails on foreign policy, so he cannot act unilaterally. But things are very fluid.” he Saudi academic added, “M.B.S. will have to bow down, to compromise. He can’t rule like he did a month ago.”\n\nThe crown prince may also not be able to ascend to the throne as fast as he hoped. For months, there has been speculation in the region and in Washington that M.B.S. was jockeying for his father to step aside as king and become regent, citing ill health. M.B.S. would then ascend to the throne while his father was still alive. That would make it harder for any opposition within the royal family to emerge, as it might after the king’s death. “Khashoggi’s death makes that scenario less likely,” Gause said. “M.B.S. needs the cover of his father until this dies down.”\n\nThe fourth scenario is what happened to Faisal—someone targets him physically. It seems, by far, the least likely. Whatever happens to M.B.S. will have sweeping consequences. It could shape the future of the desert kingdom for many decades; he is only thirty-three. It will influence the immediate Gulf region, notably Saudi Arabia’s open-ended war in Yemen on its southern border (launched in 2015) and its blockade of Qatar to the east (started in 2017). Each was a brainchild of the crown prince. His fate will play out in the wider Middle East, too, given Prince Mohammed’s heavy-handed foreign policy in Lebanon, Egypt, and Syria. And it will have a rippling impact worldwide, given that Saudi Arabia is the world’s largest oil exporter and the largest reservoir for future oil supplies. Dozens of countries depend on it for energy and fuel. The impact of Jamal Khashoggi’s murder is only beginning to be felt.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"sections":[{"id":"590a02541c7a8e33fb390be1","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"590a02541c7a8e33fb390be1","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News Desk","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news-desk"},{"id":"5904126172dadf5d0a508800","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news"},{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"}],"name":"News Desk","parent":[{"id":"5904126172dadf5d0a508800","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"},"slug":"news-desk"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"web","contributors":[{"id":"5910a8a54e65be2f29d55eb2","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Robin Wright has been a contributing writer to *The New Yorker* since\n1988.

Shortly after 11 *A.M.*{: .small} on October 2nd, a heavyset man dressed in tennis shoes and a blue-and-white plaid shirt, untucked, walked through the canopied entrance to the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. He has been identified by Turkish officials as Mustafa al-Madani, reportedly a Saudi intelligence agent who flew to Turkey that day as part of a fifteen-man hit squad. At 1:14 *P.M.*{: .small}, Khashoggi entered through the same door, which is decorated with the Saudi national symbol—crossed swords and a palm tree. Khashoggi, a dissident Saudi journalist who [wrote](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/khashoggis-final-wordsfor-other-journalists-like-him) for the Washington *Post*, was wearing a dark sports coat, a light-gray shirt, and dress shoes.\n\n \n\nThe shoes were a key giveaway. At 2:52 *P.M*{: .small}., Madani walked out of the consulate’s back door in Khashoggi’s clothes—except for the shoes. He was still in his sneakers. The two men were of roughly the same height, weight, and age—in their late fifties. But they apparently did not have the same shoe size. According to Turkish surveillance video, broadcast by CNN on Monday, Madani and an accomplice—who had a hoodie over his head and was carrying a white plastic bag—took a taxi to a crowded mosque and went into a public men’s toilet. When they came out, Madani was back in his blue-and-white shirt, which presumably had been in the white plastic bag, and was still wearing his tennis shoes. Surveillance cameras then caught them tossing the bag, which likely contained Khashoggi’s clothing at that point, into a dumpster. With that, the last trace of the Saudi dissident disappeared.\n\n \n\n“Khashoggi’s clothes were probably still warm when Madani put them on,” a senior Turkish official [told CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/22/middleeast/saudi-operative-jamal-khashoggi-clothes/index.html). In another surveillance photograph leaked by the Turks, Madani and his companion—no longer wearing a hoodie—are shown smiling together in front of an elevator. The evidence in the Khashoggi murder increasingly points to premeditation by the Saudi government. The idea of a rogue operation gone wrong—which is the kingdom’s explanation—no longer seems credible. Before Madani left the consulate in Khashoggi’s clothes, he put on a false beard that resembled Khashoggi’s facial hair. Like the bone saw that the team allegedly carried, a fake beard is a prop that they would presumably have needed to bring with them, especially given how fast the switch played out. “We are facing a situation that has been monstrously planned and later tried to be covered up,” Ömer Çelik, a spokesman for Turkey’s ruling Justice and Development Party, told Reuters. “It is a complicated murder.”\n\n \n\nOn Sunday, the Saudi foreign minister, Adel al-Jubeir, a former Ambassador to Washington, described Khashoggi’s death as a “tremendous mistake,” which was not commissioned by the government. “The individuals who did this did this outside the scope of their authority,” he told Fox News. “What compounded the mistake was the attempt to try to cover up. That is unacceptable in any government.” He claimed that the kingdom’s leaders still do not know where the journalist’s body is. “We are determined to uncover every stone,” he said. “We are determined to find out all the facts. And we are determined to punish those who are responsible for this murder.” But the evidence increasingly points to the inner circle around the powerful crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman—and perhaps to the prince himself. Records show that Madani travelled with the crown prince on foreign trips, including to the United States in the spring, the *Post* reported.\n\n \n\nThe use of body doubles is not unique to Saudi Arabia. Saddam Hussein, the former President of Iraq, had multiple look-alikes and used them regularly for public appearances. One of the statues of Saddam that was torn down after his ouster, in 2003, turned out to be based on one of his approved impersonators. In the Soviet Union, Joseph Stalin had at least four body doubles. Felix Dadaev, a dancer and a juggler, claimed that he and others impersonated the former Soviet leader during rallies, motorcades, and media appearances—including once for a decoy flight to the famous summit in Yalta with President Franklin Roosevelt and the British Prime Minister Winston Churchill—when Stalin believed that he was in danger. Using a body double for Khashoggi might have been an attempt to lend credence to Saudi Arabia’s first (of several) versions of events: that Khashoggi had exited through the back not long after he arrived. The kingdom never released its own video, however, possibly because Turkey got out so far ahead in claiming that the *Post* columnist had been murdered.\n\n \n\nThe Turkish President, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, is expected to lay out details of Khashoggi’s murder in a speech to parliament on Tuesday—“in full nakedness,” he [said](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/21/world/middleeast/erdogan-khashoggi-turkey-saudi-arabia.html) on Sunday. But the scope of evidence suggesting premeditation or an official coverup is widening. On Monday, a Turkish television station also aired video that it claimed showed three men burning documents in a drum behind the Saudi consulate on October 3rd, a day after Khashoggi’s murder. The Turkish outlet described the documents as “evidence.” Turkish authorities also cordoned off a parking structure where an abandoned Saudi car, with diplomatic plates, was found. It, too, was believed to have links to the Khashoggi saga.\n\n \n\nPresident Trump has also signalled concern about the Saudi explanation for Khashoggi’s murder. On Monday, he told reporters, “I am not satisfied with what I’ve heard.” Over the weekend, he told the Washington *Post*, “Obviously there’s been deception and there’s been lies,” and added, “Their stories are all over the place.” Yet the Administration is sticking by the crown prince. “He's seen as a person who can keep things under check,” Trump told the *Post*. “I mean that in a positive way.” The crown prince, he said, “truly loves his country.”\n\n \n\nThe Treasury Secretary, Steve Mnuchin, met with the crown prince on Monday, underscoring the Administration’s willingness to maintain ties with him. Just last week, Mnuchin backed out of the kingdom’s Davos in the Desert gathering—an economic conference of major financial, technology, and government figures designed to lure foreign investment for the prince’s Vision 2030 plan to modernize Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia’s foreign ministry tweeted a picture of the two men. “#CrownPrince meets with the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury and stresses the importance of Saudi-US strategic partnership, where it holds an important role in the future in line with the Kingdom’s #Vision2030,” it said. On a previous stop in Jerusalem, Mnuchin told reporters that the U.S. and Saudi Arabia share strategic interests, notably in containing Iran, confronting extremism, and coördinating on energy issues. “We will continue in that relationship, while we also simultaneously want to get to the bottom of what the facts are about the Khashoggi situation, which is obviously a terrible situation,” Mnuchin said after talks with the Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. The C.I.A. director, Gina Haspel, was dispatched to Turkey to coördinate on the Khashoggi investigation, Reuters reported late on Monday.\n\n \n\nAlso on Monday, nearly three weeks after the murder, Jared Kushner, the President’s son-in-law and chief interlocutor with Saudi Arabia, spoke for the first time about the Khashoggi case. (The U.S. still does not have an Ambassador in Riyadh.) “Right now, as an Administration, we’re more in the fact-finding phase,” he said at an event sponsored by CNN, in New York. But, he added, “We have our eyes wide open.” Last year, Kushner convinced the President to make Saudi Arabia the first stop on his first foreign mission. He also helped orchestrate the crown prince’s sweeping U.S. tour in the spring. Kushner has worked closely with the prince on Trump’s attempt to broker a final Arab-Israeli peace plan. At the event in New York, Kushner was asked what he had advised Prince Mohammed after Khashoggi’s disappeared. “Be transparent. The world is watching,” Kushner said. “This is a very serious accusation.”\n\n","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"sections":[{"id":"590a02541c7a8e33fb390be1","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News Desk","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news-desk"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5910a8a54e65be2f29d55eb2","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Robin Wright has been a contributing writer to *The New Yorker* since\n1988.

It confirmed Khashoggi’s death—a “painful outcome,” it said—and blithely reversed the kingdom’s repeated and insistent lies that he had safely walked out of the consulate in Istanbul shortly after he entered it, on October 2nd. Sixteen days later, the Saudis said that they need another month to investigate his death, which would conveniently time the release of their findings to the aftermath of a pivotal midterm election in the United States. Incredibly, the Saudi Foreign Ministry, which is in charge of the consulate in Turkey, offered no explanation of where Khashoggi’s body might be, even though its employees were among the last to see the dissident Washington *Post* columnist alive.\n\nThe most suspect development, though, is that the crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman—the autocratic, thirty-three-year-old royal most widely implicated, directly or indirectly, in Khashoggi’s disappearance—will play a role in the review. The three branches of government involved in the problem—the Foreign Ministry, the Interior Ministry, and the Saudi security services—are all under his control anyway.\n\nThere is no Robert Mueller in the kingdom. The judiciary is an arm of one of the world’s most repressive governments; the crown prince is the de-facto ruler, because of his father’s age and ailments. Saudi courts, the prosecution, and state security are, the State Department’s human-rights [report](https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/277507.pdf) from 2017 noted, “required to coordinate their decisions with executive authorities, with the king and crown prince as arbiters.” The report also stated that Saudi Arabia doesn’t adhere to a formal written penal code listing criminal offenses or the penalties for them. The legal system is a rigid interpretation of Islamic Sharia. In many ways, an investigation involving the crown prince—who is popularly known as M.B.S., after his initials—is like asking Tony Soprano to help figure out who was behind a mob hit. “It is absurd to entrust the investigation of Khashoggi’s murder to those most likely to have ordered it,” Summer Lopez, the senior director of *PEN*{: .small} America’s Free Expression Programs, which has championed the case, said in a statement. Moments after the government statement, the kingdom also announced the creation of a committee to “[restructure](https://twitter.com/KSAmofaEN?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor)” Saudi intelligence. It will also be headed by M.B.S.\n\nThe Saudi arrest of eighteen officials related to Khashoggi’s death was, President Trump said on Friday night, “a great first step.” He told reporters that what happened to the Saudi journalist was “unacceptable,” but added that “Saudi Arabia has been a great ally.” Asked if he found the kingdom’s explanation credible, he replied, “I do, I do.”\n\nThe President had told reporters just two days earlier that he expected a full report on the Khashoggi case by week’s end. Instead, he got a stall for more time—a delay as the kingdom struggles to create a face-saving narrative. On Friday, Trump said that he wants to talk with the crown prince before he takes any further action. He has already rejected limiting U.S. arms sales to the ruling royal family, the House of Saud, which has been engrossed in an open-ended war in neighboring Yemen, initiated in 2015 by the crown prince in his first role as defense minister. The campaign, which relies heavily on U.S. military equipment and ammunition, has produced the world’s gravest humanitarian crisis. Some [thirteen million people](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/middle-east/saudi-led-war-in-yemen-risks-plunging-half-population-into-famine-1.3668323) in Yemen—roughly half of the population—now face famine, with millions of [children](https://www.unicef.org/press-releases/yemen-millions-children-could-soon-be-without-food-or-water-economic-crisis-deepens) without food and water, and there are more than 1.2 million suspected [cases](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-yemen-security-cholera/yemen-cholera-outbreak-accelerates-to-10000-cases-per-week-who-idUSKCN1MC23J) of cholera.\n\nThe White House seems increasingly isolated, however, in its willingness to wait longer for the Saudi report. The Khashoggi affair may be the one issue on which there is sweeping bipartisan agreement in Washington and among foreign-policy analysts. The crown prince, who has consolidated the five major sources of political, military, and economic power since his appointment, in June, 2017, is “on the precipice of being another Saddam Hussein,” the former U.S. Ambassador to Saudi Arabia, Robert Jordan, said on CNN on Friday evening. “The Saudi government has been lying to the world about Khashoggi from the start,” Nicholas Burns, the former U.S. Ambassador to *NATO*{: .small}, the world’s largest military alliance, [tweeted](https://twitter.com/RNicholasBurns/status/1053413256411385857). “Now rounding up the usual suspects.”\n\nThe reaction in Congress, which must approve U.S. arms sales, was also one of disbelief. Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, who is the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, charged that the Saudi story “continues to change with each passing day, so we should not assume their latest story holds water.” He called for the United States to carry out its own independent investigation under the Global Magnitsky Act, which can be invoked in cases of suspected human-rights abuses. Senator Tim Kaine, Democrat of Virginia, who was Hillary Clinton’s running-mate in 2016, called the Saudi statement “insulting,” adding that, “since the Trump Administration won’t stand up against atrocity, Congress must.” \n\n“To say that I am skeptical of the new Saudi narrative about Mr. Khashoggi is an understatement,” Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, tweeted shortly after the news broke. Earlier this week, Graham said that he would not deal with the kingdom as long as the crown prince was the de-facto power. Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, who is a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, [tweeted](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/10/19/jamal-khashoggi-congress-says-saudi-arabias-explanation-not-credible/1702034002/) that the “explanations continue to defy credibility & common sense. No way should the world wait thirty days for a Saudi whitewash or cover up.” He called for an international investigation to identify all responsible for Khashoggi’s murder—“not just Crown Prince’s fall guys.”\n\nThe Saudi version of Khashoggi’s fate—explained in the clumsy translation tweeted early Saturday—is that unnamed “suspects” travelled to Istanbul following unspecified “indications” about returning Khashoggi to Saudi Arabia. Since going into exile, about the time that M.B.S. was appointed crown prince, Khashoggi had become the most widely published critic of the crown prince though his *Post* column. As his pieces became more critical, he confided in friends that he feared the crown prince wanted him “out of the picture,” as he told me. He had visited the Saudi consulate only to get papers so that he could prove that he was divorced and could marry his Turkish fiancée.\n\nAccording to the Saudi tweet, the meeting “did not go as required and escalated negatively, which led to a fight between them and the citizen Jamal Khashoggi, which aggregated [sic] the situation and led to his death,” it said. “May God rest his soul.” The unnamed perpetrators, it added, then tried to “cover it up.” No kidding.\n\nKhashoggi would have turned sixty last Saturday. He was a tallish man, but a bit paunchy and hardly a match for the fifteen men—basically a hit squad—whom Turkish officials claim were involved in his death. The idea that he would have gotten into a fight so vicious that it would end his life is beyond improbable. And then there’s the question about the intention of the senior Saudi forensic pathologist and the bone saw brought into the consulate, purportedly used to cut off Khashoggi’s fingers and then to dismember the rest of his body.\n\nRepresentative Adam Schiff, of California, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said that if Khashoggi had a fight in the consulate, he was only “fighting for his life with people sent to capture or kill him.” Karen Attiah, Khashoggi’s editor at the *Post*, called the Saudi explanation “utter bullshit.” She tweeted, “What sort of equal ‘fight’ would he have had against fifteen other men? And who brings a bone saw to a ‘discussion’?! The stupidity of the Saudi explanation is mind boggling.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”\n\nThe monarchy also dismissed five senior officials, most of them closely associated with the crown prince. For several days, reports have suggested that the fall guy in the Khashoggi affair may be General Ahmed al-Asiri, one of the main architects of the Saudi war in Yemen. Asiri was later named to the deputy intelligence post. Saud al-Qahtani, a top adviser to the royal court, particularly the crown prince, was also fired. He had [reportedly](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/world/wp/2018/10/19/saudi-government-acknowledges-journalist-jamal-khashaoggi-died-while-in-that-countrys-consulate-in-istanbul/?utm_term=.a3667eecb002) reached out to Khashoggi earlier this year in order to convince him to voluntarily return to the country, possibly so that the journalist could then be detained. In a curious tweet, after the Saudi announcement onSaturday, Qahtani wrote to his 1.3 million followers that he “will forever be a loyal servant to this country and this nation shall always stand tall”—and that he was indebted to the crown prince and to the king. \n\nThe longer the details of Khashoggi’s death remain hidden, the higher the costs to the credibility—and future—of the kingdom, especially its increasingly authoritarian young ruler.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"sections":[{"id":"5907f159ebe912338a3717d7","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Daily Comment","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"daily-comment"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5910a8a54e65be2f29d55eb2","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Robin Wright has been a contributing writer to *The New Yorker* since\n1988.

Shortly after 11 *A.M.*{: .small} on October 2nd, a heavyset man dressed in tennis shoes and a blue-and-white plaid shirt, untucked, walked through the canopied entrance to the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. He has been identified by Turkish officials as Mustafa al-Madani, reportedly a Saudi intelligence agent who flew to Turkey that day as part of a fifteen-man hit squad. At 1:14 *P.M.*{: .small}, Khashoggi entered through the same door, which is decorated with the Saudi national symbol—crossed swords and a palm tree. Khashoggi, a dissident Saudi journalist who [wrote](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/khashoggis-final-wordsfor-other-journalists-like-him) for the Washington *Post*, was wearing a dark sports coat, a light-gray shirt, and dress shoes.\n\n \n\nThe shoes were a key giveaway. At 2:52 *P.M*{: .small}., Madani walked out of the consulate’s back door in Khashoggi’s clothes—except for the shoes. He was still in his sneakers. The two men were of roughly the same height, weight, and age—in their late fifties. But they apparently did not have the same shoe size. According to Turkish surveillance video, broadcast by CNN on Monday, Madani and an accomplice—who had a hoodie over his head and was carrying a white plastic bag—took a taxi to a crowded mosque and went into a public men’s toilet. When they came out, Madani was back in his blue-and-white shirt, which presumably had been in the white plastic bag, and was still wearing his tennis shoes. Surveillance cameras then caught them tossing the bag, which likely contained Khashoggi’s clothing at that point, into a dumpster. With that, the last trace of the Saudi dissident disappeared.\n\n \n\n“Khashoggi’s clothes were probably still warm when Madani put them on,” a senior Turkish official [told CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/22/middleeast/saudi-operative-jamal-khashoggi-clothes/index.html). In another surveillance photograph leaked by the Turks, Madani and his companion—no longer wearing a hoodie—are shown smiling together in front of an elevator. The evidence in the Khashoggi murder increasingly points to premeditation by the Saudi government. The idea of a rogue operation gone wrong—which is the kingdom’s explanation—no longer seems credible. Before Madani left the consulate in Khashoggi’s clothes, he put on a false beard that resembled Khashoggi’s facial hair. Like the bone saw that the team allegedly carried, a fake beard is a prop that they would presumably have needed to bring with them, especially given how fast the switch played out. “We are facing a situation that has been monstrously planned and later tried to be covered up,” Ömer Çelik, a spokesman for Turkey’s ruling Justice and Development Party, told Reuters. “It is a complicated murder.”\n\n \n\nOn Sunday, the Saudi foreign minister, Adel al-Jubeir, a former Ambassador to Washington, described Khashoggi’s death as a “tremendous mistake,” which was not commissioned by the government. “The individuals who did this did this outside the scope of their authority,” he told Fox News. “What compounded the mistake was the attempt to try to cover up. That is unacceptable in any government.” He claimed that the kingdom’s leaders still do not know where the journalist’s body is. “We are determined to uncover every stone,” he said. “We are determined to find out all the facts. And we are determined to punish those who are responsible for this murder.” But the evidence increasingly points to the inner circle around the powerful crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman—and perhaps to the prince himself. Records show that Madani travelled with the crown prince on foreign trips, including to the United States in the spring, the *Post* reported.\n\n \n\nThe use of body doubles is not unique to Saudi Arabia. Saddam Hussein, the former President of Iraq, had multiple look-alikes and used them regularly for public appearances. One of the statues of Saddam that was torn down after his ouster, in 2003, turned out to be based on one of his approved impersonators. In the Soviet Union, Joseph Stalin had at least four body doubles. Felix Dadaev, a dancer and a juggler, claimed that he and others impersonated the former Soviet leader during rallies, motorcades, and media appearances—including once for a decoy flight to the famous summit in Yalta with President Franklin Roosevelt and the British Prime Minister Winston Churchill—when Stalin believed that he was in danger. Using a body double for Khashoggi might have been an attempt to lend credence to Saudi Arabia’s first (of several) versions of events: that Khashoggi had exited through the back not long after he arrived. The kingdom never released its own video, however, possibly because Turkey got out so far ahead in claiming that the *Post* columnist had been murdered.\n\n \n\nThe Turkish President, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, is expected to lay out details of Khashoggi’s murder in a speech to parliament on Tuesday—“in full nakedness,” he [said](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/21/world/middleeast/erdogan-khashoggi-turkey-saudi-arabia.html) on Sunday. But the scope of evidence suggesting premeditation or an official coverup is widening. On Monday, a Turkish television station also aired video that it claimed showed three men burning documents in a drum behind the Saudi consulate on October 3rd, a day after Khashoggi’s murder. The Turkish outlet described the documents as “evidence.” Turkish authorities also cordoned off a parking structure where an abandoned Saudi car, with diplomatic plates, was found. It, too, was believed to have links to the Khashoggi saga.\n\n \n\nPresident Trump has also signalled concern about the Saudi explanation for Khashoggi’s murder. On Monday, he told reporters, “I am not satisfied with what I’ve heard.” Over the weekend, he told the Washington *Post*, “Obviously there’s been deception and there’s been lies,” and added, “Their stories are all over the place.” Yet the Administration is sticking by the crown prince. “He's seen as a person who can keep things under check,” Trump told the *Post*. “I mean that in a positive way.” The crown prince, he said, “truly loves his country.”\n\n \n\nThe Treasury Secretary, Steve Mnuchin, met with the crown prince on Monday, underscoring the Administration’s willingness to maintain ties with him. Just last week, Mnuchin backed out of the kingdom’s Davos in the Desert gathering—an economic conference of major financial, technology, and government figures designed to lure foreign investment for the prince’s Vision 2030 plan to modernize Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia’s foreign ministry tweeted a picture of the two men. “#CrownPrince meets with the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury and stresses the importance of Saudi-US strategic partnership, where it holds an important role in the future in line with the Kingdom’s #Vision2030,” it said. On a previous stop in Jerusalem, Mnuchin told reporters that the U.S. and Saudi Arabia share strategic interests, notably in containing Iran, confronting extremism, and coördinating on energy issues. “We will continue in that relationship, while we also simultaneously want to get to the bottom of what the facts are about the Khashoggi situation, which is obviously a terrible situation,” Mnuchin said after talks with the Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. The C.I.A. director, Gina Haspel, was dispatched to Turkey to coördinate on the Khashoggi investigation, Reuters reported late on Monday.\n\n \n\nAlso on Monday, nearly three weeks after the murder, Jared Kushner, the President’s son-in-law and chief interlocutor with Saudi Arabia, spoke for the first time about the Khashoggi case. (The U.S. still does not have an Ambassador in Riyadh.) “Right now, as an Administration, we’re more in the fact-finding phase,” he said at an event sponsored by CNN, in New York. But, he added, “We have our eyes wide open.” Last year, Kushner convinced the President to make Saudi Arabia the first stop on his first foreign mission. He also helped orchestrate the crown prince’s sweeping U.S. tour in the spring. Kushner has worked closely with the prince on Trump’s attempt to broker a final Arab-Israeli peace plan. At the event in New York, Kushner was asked what he had advised Prince Mohammed after Khashoggi’s disappeared. “Be transparent. The world is watching,” Kushner said. “This is a very serious accusation.”\n\n","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"sections":[{"id":"590a02541c7a8e33fb390be1","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"590a02541c7a8e33fb390be1","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News Desk","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news-desk"},{"id":"5904126172dadf5d0a508800","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news"},{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"}],"name":"News Desk","parent":[{"id":"5904126172dadf5d0a508800","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"},"slug":"news-desk"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"web","contributors":[{"id":"5910a8a54e65be2f29d55eb2","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Robin Wright has been a contributing writer to *The New Yorker* since\n1988.

[Jamal Khashoggi](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/jamal-khashoggi) disappeared, the Washington *Post* received a final column left behind with his assistant when he went off to Turkey to get married. It was, in seven hundred words, poignant and personal and epically appropriate, considering his fate. “The Arab world was ripe with hope during the spring of 2011\\. Journalists, academics and the general population were brimming with expectations of a bright and free Arab society within their respective countries,” he [opined](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/global-opinions/jamal-khashoggi-what-the-arab-world-needs-most-is-free-expression/2018/10/17/adfc8c44-d21d-11e8-8c22-fa2ef74bd6d6_story.html?noredirect=on&utm_term=.167d8ec8d487). “They expected to be emancipated from the hegemony of their governments and the consistent interventions and censorship of information.” Instead, rulers grew ever more repressive after the short-lived [Arab Spring](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/arab-spring).\n\nToday, hundreds of millions of people across the Middle East “are unable to adequately address, much less publicly discuss, matters that affect the region and their day-to-day lives,” Khashoggi wrote. They are either “uninformed or misinformed” by draconian censorship and fake state narratives. As the headline of his last published words asserted, “What the Arab world needs most is free expression.”\n\nIn his death, Khashoggi, a Saudi journalist and former government supporter who became a vocal and fearless critic of the current [Saudi crown prince](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/04/09/a-saudi-princes-quest-to-remake-the-middle-east), has galvanized global attention far more than he was able to do during his life. The horrific details of his murder and dismemberment have had an effect he would never have imagined—putting into serious question the fate of a Saudi leader, the state of U.S.-Saudi relations, American foreign-policy goals in the world’s most volatile region, and even policies that have kept dictators in power. The repercussions are only beginning.\n\nBut Khashoggi was hardly a lone voice decrying political repression in the Middle East, as he acknowledged in his final *Post* column. Saudi Arabia may be the most cruel and ruthless government in the region, but it uses tactics embraced by dictators, sheikhs, and Presidents across twenty-two countries.\n\nIn 2014, Egypt’s military-dominated government seized all print copies of the newspaper *Al-Masry Al-Youm*, whose name means “The Egyptian Today.” *Al-Masry Al-Youm* is that rare private newspaper in the Arab world where young reporters once dared to question government policies in hard-hitting editorials and groundbreaking journalism. “The Egyptian government’s seizure of the entire print run of a newspaper, *al-Masry al Youm*, did not enrage or provoke a reaction from colleagues. These actions no longer carry the consequence of a backlash from the international community,” Khashoggi wrote. “Instead, these actions may trigger condemnation quickly followed by silence.” \n\nThe world, particularly the West, is partly culpable for looking the other way, he wrote. It is a tragic irony that the world is paying attention to Khashoggi’s death, yet still not making an issue of a sweeping problem that could determine the future of a region of twenty-two countries and four hundred million people. On Thursday, the U.S. Treasury Secretary, Steve Mnuchin, announced that he would not attend the Saudi investment conference known as “Davos in the Desert,” which is pivotal to the crown prince’s plans to modernize the kingdom’s oil-reliant economy. The British trade minister, the French and Dutch finance ministers, and the president of the International Monetary Fund also backed out after Khashoggi’s disappearance. But no foreign government is addressing the broader political practices in any other country, or any other case, in the region.\n\nIn his column, Khashoggi drew attention to imprisoned colleagues who receive no coverage. “My dear friend, the prominent Saudi writer Saleh al-Shehi, wrote one of the most famous columns ever published in the Saudi press,” Khashoggi noted. “He unfortunately is now serving an unwarranted five-year prison sentence for supposed comments contrary to the Saudi establishment.” Shehi, who had more than a million [followers](https://www.ft.com/content/3c597510-0cee-11e8-839d-41ca06376bf2) on Twitter, was [charged](https://www.alaraby.co.uk/english/news/2018/2/8/saudi-columnist-jailed-for-insulting-the-royal-court) with “insulting the royal court” for his statements about widespread government corruption in his columns for the newspaper *Al Watan* and on a local television program.\n\nMichael Abramowitz, the president of Freedom House and a former national editor at the Washington *Post*, told me that Khashoggi rightly identified the broader stakes. “Khashoggi’s final column accurately pinpointed the appalling lack of political rights and civil liberties in much of the Arab world, especially the right to freely express oneself,” he said. Khashoggi began his last piece by citing Freedom House’s 2018 report—and the fact that only one Arab country, Tunisia, is ranked as “free.” Abramowitz told me, “What is especially sad is that, while we are properly focussed on the outrageous actions by the Saudi government to silence one critic, we must also remember that countless other bloggers, journalists, and writers have been jailed, censored, physically threatened, and even murdered—with little notice from the rest of the world. And, in some cases, notably Egypt, conditions have deteriorated.”\n\nIn the Gulf states, Human Rights Watch [chronicled](https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/11/01/arab-gulf-states-attempts-silence-140-characters) a hundred and forty cases—a number chosen based on the original character limit on Twitter, though there are actually many, many more—where governments have silenced peaceful critics simply for their online activism. Among the most famous is Raif Badawi, a young Saudi blogger who ran a Web site called the Saudi Liberal Network that dared to discuss the country’s rigid Islamic restrictions on culture. One post mocked the prohibition against observing Valentine’s Day, which, like all non-Muslim holidays, is banned in Saudi Arabia. In 2014, he was sentenced to ten years in prison, a thousand lashes, and a fine that exceeded a quarter million dollars. (I wrote about his case [in 2015](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/saudi-whipping).)\n\nBadawi’s sister Samar—who received the 2012 International Women of Courage Award at a White House ceremony hosted by Michelle Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton—was [arrested](https://globalnews.ca/news/4367523/raif-badawis-sister-arrested-in-saudi-arabia-amnesty-international/) in July. When the Canadian Foreign Minister, Chrystia Freeland, tweeted her concern about the Badawi siblings, in August, the kingdom responded by expelling the Canadian Ambassador, recalling its envoy, freezing all new trade and investment, suspending flights by the state airline to Toronto, and ordering thousands of Saudi students to leave Canada. (I wrote about the episode [that month](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/saudi-arabias-crown-prince-picks-a-very-strange-fight-with-canada).)\n\nIn Bahrain, Nabeel Rajab, one of the Arab world’s most prominent human-rights advocates, is languishing in jail after being sentenced to five years for tweeting about torture in the tiny sheikhdom and criticizing Saudi Arabia’s war in Yemen. In the United Arab Emirates, Ahmed Mansoor, who ran a Web site focussed on reforms, was sentenced to ten years for social-media comments calling for reform.\n\n“The Arab people are desperate for real news and information, and Arab governments are desperately trying to make sure they never get that,” Sarah Leah Whitson, the executive director of Human Rights Watch’s Middle East and North Africa division, told me. “Uncensored communication on social media promised journalists and writers in the Middle East the greatest hope to freely exchange ideas and information, but it’s also why Arab governments, so terrified of the voices of their own citizens, rushed to pass laws criminalizing online communications and jailing writers and activists for mere tweets.”\n\nThe wider world bought into the Saudi narrative that [Mohammed bin Salman](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/mohammed-bin-salman), the crown prince and de-facto ruler, was intent on opening up the kingdom. Perhaps tellingly, it is the free press elsewhere in the world that first asked questions about Khashoggi’s October 2nd disappearance, in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, where he had gone to get papers so he could marry. “The world should take note that it is the free press, not the Saudi government or the White House, that has doggedly searched for the truth about what happened to Mr. Khashoggi,” the Democratic senator Patrick Leahy, of Vermont, said in a [statement](https://www.leahy.senate.gov/press/101718khashoggistatement). “It reminds us, once again, that a free press is an essential check against tyranny, dishonesty, and impunity.”\n","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"sections":[{"id":"590a02541c7a8e33fb390be1","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News Desk","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news-desk"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5910a8a54e65be2f29d55eb2","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Robin Wright has been a contributing writer to *The New Yorker* since\n1988.

It confirmed Khashoggi’s death—a “painful outcome,” it said—and blithely reversed the kingdom’s repeated and insistent lies that he had safely walked out of the consulate in Istanbul shortly after he entered it, on October 2nd. Sixteen days later, the Saudis said that they need another month to investigate his death, which would conveniently time the release of their findings to the aftermath of a pivotal midterm election in the United States. Incredibly, the Saudi Foreign Ministry, which is in charge of the consulate in Turkey, offered no explanation of where Khashoggi’s body might be, even though its employees were among the last to see the dissident Washington *Post* columnist alive.\n\nThe most suspect development, though, is that the crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman—the autocratic, thirty-three-year-old royal most widely implicated, directly or indirectly, in Khashoggi’s disappearance—will play a role in the review. The three branches of government involved in the problem—the Foreign Ministry, the Interior Ministry, and the Saudi security services—are all under his control anyway.\n\nThere is no Robert Mueller in the kingdom. The judiciary is an arm of one of the world’s most repressive governments; the crown prince is the de-facto ruler, because of his father’s age and ailments. Saudi courts, the prosecution, and state security are, the State Department’s human-rights [report](https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/277507.pdf) from 2017 noted, “required to coordinate their decisions with executive authorities, with the king and crown prince as arbiters.” The report also stated that Saudi Arabia doesn’t adhere to a formal written penal code listing criminal offenses or the penalties for them. The legal system is a rigid interpretation of Islamic Sharia. In many ways, an investigation involving the crown prince—who is popularly known as M.B.S., after his initials—is like asking Tony Soprano to help figure out who was behind a mob hit. “It is absurd to entrust the investigation of Khashoggi’s murder to those most likely to have ordered it,” Summer Lopez, the senior director of *PEN*{: .small} America’s Free Expression Programs, which has championed the case, said in a statement. Moments after the government statement, the kingdom also announced the creation of a committee to “[restructure](https://twitter.com/KSAmofaEN?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor)” Saudi intelligence. It will also be headed by M.B.S.\n\nThe Saudi arrest of eighteen officials related to Khashoggi’s death was, President Trump said on Friday night, “a great first step.” He told reporters that what happened to the Saudi journalist was “unacceptable,” but added that “Saudi Arabia has been a great ally.” Asked if he found the kingdom’s explanation credible, he replied, “I do, I do.”\n\nThe President had told reporters just two days earlier that he expected a full report on the Khashoggi case by week’s end. Instead, he got a stall for more time—a delay as the kingdom struggles to create a face-saving narrative. On Friday, Trump said that he wants to talk with the crown prince before he takes any further action. He has already rejected limiting U.S. arms sales to the ruling royal family, the House of Saud, which has been engrossed in an open-ended war in neighboring Yemen, initiated in 2015 by the crown prince in his first role as defense minister. The campaign, which relies heavily on U.S. military equipment and ammunition, has produced the world’s gravest humanitarian crisis. Some [thirteen million people](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/middle-east/saudi-led-war-in-yemen-risks-plunging-half-population-into-famine-1.3668323) in Yemen—roughly half of the population—now face famine, with millions of [children](https://www.unicef.org/press-releases/yemen-millions-children-could-soon-be-without-food-or-water-economic-crisis-deepens) without food and water, and there are more than 1.2 million suspected [cases](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-yemen-security-cholera/yemen-cholera-outbreak-accelerates-to-10000-cases-per-week-who-idUSKCN1MC23J) of cholera.\n\nThe White House seems increasingly isolated, however, in its willingness to wait longer for the Saudi report. The Khashoggi affair may be the one issue on which there is sweeping bipartisan agreement in Washington and among foreign-policy analysts. The crown prince, who has consolidated the five major sources of political, military, and economic power since his appointment, in June, 2017, is “on the precipice of being another Saddam Hussein,” the former U.S. Ambassador to Saudi Arabia, Robert Jordan, said on CNN on Friday evening. “The Saudi government has been lying to the world about Khashoggi from the start,” Nicholas Burns, the former U.S. Ambassador to *NATO*{: .small}, the world’s largest military alliance, [tweeted](https://twitter.com/RNicholasBurns/status/1053413256411385857). “Now rounding up the usual suspects.”\n\nThe reaction in Congress, which must approve U.S. arms sales, was also one of disbelief. Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, who is the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, charged that the Saudi story “continues to change with each passing day, so we should not assume their latest story holds water.” He called for the United States to carry out its own independent investigation under the Global Magnitsky Act, which can be invoked in cases of suspected human-rights abuses. Senator Tim Kaine, Democrat of Virginia, who was Hillary Clinton’s running-mate in 2016, called the Saudi statement “insulting,” adding that, “since the Trump Administration won’t stand up against atrocity, Congress must.” \n\n“To say that I am skeptical of the new Saudi narrative about Mr. Khashoggi is an understatement,” Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, tweeted shortly after the news broke. Earlier this week, Graham said that he would not deal with the kingdom as long as the crown prince was the de-facto power. Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, who is a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, [tweeted](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/10/19/jamal-khashoggi-congress-says-saudi-arabias-explanation-not-credible/1702034002/) that the “explanations continue to defy credibility & common sense. No way should the world wait thirty days for a Saudi whitewash or cover up.” He called for an international investigation to identify all responsible for Khashoggi’s murder—“not just Crown Prince’s fall guys.”\n\nThe Saudi version of Khashoggi’s fate—explained in the clumsy translation tweeted early Saturday—is that unnamed “suspects” travelled to Istanbul following unspecified “indications” about returning Khashoggi to Saudi Arabia. Since going into exile, about the time that M.B.S. was appointed crown prince, Khashoggi had become the most widely published critic of the crown prince though his *Post* column. As his pieces became more critical, he confided in friends that he feared the crown prince wanted him “out of the picture,” as he told me. He had visited the Saudi consulate only to get papers so that he could prove that he was divorced and could marry his Turkish fiancée.\n\nAccording to the Saudi tweet, the meeting “did not go as required and escalated negatively, which led to a fight between them and the citizen Jamal Khashoggi, which aggregated [sic] the situation and led to his death,” it said. “May God rest his soul.” The unnamed perpetrators, it added, then tried to “cover it up.” No kidding.\n\nKhashoggi would have turned sixty last Saturday. He was a tallish man, but a bit paunchy and hardly a match for the fifteen men—basically a hit squad—whom Turkish officials claim were involved in his death. The idea that he would have gotten into a fight so vicious that it would end his life is beyond improbable. And then there’s the question about the intention of the senior Saudi forensic pathologist and the bone saw brought into the consulate, purportedly used to cut off Khashoggi’s fingers and then to dismember the rest of his body.\n\nRepresentative Adam Schiff, of California, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said that if Khashoggi had a fight in the consulate, he was only “fighting for his life with people sent to capture or kill him.” Karen Attiah, Khashoggi’s editor at the *Post*, called the Saudi explanation “utter bullshit.” She tweeted, “What sort of equal ‘fight’ would he have had against fifteen other men? And who brings a bone saw to a ‘discussion’?! The stupidity of the Saudi explanation is mind boggling.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”\n\nThe monarchy also dismissed five senior officials, most of them closely associated with the crown prince. For several days, reports have suggested that the fall guy in the Khashoggi affair may be General Ahmed al-Asiri, one of the main architects of the Saudi war in Yemen. Asiri was later named to the deputy intelligence post. Saud al-Qahtani, a top adviser to the royal court, particularly the crown prince, was also fired. He had [reportedly](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/world/wp/2018/10/19/saudi-government-acknowledges-journalist-jamal-khashaoggi-died-while-in-that-countrys-consulate-in-istanbul/?utm_term=.a3667eecb002) reached out to Khashoggi earlier this year in order to convince him to voluntarily return to the country, possibly so that the journalist could then be detained. In a curious tweet, after the Saudi announcement onSaturday, Qahtani wrote to his 1.3 million followers that he “will forever be a loyal servant to this country and this nation shall always stand tall”—and that he was indebted to the crown prince and to the king. \n\nThe longer the details of Khashoggi’s death remain hidden, the higher the costs to the credibility—and future—of the kingdom, especially its increasingly authoritarian young ruler.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"sections":[{"id":"5907f159ebe912338a3717d7","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Daily Comment","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"daily-comment"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5910a8a54e65be2f29d55eb2","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Robin Wright has been a contributing writer to *The New Yorker* since\n1988.

Of the nine challenges discussed, there was one—“promoting and maintaining an ethical workplace culture”—that was unprecedented in the seventeen years that such reports have been issued. “We have identified instances in which some D.O.I. employees, including senior officials, have engaged in unethical or illegal conduct,” the report said. Violations included sexual harassment (an ongoing problem among National Park Service employees) and “the acceptance of gifts from outside sources; conflicts of interest, including the use of public office for private gain; and the misuse of Government resources.” Kendall concluded that her office was committed to continuing its investigations, a promise she has kept over the past year. She is currently leading at least four investigations into the activities of Secretary Zinke himself, including one concerning his ties to a real-estate deal, in Whitefish, Montana, that is backed by the chairman of Halliburton. \n\nLast Tuesday, [reports](https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/411631-hud-political-appointee-to-replace-interior-department-inspector) [emerged](https://www.outsideonline.com/2355936/zinke-fires-inspector-general) that Zinke had dismissed Kendall, who has held her position for close to a decade, replacing her with a Trump political appointee named Suzanne Israel Tufts, who formerly held a post at the Department of Housing and Urban Development (*HUD*{:.small}). A department spokesman confirmed Tufts’s move to [*The Hill*](https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/411631-hud-political-appointee-to-replace-interior-department-inspector), but the source of the news was a leaked e-mail sent by the *HUD*{:.small} Secretary, Ben Carson, to his staff the previous Friday. “It is with mixed emotions that I announce that Suzanne Israel Tufts, our Assistant Secretary for Administration, has decided to leave *HUD*{:.small} to become the Acting Inspector General at the Department of Interior,” Carson wrote. The subject line of the e-mail was “A Fond Farewell.” \n\nThe Senate confirmed Tufts to her position at *HUD*{:.small} last December, and she reportedly absorbed the duties of the former chief administrative officer who had refused to approve the new furniture that Secretary Carson wanted, noting that the congressional limit for redecorations was five thousand dollars. (Carson reportedly went ahead and ordered a thirty-one-thousand-dollar dining set under Tufts’s purview, but then cancelled the order in March, after it became widely publicized.) Criticism of the staffing change from government watchdogs, members of Congress, and environmental advocates—it “reeks,” “stinks,” it’s “dangerous,” they wrote—was immediate and widespread. Michael Bromwich, the former inspector general for the Department of Justice, [tweeted](https://twitter.com/mrbromwich/status/1052294685207736327), “Changing IGs in the midst of multiple serious investigations of the agency’s head should raise alarm bells everywhere.” Meanwhile, a spokesperson from the inspector general’s office said that Kendall and her staff had not been informed of the move. As far as Kendall knew, she still had the job.\n\nThe news took a strange turn a day and a half later, when Heather Swift, a senior adviser to Zinke, said in a statement that the D.O.I. had not approved the hiring of a political appointee to replace Kendall. “Ms. Tufts is not employed by the Department and no decision was ever made to move her to Interior,” Swift said. She said that Carson, who is a friend of Zinke’s, had “sent out an email that had 100 percent false information in it.” The White House, she added, had referred Tufts to Interior officials for a possible position in the inspector general’s office, but “at the end of the day, she was not offered a job.” The mixup was explained away as a “miscommunication at the staff level,” according to an unnamed *HUD*{:.small} official who spoke to the Washington *Post*.\n\nLater the same day, coincidentally or not, Kendall’s office issued [a report](https://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/documents/national/doi-inspector-general-report-on-secretary-zinkes-alleged-abuse-of-office/3245/) documenting its investigations and conclusions concerning some of Zinke’s alleged abuses of power. Lola Zinke, the Secretary’s wife, had been allowed to ride with the Secretary in government vehicles despite an Interior policy prohibiting the practice among non-governmental employees. (Zinke ultimately reimbursed the department for the taxpayer dollars her rides had cost.) The I.G. found that Zinke had asked his staff to research whether his wife could get a job as an Interior Department volunteer, as a way to make her ride-alongs legitimate and free, according to one ethics official. Zinke “denied that it was an effort to circumvent the requirement to reimburse the D.O.I. for her travel.” The report also documented how the U.S. Park Police had provided a twenty-five-thousand-dollar unarmed security detail to accompany Zinke and his wife on their holiday in Turkey and Greece last summer. (He apparently was concerned about his safety in Istanbul.) Zinke also invited two political contributors, who had hosted a campaign fund-raiser for him in 2014, when he was running for Montana’s lone seat in Congress, on a government-paid trip to California’s Channel Islands National Park. He did not notify D.O.I. lawyers of his financial ties to his two guests.\n\nFor now, Kendall and her staff will continue their investigations of Zinke’s conduct. Her office is still looking at several possible abuses, including the potential conflict of interest between Zinke and the chairman of Halliburton over a Montana real-estate deal. The oil-services company stands to benefit from the kind of Interior Department decisions that Zinke has been making [in abundance](https://www.newyorker.com/science/elements/ryan-zinkes-great-american-fire-sale), including opening public lands for increased oil exploration and loosening regulations around drilling standards. In August, Politico [reported](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/08/02/zinke-interior-making-beer-montana-719358) that the chairman of Halliburton, David Lesar, had backed a development project in Zinke’s hometown of Whitefish, Montana, which included plans to build a microbrewery adjacent to land owned by a Zinke-controlled foundation. Zinke’s wife, the foundation’s head, had submitted plans for a parking lot in the development, and Zinke himself had proposed building a microbrewery in the area multiple times since at least 2012. In response, Zinke told reporters, “Neither my wife or I are involved with the building or operation of any planned microbrewery. Any suggestion to the contrary is absurd.” \n\nIn the meantime, a total of [fifteen investigations](https://www.citizensforethics.org/a-guide-to-the-14-federal-investigations-into-ryan-zinke/) into Zinke’s alleged misconduct have been opened since he took office, including I.G. inquiries that have already been closed, and others from the Office of Special Counsel and the Government Accountability Office. There is Zinke’s role in blocking two Connecticut tribes’ applications to open casinos shortly after meetings with lobbyists from MGM Resorts, which recently opened a two-million-square-foot casino complex in Springfield, Massachusetts. Other I.G. inquiries range from Zinke’s efforts to change the boundary of the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument to deleting any mention of humans’ role in causing climate change from a National Park Service report. Whether Kendall will have enough time to see her investigations to the end is another question. She took the reins in 2009, as the acting I.G., after serving as deputy I.G. for the previous ten years, but has never been put up for Senate confirmation (Obama tried and failed in 2015), meaning her job is still, technically, a temporary one.

The front of each card features the B.L.M. logo (a river winding into green foothills); short descriptions of the Bureau’s “vision,” “mission,” and “values”; and an oil rig. On the flip side is a list of “guiding principles,” accompanied by an image of two cowboys riding across a golden plain. Amber Cargile, a B.L.M. spokeswoman, told me that the new cards are meant to reflect the agency’s “multiple-use mission on working landscapes across the West, which includes grazing, energy, timber, mining, recreation, and many other programs.” Individual employees, she added, can opt to wear or display the cards at their own discretion. But, according to the advocacy group Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility, which obtained photos of the cards and [shared them with the Washington *Post*](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2018/03/15/oil-rigs-and-cowboys-interior-agency-gives-employees-new-cards-to-wear/), supervisors in at least two B.L.M. field offices have been verbally “advising that employees must clip them to their lanyards.” Some workers, speaking to the *Post* anonymously, said that they felt they had no choice but to comply.\n\nSince last March, when Ryan Zinke assumed leadership of the Interior Department, vacating Montana’s lone seat in the U.S. House of Representatives, this sort of ideological conformity has been a top priority. On Wednesday, the department’s Office of Inspector General released a report finding that, between June and October of last year, Zinke reassigned twenty-seven senior officials [without reason or adequate warning](https://www.doioig.gov/reports/reassignment-senior-executives-us-department-interior). Many of them “questioned whether these reassignments were political or punitive,” the report states, “or believed their reassignment may have been related to their prior work assignments, including climate change, energy, or conservation.” (In response, [Deputy Secretary David Bernhardt said](https://www.eenews.net/stories/1060078761) that the department will continue to use “reassignments robustly as a management tool.”) In some B.L.M. field offices, posters depicting conservation landmarks, such as a federally protected red-rock canyon, have been swapped out for ones showing a towering black coal bed and a yellow haul truck. One Interior Department official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, citing fear of reprisal, said that the agency had discontinued its program of making conservation posters publicly available. The new ones are strictly internal—“for employee morale,” the source said, with evident irony.\n\nBarely three weeks after Zinke took office, President Trump issued an executive order aimed at “[promoting energy independence and economic growth](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/presidential-executive-order-promoting-energy-independence-economic-growth/),” in which he directed the Interior Secretary to “suspend, revise, or rescind” any guidelines that imposed “regulatory burdens” on the oil, natural-gas, and mining industries. Zinke, a former Navy *SEAL*{: .small} who raised money for his congressional campaign by raffling off an AR-15 painted with the stars and stripes, seemed keen to carry out the President’s order, but he initially encountered some resistance. In a speech to the National Petroleum Council last September, Zinke claimed that a third of the career civil servants under his command were “[not loyal to the flag](https://apnews.com/570c910d21be41869f76d45a2c55c359),” by which he meant Trump. He compared his department to a group of pirates who capture “a prized ship at sea and only the captain and the first mate row over” to get the job done. The vision cards, it appears, were meant to remind B.L.M. employees that their main responsibility is not to keep the prized ship afloat but to plunder it for all the fossil fuels, ore, and grazing rights it’s worth.\n\nZinke isn’t the first Interior Secretary to see this as the agency’s proper function, but he has been more aggressive than his predecessors at implementing his agenda. So far, he and Trump have eliminated two million acres from the nation’s protected areas, and offered another 11\\.6 million acres of largely wild public lands to oil-and-gas prospectors. (Zinke also proposed raising entrance fees at some national parks by forty dollars or more, arguing that too many people—“[elderly, fourth-graders, veterans, disabled](https://www.nbc26.com/newsy/zinke-defends-proposal-to-raise-national-park-fees)”—get in at a discount or for free. After widespread protest, he [announced](http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/382906-zinke-backs-off-plan-for-big-national-park-fee-increases) this week that his department would raise the fee by five dollars.) The [most substantial wholesale cuts](https://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/after-bears-ears-and-grand-staircase-escalante-where-will-trumps-war-on-public-lands-end) have been in southern Utah, where Trump shrunk Bears Ears National Monument by eighty-five per cent and Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument by half. Both monuments were originally protected by Democratic Presidents—Bears Ears, in 2016, by Barack Obama; Grand Staircase, in 1996, by Bill Clinton—and it isn’t yet clear whether Trump has the constitutional authority to reverse their directives. What is clear, though, is why he did it. According to internal agency documents [obtained by the *Times*](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/02/climate/bears-ears-national-monument.html), the decision was driven by the potential for oil, coal, gas, and uranium exploration within the monuments’ borders. A month before Zinke announced plans to review the status of roughly thirty national monuments, inviting the public to comment, he was in touch with Utah’s congressional delegation about the parts of Bears Ears that could be developed. In the end, the monument’s new boundaries were an almost exact match for what the Utahns wanted. \n\nAt the same time, Zinke has revamped the B.L.M.’s oil-and-gas leasing process to make it more industry-friendly. In January, the agency issued new guidelines scrapping many of the reforms that the Obama Administration had enacted. According to Steve Bloch, the legal director of the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance, those reforms emphasized a “think first, lease later” approach, designed to account for the competing claims of local and national stakeholders—politicians, environmentalists, energy companies, hunters, [tribal groups](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_jDtZfg8eg), and so on. The new process, Bloch told me, is “intended to offer as many parcels as possible on as fast a schedule as possible.” Under Zinke, the land nominated for leasing no longer requires a pre-sale environmental assessment. The Interior Department official said that the B.L.M. “is pushing us to authorize lease sales in a way that doesn’t trigger the same level of public involvement.” The source added, “We’re gonna get our asses handed to us in court.” In Bloch’s estimation, Zinke’s changes return the B.L.M. to the “&nbsp;‘drill here, drill now’ days of the Bush Administration.”\n\nGeorge W. Bush was no friend of the environment, but he could justify his policies, to some extent, on economic grounds. In the early years of his Presidency, the domestic natural-gas supply was sinking and the country was reliant on imported fuel. Bush sought to boost production by auctioning off leases on millions of acres of public land. Since then, the energy sector has changed. Fracking on mostly private lands in the Permian Basin, in Texas, and the Bakken Formation, in North Dakota, has led to an energy surplus. These days, the industry seems to lack serious interest in new oil-and-gas leases on federal lands, which have a “[higher break-even price](http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-oil-gas-lease-public-land-2018-story.html),” according to Kathleen Sgamma, the president of the Western Energy Alliance, a Denver-based trade group. (Sgamma, a longtime critic of Obama’s reforms, now sits on the Interior Department’s Royalty Policy Committee.) Last December, the B.L.M. offered leases on 10\\.3 million acres in the Alaskan Arctic, a sale [that the Trump Administration](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-offshore-auction/u-s-sets-largest-offshore-oil-gas-lease-auction-for-march-idUSKCN1G02CX) touted as the largest in U.S. history. Less than one per cent of the land received bids. In March, the agency tried again, this time with fifteen thousand parcels in the Gulf of Mexico. Although Zinke advertised the auction as a “bellwether” for America’s “energy-dominant” future, barely a tenth of the parcels received bids. \n\nElsewhere, Zinke’s great American fire sale has met with more success. In late March, the B.L.M. sold leases on fifty thousand acres of public land in southeastern Utah, over the protests of tribal leaders, conservationists, and, most notable, another agency within the Interior Department—the [National Park Service](https://eplanning.blm.gov/epl-front-office/projects/nepa/82261/126400/154011/Natl_Park_Service.pdf). Some of the parcels are located within a few miles of the original boundaries of Bears Ears; others are adjacent to Hovenweep, a national monument containing the ruins of six prehistoric Native American villages. In 2015, under Obama, the B.L.M. offered up many of the same parcels for lease, then deferred the auction, noting the need for a closer analysis of the land’s cultural, archeological, and ecological value before development could begin. Under the new Administration, the agency changed course, arguing that the analysis could take place once the bidders put forth their drilling proposals. (In a statement, the B.L.M.’s Utah director, Ed Roberson, said that the agency had “worked diligently with the National Park Service” and “went ahead with the lease sale after resolving their concerns.”)\n\nAcross Utah and other Western states, there is a huge surplus of leased but undeveloped oil-and-gas parcels. Right now, the Interior Department source told me, the land sold in March shows little potential for lucrative development. So why did the industry bid on it? Bloch suggested two possible reasons. First, he said, companies sometimes stockpile leases because it looks good to their investors: in theory, more assets mean more reserves, which mean more profit down the road. (Never mind that the reserves may not actually exist.) Second, some buyers purchase undesirable leases with the hope of unloading them when better extraction technologies or a needier market increase their value. In March, Bloch said, “that was borne out by looking at who showed up for the lease sale—wildcatters, speculators, unknowns.” The largest buyer, Ayers Energy, [has no record of bidding](https://www.sltrib.com/news/environment/2018/04/07/in-utah-canyons-where-an-ancient-civilization-once-flourished-the-feds-are-now-inviting-oil-and-gas-drilling/) on public lands in the West in recent years.\n\nBloch’s comments raise another question: If the leased land isn’t going to be developed anyway, why shouldn’t the government make some money from all that unused space? Isn’t that a win-win? Absolutely not, Bloch and Nada Culver, the Wilderness Society’s senior counsel, told me. Once the land is leased, they noted, the B.L.M. has a legal obligation to see that it delivers what the lessee wants. In addition, the agency most often sells its leases without any stipulation preventing surface occupancy, meaning that some development—clearing brush, building roads, drilling wells—may occur. Once that happens, any possibility of using the land for conservation or recreation, or preserving it because it is sacred to local tribal groups, goes out the window. In other words, Trump and Zinke are using “energy independence and economic growth” to justify the sale of lands that are unlikely to provide either. “These are high-risk areas,” Culver said, referring not just to the land that was leased in March but to all of southeastern Utah’s red-rock country. “To be gambling with this place simply to make a statement of principle is profoundly disturbing.”","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"sections":[{"id":"596e656cd1f51261132e868e","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Elements","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"elements"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"590c9eaeda97f12ef9160003","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Carolyn Kormann has been a contributor to the *The New Yorker* since 2012, and became a staff writer in 2018, covering energy, the environment, and climate change.

The name of the project referred to a campaign to limit the rise in average global temperature to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times. Since the 2009 United Nations climate talks, in Copenhagen, the consensus among scientists and policymakers has been that two degrees Celsius should be the limit; any further temperature increase would be catastrophic. But, for the citizens of small island countries and other vulnerable places in the tropics and the Arctic, even two degrees of [warming](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/climate-change) would be a death sentence. Their communities would be inundated, and eventually destroyed. This could happen by the time the children in the film reached middle age.\n\nLater that year, at the climate talks in Paris, “1\\.5 to Stay Alive” had become a rallying cry for the leaders of the Alliance of Small Island States, which includes countries like the Bahamas, the Maldives, and the Marshall Islands. As a result, the final Paris Agreement declared that, while warming shall not surpass two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels (the target now commonly cited), countries should pursue “efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees C.” The Alliance of Small Island States also asked the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (I.P.C.C.)—the scientific body that informs the climate policies of the United Nations’ member states—to prepare a special report on the specific impacts of global warming of 1.5 degrees, along with ways the world could feasibly keep the temperature from rising further. “We needed literature on the conditions of the 1.5-degree world, so this spurred a tremendous amount of new research,” William Solecki, a climate scientist at Hunter College, in New York, and one of the report’s lead authors, told me. “As soon as the ink was drying on the Paris Agreement, we were off.”\n\nLast night, in Incheon, South Korea, after a week of deliberation, the I.P.C.C. released the new findings. The summary tells a nightmarish tale—one much worse than any of those in the I.P.C.C.’s previous reports—surveying the climate-change impacts we’re already experiencing with one degree of warming, and the severity of the impacts to come once we surpass 1\\.5 degrees of warming. Ten million more people would be exposed to permanent inundation, and several hundred million more to “climate-related risks and susceptible to poverty.” Malaria and dengue fever will be more widespread, and crops like maize, rice, and wheat will have smaller and smaller yields—particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, and Central and South America. Security and economic growth will be that much more imperilled. “Robust scientific literature now shows that there are significant differences between 1\\.5 and 2 degrees,” Adelle Thomas, a geographer from the Bahamas and also one of the report’s lead authors, told me. “The scientific consensus is really strong. It’s not just a political slogan: ‘1.5 to stay alive.’ It’s true.” \n\nThe report marks the start of  the I.P.C.C.’s latest assessment cycle, the sixth since the organization was formed by the U.N. Environment Program and the World Meteorological Organization, in 1988\\. Its importance is hard to overstate. The thirty-three-page summary for policymakers—which is based on more than six thousand cited studies, and written by ninety-one authors from forty different countries—is a collective scream sieved through the stern, strained language of bureaucratese. Unique ecosystems will vanish and species will go extinct by the thousands. With two degrees of warming, three times as many insects (eighteen per cent), and twice as many plants (sixteen per cent) and vertebrates (eight per cent), will lose their geographic range, when compared with warming of 1\\.5 degrees. Nearly all the coral reefs (more than ninety-nine per cent) will be dead, including the Great Barrier Reef, an ecosystem some twenty-five million years old, which is visible from space and is already in severe decline. The global annual catch from marine fisheries will decrease by three million tons. The likelihood of a sea-ice-free Arctic summer will increase from once per century to once per decade. “The next few years are probably the most important in our history,” Debra Roberts, a co-chair of the I.P.C.C. Working Group II,  said. (There are three working groups: one focussed on the physical science of climate change; the second on impacts, adaptation, and vulnerabilities; and the third on mitigation.)  \n\nTo keep warming at 1\\.5 degrees, governments and private businesses must make unprecedented changes—on a sweeping global scale—in energy systems, land management, building efficiency, industrial operations, shipping and aviation, and city-wide design. Within the next decade, human-caused carbon-dioxide emissions need to fall forty-five per cent below 2010 levels. By 2050, net carbon-dioxide emissions must equal zero. “It’s a goal that we can aspire to, but maybe not meet,” Jennifer Francis, a climate scientist at Rutgers University who studies Arctic warming and its impacts on global climate, said. “So it’s useful, even if it isn’t all that realistic.”\n\n“Human activities,” the report’s authors note, have already caused the global mean temperature to increase as much as 1\\.2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, with greater warming in certain regions, and particularly in the Arctic. Warming has already led to weather extremes such as heat waves and precipitation of increased intensity and frequency. If warming continues at its current rate, it could reach 1.5 degrees by the time a child who is now a toddler starts high school. The longer countries take to reduce energy consumption and transition to renewable energy sources like solar and wind, the more they will have to rely on technologies such as [carbon removal](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/11/20/can-carbon-dioxide-removal-save-the-world), which are currently too expensive, experimental, and small-scale to do the job. \n\n“You have to think in terms of the survival of human society,” Benjamin Horton, a British geographer who is currently leading the creation of a sea-level-rise adaptation plan for Singapore and who will serve as an editor for a later segment of the I.P.C.C.’s sixth assessment report, said. “It’s not only the magnitude of change, it’s the pace at which it changes,” he said. The rate of sea-level rise accelerates once the West Antarctic Ice Sheet hits its tipping point—likely set to occur somewhere between 1\\.5 and two degrees of warming, if it hasn’t occurred already—when physics demands the whole sheet will irreversibly disintegrate. At that point, Horton said, “You can’t do anything about it. It is very hard to grow an ice sheet, but very easy to melt.” \n\nAs things stand now, even if every country met the commitment it made in the Paris Agreement, the temperature would still increase to three degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels by the end of the century. If the world continues burning fossil fuels and emitting greenhouse gases at the current rate, it could rise by four degrees—a fact that the Trump Administration, which withdrew the United States from the Paris Agreement, in June, 2017, acknowledged with language buried deep in an August draft report issued in  support of eliminating Obama-era fuel-economy rules. Representatives from the Trump Administration were in Incheon and had to approve the conclusions of the report. Whether President Trump will respond to its findings remains to be seen. But Adelle Thomas told me that during the draft process, while authors were reviewing more than forty thousand comments submitted by different nations, “there was a real difference between developed countries and non-developed countries.” The former, she said, “wanted to soften the report, and take out anything that specifically mentions island states, challenging why small developing islands should be considered a special case.” \n\nFor these regions, faster rates of sea-level rise allow much less time to adapt—to restore natural coastal ecosystems and reinforce infrastructure. “Above 1\\.5 it becomes even more difficult for small islands to plan and recover economically from any damage,” Thomas said. “There are issues of migration and reduced social cohesion after repeated extreme events.” At the U.N. talks in 2010, rich countries had promised to provide financial support of as much as a hundred billion dollars collectively (or one per cent of their total G.D.P.s), to developing nations by 2020, to help with the transition to a low-carbon economy and with adapting to climate impacts they already experience. Rich nations have not followed through on that promise; this year, both the United States and Australia declared that they would no longer be contributing any money at all. \n\nHeads of state and international leaders will meet in Poland, in December, for the next round of U.N. climate-change talks. They have been given a map of the scale and urgency of the risks that island nations, and the rest of the world, now face, and also specific, feasible pathways to reduced emissions. The science is settled. The only question now is whether the world can find the political—or moral—will to do anything about it. “The report is an assessment of the current scientific understanding,” Solecki, who co-authored the first chapter, told me. “The tone of the report paints a challenging picture, but one that also can be viewed as an opportunity.”\n\n","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"sections":[{"id":"590a02541c7a8e33fb390be1","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News Desk","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news-desk"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"590c9eaeda97f12ef9160003","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Carolyn Kormann has been a contributor to the *The New Yorker* since 2012, and became a staff writer in 2018, covering energy, the environment, and climate change.

When he was sixteen, after gangsters in Honduras threatened to kill him, he made the trip with two other boys, but they were attacked by extortionists at the Mexican border, robbed, and eventually apprehended by Mexican authorities. (“We were like three little sheep thrown to ten lions,” he said.) Two years later, he undertook the journey again, this time with a slightly larger group. In Mexico, he fell from a moving freight train—part of a network that spans the country known as the Beast—and lost an arm, half of one leg, and part of his left hand. Once more he was deported to Honduras. When he finally left the hospital, after a two-year recovery, Hernández began planning another trip. “If we don’t risk anything, we don’t live,” he told me. “There aren’t any other options.” In 2015, he joined a group of disabled Honduran asylum seekers who called themselves the Caravan of the Mutilated, and together they reached Texas. \n\nI called Hernández earlier this week because [Donald Trump](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump) had just learned that, after [a similar episode](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-administration-is-rushing-to-turn-trumps-latest-immigration-tweets-into-a-real-policy) in April, a large group of Honduran migrants was once again heading north toward the U.S. The President’s ranting began, on Twitter, as the group crossed the Guatemalan border, still about a thousand miles south of Texas. Trump called them “*CRIMINALS*{:.small},” blamed their trip on “open border” Democrats, vowed to “*CLOSE OUR SOUTHERN BORDER*{:.small},” and threatened to cut off aid to all the Central American governments who had “no control over their population.” Late last week, when the migrants first gathered in San Pedro Sula, in northern Honduras, the group consisted of roughly six hundred people; by Wednesday, their ranks had swelled to around four thousand. “This is how it works,” Hernández told me. “People making the trip see others, they see the bigger group, and they join it. These are people fleeing for their lives. It’s not some coördinated, political thing.” \n\nAn agreement among the governments of Central America allows citizens of Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador, and Nicaragua to move freely across the countries’ borders without the need for passports. But they still have to go through government checkpoints along the way, where Trump’s aggressive posturing has had an immediate effect. On Tuesday, Guatemalan police arrested a Honduran journalist named Bartolo Fuentes, the host of a popular radio program on migration, who was accused by the Honduran government of having organized the caravan. (Fuentes was released on Friday; by most accounts, he was covering the caravan in its early stages as a journalist.) According to Fuentes and his wife, U.S. Embassy officials were present for his arrest, which would be highly irregular, not least because the penalty for failing to present oneself to immigration authorities in Guatemala is a thirty-dollar fine but no jail time. (A spokesperson for the State Department told me that no U.S. Embassy personnel were present.)\n\nThe Honduran government, headed by a U.S. ally named Juan Orlando Hernández, has vilified Fuentes as a political actor, emphasizing the fact that, between 2013 and 2017, he served in Congress as a member of an opposition party called *LIBRE*{:.small}. If Trump has the Democrats to scapegoat, Juan Orlando Hernández has *LIBRE*{:.small}, and both leaders stand to gain from portraying the humanitarian crisis as a political one. One piece of widely disseminated government propaganda described Fuentes as “a professional coyote,” or smuggler, and it dismissed the migrants’ caravan as a political ploy by an opposition party to “hurt the image of the [Honduran] government.” The head of the U.S. Embassy in Honduras, Heide Fulton, validated these attacks in an [address](https://twitter.com/USAmbHonduras/status/1052679954134167552) posted on Twitter, where she urged migrants not to be “deceived by false promises made by leaders with political aims.”  \n\nHernández, in particular, has reason to be defensive: in November, with the Americans’ backing, he won reëlection despite [international outcry](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/in-honduras-calls-rise-for-new-presidential-elections) over massive and demonstrable fraud. (An official working for a company hired by the government to tabulate the ballot data told me, “It was an old-school hijacking—stuffing votes in ballot boxes.”) When one migrant on the caravan heard about Trump’s threat to cut aid to governments in the region, he said, in a [video that subsequently circulated online](https://twitter.com/nomadagt/status/1052661442506194944), “[Trump] is not taking anything away from me. The person he would be taking money from is Juan Orlando Hernández, who’s been grabbing it for himself.” \n\nDonald Trump, who’s been stumping for congressional Republicans, is now calling the [November midterms](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/midterms-2018) the “election of the caravan,” and says that the Democrats support the “illegal immigration onslaught” because they “figure everybody coming in is going to vote Democrat.” For his Administration, the political rhetoric and the policy agenda are effectively indistinguishable. In the last several months, [over the objections of regional experts and diplomatic staff](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-battle-inside-the-trump-administration-over-tps), officials at the State Department and the Department of Homeland Security have wound down a number of programs meant to provide legal relief to those seeking refuge in the U.S. This summer, Attorney General Jeff Sessions unilaterally [redrew](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-trump-administration-is-completely-unraveling-the-us-asylum-system) decades of jurisprudence to make it significantly more difficult for migrants fleeing gang violence and domestic abuse to seek asylum. Meanwhile, tens of thousands of migrants from Central America continue to stream north, fleeing conditions that the Trump Administration has [dismissed](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/us-ally-says-he-won-honduras-presidential-election-hondurans-disagree) as irrelevant.\n\nFor all the Administration’s avowals of toughness, none of its strategies has helped stem the flow. According to unpublished government data obtained by the Washington *Post*, Border Patrol has apprehended more than a hundred thousand migrant family members in the last year, which is about thirty thousand more arrests than the previous peak, in 2016\\. The rationale for the President’s harshest measures, from the indefinite detention of asylum seekers to the separation of families at the border, was that they would deter other migrants from making the trip. The government’s own data contradicts that, and so Trump’s enforcement policy is stuck in a feedback loop: he’s been defending actions that haven’t changed migration patterns, while simultaneously citing a “border crisis” as the reason to double down.\n\nThe fact that more people are coming to the U.S. appears to have caused a heated argument at the White House on Thursday between Trump’s chief of staff, John Kelly, and his national-security adviser, John Bolton. The disagreement did not, by any account, involve how the Administration could do more to address the underlying causes of regional migration. Rather, it was a political spat over the performance of [Kirstjen Nielsen](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-dhs-secretary-kirstjen-nielsen-became-one-of-president-trumps-fiercest-loyalists), the Secretary of Homeland Security and a protégé of Kelly. According to one former Administration official with knowledge of the conversation, Kelly became “incensed” when Bolton criticized Nielsen’s handling of the caravan and told Kelly that “if she can’t do something about it, then you better do it.” \n\nFor months, the President has [blamed](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/why-trump-is-so-angry-at-his-homeland-security-secretary) Nielsen for the increase in immigration, even though she’s been a reliable enforcer of Trump’s agenda. In April, Nielsen and Sessions announced the zero-tolerance policy at the border, which gave rise to the [family-separation crisis](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/border-crisis) during the spring and summer. Eventually, after national protests and the intervention of a federal judge, the Trump Administration announced an end to the practice of separating families. But, in July, a group of top Administration officials, reporting to Stephen Miller, [began meeting](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/will-anyone-in-the-trump-administration-ever-be-held-accountable-for-the-zero-tolerance-policy) at the headquarters of Customs and Border Protection, in Washington, to devise a new and more expansive set of enforcement policies. Last week, amid [reports](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/immigration/trump-administration-weighs-new-family-separation-effort-at-border/2018/10/12/45895cce-cd7b-11e8-920f-dd52e1ae4570_story.html) that the President had considered resuming family separation at the border, Trump told “60 Minutes,” “Well, we’re looking at a lot of things. What I can say is this: there are consequences from coming into a country, namely our country, illegally.”  \n\nThe problem, as José Luis Hernández, in Los Angeles, pointed out when we spoke Thursday, was that there was nothing illegal about the caravan. The migrants had, at that point, broken no laws and were exercising internationally protected rights to seek refuge. Like others in the past, this caravan will likely disperse as the migrants reach Mexico, which, since 2015, has deported more people back to Central America than the U.S. government. Under pressure from the U.S. to stop the group from advancing, the Mexican government said it would offer some form of relief to most of the migrants in the caravan, but that it would only allow a few hundred of them to petition for asylum each day. (“These people are in great need,” Mexico’s Ambassador to Guatemala [told](https://www.wsj.com/articles/migrant-caravan-masses-near-mexican-border-1539952930) the *Wall Street Journal.* “The border is not closed.”) On Friday afternoon, when the group arrived at Mexico’s southern border, hundreds of migrants tore down a thin metal fence and entered the country as some five hundred federal policemen looked on. \n\n“The history of these caravans goes back to the late nineteen-nineties,” Hernández explained. “They began as groups of mothers travelling together to search for their kids—their daughters and sons—who had disappeared while travelling north through Guatemala and Mexico.” Hernández, who is far angrier with the President of Honduras, whom he faulted for exacerbating the violence, poverty, and corruption racking the country, than he is with Trump, said that the symbolism of these caravans was inseparable from their practical necessity. “No one ever wants to migrate,” he said. “The whole thing is a fight not to become invisible.” ","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"sections":[{"id":"590a02541c7a8e33fb390be1","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"590a02541c7a8e33fb390be1","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News Desk","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news-desk"},{"id":"5904126172dadf5d0a508800","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news"},{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"}],"name":"News Desk","parent":[{"id":"5904126172dadf5d0a508800","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"},"slug":"news-desk"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"web","contributors":[{"id":"590a0738fba4e90c8d8d92ff","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Jonathan Blitzer is a staff writer at *The New Yorker*.

On the other end of the line, the speaker identified himself, in Spanish, as a U.S. government official. “Are you bringing or receiving anyone coming to the United States?” the official asked. Jorge said no, but then a thought occurred to him: earlier in the summer, his sister in Guatemala had mentioned that her seventeen-year-old son, Pedro, might travel north to live with his grandparents in the United States. “Could it be Pedro?” Jorge asked the official. “That’s him,” the official replied. \n\nPedro had just been apprehended in Texas while trying to enter the country alone, and he was being held at a shelter overseen by the Office of Refugee Resettlement (O.R.R.), which places unaccompanied children with family members living in the U.S. In Guatemala, local gangsters had threatened to kill him; to keep word from getting out, Pedro didn’t tell anyone his exact plans to flee. Before leaving, though, he copied his uncle’s number from his mother’s cell phone and eventually gave it to American authorities at the border after his capture. Pedro’s grandparents, who are also Jorge’s parents and live near him in Virginia, knew nothing about their grandson’s trip. The call between Jorge and the government official lasted less than five minutes. “We’re going to be calling back in a few days,” he told Jorge. “Answer the phone when we do.”\n\nPedro is now being held in an emergency shelter in Tornillo, Texas, a [tent city](https://www.newyorker.com/news/current/the-ongoing-avoidable-horror-of-the-trump-administrations-texas-tent-camp-for-migrant-kids) where the government has transferred hundreds of minors in recent weeks, often under [the cover of night](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/30/us/migrant-children-tent-city-texas.html), in an effort to address an escalating crisis. Nationwide, there are currently 13,200 children in O.R.R. custody, more than ever before, and five times more than were being held in the spring of last year. Shelters have become overcrowded not because more children are fleeing north than in years past but mainly because the Trump Administration has made it more difficult to release them. In April, the O.R.R. signed an agreement with Immigration and Customs Enforcement to share information about the legal status of children’s sponsors. Those who come forward to claim family members can now be arrested and deported if they are here illegally. As a result, immigrant families have had to make a choice: sponsor children and risk deportation, or keep their distance while children languish in government custody. As families weigh the stakes, children have been spending longer periods of time in detention. Officially, the H.H.S. claims that the average time is fifty-nine days, but according to one of the department’s own officials, who agreed to speak with me on the condition of anonymity, detained children now spend an average of seventy-four days in federal custody, more than double what it was at the start of 2016.\n\nJorge, who is broad-chested, with a goatee and close-cropped hair, is undocumented. After receiving the phone call in August, he told me that he spent a day thinking through his options. “The main thing at first was that I didn’t want to panic my mother,” he said. “I was going to do something to get Pedro out of detention. It was just a question of how to do it. If I’m the sponsor, and they deport me, what are my kids going to do?” His two children in Virginia—both American citizens—are twelve and six years old. He and his wife also have a sixteen-year-old daughter in Guatemala who was born just after Jorge arrived in the United States. (Before leaving Guatemala to join him, Jorge’s wife placed their daughter in the care of her mother; the couple planned to send for her when she was older.) Without legal papers, Jorge has never been able to travel home to see her. “I want to bring her here,” he said. “I’m not all here without her. But look what’s happened to Pedro. It’s a bad time to try this.” \n\nLast week, I met Jorge and his parents, Ana and Victor, who are also undocumented, at their lawyer’s office in Virginia. Each of them wore name tags with pseudonyms written in black marker. “It’s so we can remind ourselves of what we’re supposed to call each other while we talk to you,” Ana told me. She left a small town in southern Guatemala ten years ago to follow her husband, who came to the U.S., in 1999, after Hurricane Mitch destroyed their home and the field of maize that the family tended for its livelihood. Ana, who is trim, with dark hair and big, watchful eyes, cleans office buildings at night. “I was horrified when I found out about Pedro,” she said. “I couldn’t stand the thought that he was being detained.” While his wife spoke, Victor, dressed in a plaid work shirt, cradled a black baseball cap in his hands, and occasionally checked his phone; he’d taken time off of work, in construction, to speak with me. At first, the family had been wary of dealing directly with the federal government, and Ana asked a friend with legal status to sponsor Pedro on their behalf. When the friend declined, Ana realized the family had to take the risk themselves. “I felt like I wanted to bury myself alive,” she said. \n\nWithin a few days, they came up with a tentative plan. Ana is illiterate, and the prospect of a protracted bureaucratic process intimidated her; Jorge would help her with the details. Because the government had asked for two contacts, Ana offered to serve as the primary sponsor, with Jorge as the secondary one. Both began talking regularly with Pedro’s case worker, who explained that they would need to submit fingerprints, identity documents, and proof of an income level that was sufficient to support a child. “The whole thing scared me,” Jorge said. He and Ana decided to look for a lawyer, which took about two weeks. After an initial meeting, they decided that Victor should be the secondary sponsor instead. “I wanted to stay off to the side,” Jorge said. “But I continued going with them to meet with the lawyer, and I took my mother to the offices she needed to visit to get everything in order.” \n\nThere are legitimate reasons for why the process of sponsoring an unaccompanied minor is so rigorous. In 2016, after tens of thousands of unaccompanied minors from Central America arrived at the border and overwhelmed federal authorities, the Senate issued a report detailing more than a dozen cases of children who were released to abusive sponsors, because background checks had been relaxed in response to the influx. Vetting sponsors has always been predicated on protecting children, not policing sponsors; in the past, officials from the Department of Health and Human Services made a point of stressing their independence from the Department of Homeland Security. “O.R.R. is not a law-enforcement entity,” Robert Carey, the former head of the office, [told](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/why-are-undocumented-minors-spending-so-much-time-in-custody) me. “It’s a social-service provider.”\n\nNow, according to advocates, the Trump Administration is manipulating the mission of the O.R.R. “They’ve flipped their mandate from the children’s welfare to immigration enforcement,” Jennifer Podkul, the policy director of Kids in Need of Defense, told me. “What that’s done is kept kids in detention longer, and led to sponsors backing out.” As the government has requested more information, including fingerprints, from any adult who may come into contact with a released child, many undocumented family members have begun moving out of households where sponsors live. Last month, Matthew Albence, a senior official at *ICE*{: .small}, told Congress that his agency had arrested forty-one sponsors between July and September, seventy per cent of whom had no criminal record. \n\nAna and Victor agreed to sponsor Pedro before these arrests became public, but they already knew they’d be vulnerable. “There was so much the government kept asking me to do, and I didn’t understand why,” Ana said. Early last month, she attended a mandatory information session for sponsors, held at a nearby immigration court. “I couldn’t sleep the night before,” she said. “I thought they were going to arrest me there.” Several days later, Jorge drove Ana and Victor to Maryland to be fingerprinted, because the offices in Virginia were backed up. “We still haven’t heard anything about Pedro,” Jorge said. “And now my parents have everything on the line.”  \n\nIn mid-September, the family learned that Pedro was being transferred to Tornillo. “That was a whole other anxiety,” Jorge said. “I always watch the news, and I was seeing that things were pretty bad there.” As a result of the Trump Administration’s [zero-tolerance policy](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-the-trump-administration-got-comfortable-separating-immigrant-kids-from-their-parents), children separated from their parents at the border were being treated as unaccompanied minors. O.R.R. [couldn’t house all of them](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-office-of-refugee-resettlement-is-completely-unprepared-for-the-thousands-of-immigrant-children-now-in-its-care). After a federal judge ordered the government to reunite the families, releasing the separated children from the O.R.R. became an all-consuming priority for H.H.S.; the children who’d come to the U.S. alone, like Pedro, were overlooked. One former O.R.R. official told me at the time, “I’m worried the unaccompanied kids O.R.R. is supposed to be taking care of are getting ignored because of all the chaos.” Throughout the summer, there were reports of migrant children being mistreated at government-run shelters across the country, particularly along the border. “We didn’t seem to have problems on this scale before,” the former official said.\n\nThe continued delays in releasing unaccompanied children have given rise to another concern. The Trump Administration is said to be holding some older teen-agers in O.R.R. custody until they turn eighteen, at which point, as legal adults, the government can transfer them to *ICE*{: .small} for deportation. Becky Wolozin, a lawyer with an advocacy group called the Legal Aid Justice Center, in Virginia, told me, “I represented a kid before an immigration judge arguing that he should be released. He was close to his eighteenth birthday, and the judge said he was not dangerous and did not need to be held. But the O.R.R. sat on it. When he turned eighteen, they just transferred him to adult detention.” (Wolozin challenged the detention, and her client was later released.) In August, the Legal Aid Justice Center filed a class-action lawsuit on behalf of four other unaccompanied minors between the ages of thirteen and seventeen who were being held in Virginia, alleging that they had been detained “for excessive amounts of time”—more than five months in some cases—and were “illegally and improperly denied reunification with their families.” \n\nPedro will turn eighteen in a few months. When I met with Jorge, Ana, and Victor, it had been eight days since they’d last spoken to him. Ana and Victor submitted their fingerprints in late September, yet the government still hasn’t given them any updates about Pedro’s release; they told me they didn’t even know if their fingerprints had cleared. During our conversation, Victor sat with his arms folded across his chest, his gaze drifting. Of the three of them, he was the only one who avoided mentioning the word “fear.” There was a trace of fatalism in his voice but also firmness. “It all comes down to a decision we’ve made,” he said. “Either the government sends Pedro here or it sends Pedro back. We want him here. There’s hope that we’ll be able to do that for him. There’s also hopelessness—and that’s about what might happen to us. Maybe we’ll all be sent back together.”","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"sections":[{"id":"5a8c99f952e589162b850cbc","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Dispatch","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"dispatch"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"590a0738fba4e90c8d8d92ff","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Jonathan Blitzer is a staff writer at *The New Yorker*.

On the ninth day of every month, she would receive a hundred and ninety dollars from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, informally known as food stamps. The benefits belonged to her eleven-year-old daughter, who is a U.S. citizen, but they came on a  card issued by the government in Arelii’s name. The following weekend, Arelii would go to the supermarket. “I try to pack my daughter with sandwiches, juice, things like that,” she told me recently. “The schools don’t give the kids anything half-decent to eat.” Arelii cleans houses in Brooklyn, and her husband works at a deli in Manhattan. They are both undocumented and ineligible for food stamps, as is their son, who was nine when he came to the United States and is now twenty and in the process of applying for his green card.\n\nThis August, when it was time to renew her daughter’s food stamps, Arelii decided against it. She had heard rumors, on television and on Facebook, that the President had a new plan to punish immigrants who were receiving public benefits. If a family accepted them in any form, Arelii was told, no one in the household could qualify for a green card. Although these rumors were inaccurate, they were based on a widely reported development: the Trump Administration was considering ways to revamp the access that immigrants have to public benefits. That fact was enough to intimidate Arelii, given what she knew about [Donald Trump](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump). “These benefits were going to be a block on my son’s application,” she told me. “I was divided in two. To give my son a chance, I had to take something away from my daughter.” \n\nLast weekend, in a four-hundred-and-fifty-page document, the Department of Homeland Security announced a newly proposed regulation to dramatically expand the list of public benefits that the government would treat as “negative factors” in visa and green-card applications. For the past twenty years, only cash-based assistance amounting to more than fifty per cent of a person’s income could potentially be disqualifying. Non-cash benefits, such as food stamps and Medicaid, will now count, too. The threshold for how much public assistance the government can flag as excessive is also being lowered considerably. At the same time, a broad new array of personal factors, including financial status, education, and family size, will count against immigration petitions in unprecedented ways. According to a recent report from the Migration Policy Institute, the proposed standards—which will disproportionately affect immigrants from Central America, Africa, and Asia—are a “modern-day version of the National Origins Quota Act of 1924,” a law that “sought to tilt immigration to Western Europe.” Mark Greenberg, a senior fellow at M.P.I., told me, “The proposal is giving the Administration enormous discretion over who enters the country and who can get a green card.” An even bigger concern, he said, is that many immigrant families, out of fear, might forgo benefits to which they’re legally entitled.\n\nOn Tuesday, Arelii and I met at the offices of Make the Road New York, an immigrant-advocacy organization, in Jackson Heights, Queens, where staff members were holding a training session on the government’s proposal. By then, she and her family had gone more than a month without their food stamps. Arelii wanted to increase her hours at work, but she can’t afford a babysitter, and the money she spends to get to Brooklyn for work each week—twelve dollars for a MetroCard, four dollars for bread and coffee to snack on—cuts into her actual earnings (eighty dollars for two days of work a week). “My husband has been working at two separate delis,” Arelii told me. “He leaves every morning at four-thirty and comes home at nine-thirty at night. That’s before my daughter wakes up every day, and after she goes to sleep. They can only see each other on the weekends. She asks us why this is, and we tell her, ‘We’re working on a special project right now.’&nbsp;”\n\nAfter earlier versions of the proposal surfaced—in the form of an unsigned executive order dating to January, 2017, and a leaked draft of the D.H.S. regulation from March—fears about accepting public benefits became entrenched in communities across the country, especially in states with large immigrant populations and robust public-benefit programs. (Of the nearly eighteen million immigrant families who received public benefits between 2014 and 2016, some seven million—about forty-one per cent—live in California and New York.) “Eight months ago was around the first time we started to feel it,” Arline Cruz, one of the staff members at Make the Road, told me. “People started cancelling their benefits. We keep telling members, ‘Don’t stop getting the services you need to survive. This is still only a proposal!’&nbsp;” Even the most recent proposed guidelines are still months from going into effect, she said, and they will not be imposed retroactively. Arelii understood the advice, but she was reluctant to take any chances. “They tell me it won’t affect my son’s application,” she said. “But I don’t want to risk anything. No one knows anything for sure.” \n\nUncertainty about the details of the government’s proposal is making it difficult for advocates to counsel community members, many of whom have already received conflicting advice from immigration lawyers, media reports, and anguished neighbors. The collective confusion is understandable: not only is the Administration’s new plan in flux (there will be a two-month period for public comment before it’s adopted) but this is also the first time since 1999 that the benefits policy for immigrants has been overhauled. In the past, the government distinguished between immigrants who were “receiving” government assistance and those who were “primarily dependent” on it, a distinction that the Trump Administration is now trying to efface. D.H.S. is proposing a set of formulas for determining which immigrants are labelled a “public charge,” meaning that they are considered overly dependent on public assistance and therefore ineligible for legal status. “It’s very hard to figure out why the government would put out such a complex standard,” Greenberg, of M.P.I., said. “People will not be able to figure out which side of the line they fall on.” Other changes are less technical but more alarming. If an immigrant comes from a large family or has an existing health condition, these could be considered “negative factors.” And if that person’s income is within a hundred and twenty-five per cent of the federal poverty line—roughly thirty thousand dollars for a family of four—it would be another mark against her. “Even if someone isn’t receiving a public benefit, they could in the future,” according to Greenberg. “That’s the idea behind this.”\n\nBy the end of the training session, which lasted an hour, the message was provisional but clear. “Folks should not cancel their benefits just yet,” Sienna Fontaine, a legal director at Make the Road, told the group. Afterward, I asked Arelii if she was persuaded to renew her daughter’s food stamps, at least for now. “I’m feeling fifty-per-cent better,” she told me. “I’m still not sure, though. I’m scared there’s something I might do that could hurt my son’s application.” Even if the new proposals were adopted immediately, the food stamps that Arelii’s daughter receives would not affect her son’s green-card application; he isn’t a direct recipient of the food stamps and thus is not at risk of getting penalized for them. When I asked Arelii if this changed her thinking, she told me it didn’t. “The danger is still too great,” she said.\n\nIn 1996, after Congress passed a welfare-reform bill that curtailed immigrants’ access to public assistance, tens of thousands of additional immigrants who weren’t affected by the law nevertheless stopped using benefits, as a precaution. By 1998, the use of food stamps by noncitizen families had fallen by forty per cent, with particularly steep drop-offs (about sixty per cent) among refugees, even though they remained eligible for the assistance. The effect was especially pronounced on children who were U.S. citizens and lived in households where at least one of the parents was not. More than half of them went off food stamps, despite the fact that, as Dara Lind pointed out recently, at [Vox](https://www.vox.com/2018/9/24/17892350/public-charge-immigration-food-stamps-medicaid-trump), the law “was supposed to allow them to stay on.” In 1999, the Clinton Administration issued special guidance to mitigate the damage. Barbara Strack, who recently retired from her role as an official at D.H.S., helped draft those clarifying directives, which remain in effect. (The Trump Administration’s proposed regulation will supplant them.) “We were acutely aware of the chilling effects, and one part of the policymaking was about minimizing them,” she said. “Now it seems like it’s the opposite: the Administration is embracing the chilling effect so it can achieve its goal of having people un-enroll even before the regulation becomes operative.” \n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, in the back part of the Make the Road office, a woman from Ecuador named Maria asked a benefits counsellor for advice. Maria was the third person that day to come to the office to try to cancel her benefits. She and her husband are currently applying for their green cards, and they receive food stamps and emergency Medicaid coverage for their eight-year-old daughter, who is a U.S citizen and has special needs. An immigration lawyer had told them, inaccurately, that they needed to end their benefits in order to stay qualified for legal permanent residency. “I heard this from my cousins, too,” she said. “All of them cancelled their food stamps.” Doris Mejia, the benefits counsellor, was gentle but insistent. “This is for your daughter,” she told her.

My husband and I and our two daughters visited my mother-in-law in a small town in the country’s south, where we spent the long, scorching days showing our U.S.-born niece, who was in Haiti for the first time, the sights, and watching [World Cup](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/world-cup) soccer games in the back yard of a neighbor who happened to have a television and was charging people the equivalent of a quarter to watch each game.\n\nThe World Cup was an obsession in our area, as it was in the rest of Haiti, where the Brazilian team is a perennial favorite. There were Brazilian flags everywhere—on cars, motorcycles, and homes—not because Brazil had led *MINUSTAH*{:.small}, the multibillion-dollar, decade-long United Nations peacekeeping [debacle](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/a-new-chapter-for-the-disastrous-united-nations-mission-in-haiti) in Haiti, or because thousands of Haitians had [migrated](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/haiti/article103920161.html) to Brazil during the past decade, but because most Haitians claim Brazil’s soccer team as [their own](https://africasacountry.com/2018/07/brazil-is-in-many-ways-haitis-national-side) and were hoping that the team would win its sixth World Cup in the last sixty years. \n\nAlas, it was not to be. On July 6th, we drove to the home of a family friend in Port Salut, a beautiful coastal town about thirty miles from where we were staying, to watch Brazil face Belgium in the quarter-finals. So many of our friend’s neighbors had come to watch the game that he pitched a makeshift tent in front of his house to accommodate us all. When the match ended and Brazil [lost](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/soccer-insider/wp/2018/07/06/brazil-vs-belgium-2018-world-cup-quarterfinal/), scoring only one goal to Belgium’s two, the young woman sitting next to me began sobbing. I thought she was a superfan who was overcome with grief at the loss, but as she rocked herself she said, “What am I going to do with all the merchandise?” She’d been hoping that the Brazilian team would make it to the finals, she said, and had got a high-interest loan to buy Brazil jerseys, flags, and bracelets to sell. Now the items would be practically worthless, and she was deep in debt. Her anguish was a reminder that the fate of some of the poorest people in Haiti is linked to factors far beyond their control.\n\nPort Salut felt like a graveyard when we left it that evening, and not just because of the disappointment over the World Cup. During Brazil’s final match, the Haitian government had announced that, in order to insure that the country would qualify for low-interest loans from the [International Monetary Fund](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/haiti/article214722915.html), it was substantially [raising the price](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/haiti/article214594110.html) of gasoline and diesel. Even the price of kerosene, which was used to light most homes in the Haitian countryside, was going up by fifty-one per cent.\n\nWe only heard the news on the drive back to my mother-in-law’s, when we began receiving messages from family members and friends advising us to get off the roads to avoid running into roadblocks that had been erected in protest. We encountered nearly a dozen on the way, most of them made from piles of rocks and flaming tires and being guarded by anxious young men. At a back-road riverbed—a last-resort detour—a young moto-taxi-driver, explaining why he and his friends would not let us through, detailed how the sudden gas hike would chip away at the life they were struggling to build for themselves and their families. “We want a future, but they keep snatching it away,” he said.\n\nTwenty-four hours later, the government announced that it was [reversing](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/haiti/article214497129.html) its decision on the gas hike. Days of nationwide protests followed nonetheless. Haiti’s President, Jovenel Moïse, made sometimes scolding and sometimes pleading speeches on television. His Prime Minister resigned. A [new government](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/haiti/article218493170.html) was formed. But a lingering flame of anger remained. Or, at least, rekindled.\n\nIn October of 2017, a Haitian Senate [report](https://www.miamiherald.com/article184740783.html) detailed how, between 2008 and 2016, funds that had been accumulated through Haiti’s participation in Venezuela’s oil-purchasing program, [Petrocaribe](https://www.as-coa.org/articles/explainer-what-petrocaribe), were misused, misappropriated, or embezzled by government officials and their cronies in the private sector. The Petrocaribe agreement, which Haiti signed in 2006, allowed the Haitian government to buy oil from Venezuela, pay sixty per cent of the purchase price within ninety days, and then defer the rest of the debt, at a one-per-cent interest rate, over twenty-five years. This debt has grown to almost two billion dollars over the past decade. The Haitian government controlled the sale of the oil and was supposed to use those funds for social and development projects, including sanitation and health, at a time when ten thousand Haitians had been killed and nearly a million had been affected by a [cholera epidemic](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/18/world/americas/united-nations-haiti-cholera.html) that was introduced by the United Nations. The funds were also supposed to be used to build infrastructure and grow the agricultural sector—the supposed [specialty](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/haiti/article117626878.html) of Moïse, who had nicknamed himself Nèg Bannann, or Banana Man, during his Presidential campaign. The funds could have been used, too, for education, one of the stated [priorities](https://www.voanews.com/a/haiti-struggles-to-begin-free-public-education-133018688/164638.html) of Moïse’s predecessor, [Michel Martelly](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/sweet-micky-and-the-sad-deja-vu-of-haitis-presidential-elections),  whose government added a [dollar-and-fifty-cent surcharge](http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/haiti-new-tax-money-relatives-sparks-outrage-brooklyn-community-article-1.156354) on each money transfer to Haiti from abroad to finance free and universal education. (These funds, totalling millions of dollars a year, remain mostly [unaccounted for](http://www.ijdh.org/2013/04/topics/education-topics/michel-martellys-education-plan-in-haiti-marked-by-mismanagement-and-inflated-claims/).)\n\nThe pilfering of the Petrocaribe funds has been a concern in Haiti for years, but it wasn’t until this summer, when the writer and filmmaker Gilbert Mirambeau, Jr., [tweeted](https://twitter.com/GibszZZz/status/1029445853788991490) a photo showing himself blindfolded like a kidnapping victim, holding a handwritten cardboard sign reading “Kot Kòb Petwo Karibe a???” (“Where is the Petrocaribe money???”), that these grievances began spreading widely online. #KotKòbPetwoKaribea became a popular hashtag, and other Haitians posted images of themselves inspired by Mirambeau’s. Anti-corruption street protests became larger and more frequent, culminating in [massive demonstrations](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/haiti/article220144215.html) on Wednesday in cities in Haiti and in the diaspora. In Port-au-Prince, there were reports of two deaths and [clashes](https://www.voanews.com/a/haiti-police-open-fire-on-protesters-/4617500.html) with police. \n\nI attended a march of around a hundred people in Miami’s Little Haiti neighborhood, where, between chants of “Where’s the money?” and “Catch the thieves,” the protest leaders were already talking about their next outing, on November 18th. That date will mark the two hundred and fifteenth anniversary of the Battle of Vertières, the last major conflict fought before Haiti won its independence from France, under the leadership of, among others, the Haitian founding father Jean-Jacques Dessalines, whose death was also being remembered on Wednesday.\n\nIn a commemorative [speech](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-haiti-petrocaribe/at-least-one-dead-dozens-hurt-as-thousands-protest-graft-in-haiti-idUSKCN1MR37S) delivered near the site where Dessalines was assassinated, Moïse made empty promises about fighting corruption at the highest levels of power. But it seems highly unlikely that his government will perform a satisfactory investigation into the missing Petrocaribe funds—a probe that could implicate himself, his predecessor, and their friends and colleagues. It seems equally unlikely that Haitians will stop asking, on social media and in the streets, “Kot kòb Petrocaribe a?”—“Where’s the Petrocaribe money?”","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"sections":[{"id":"590a02541c7a8e33fb390be1","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"590a02541c7a8e33fb390be1","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News Desk","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news-desk"},{"id":"5904126172dadf5d0a508800","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news"},{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"}],"name":"News Desk","parent":[{"id":"5904126172dadf5d0a508800","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"},"slug":"news-desk"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"web","contributors":[{"id":"590a00e2c14b3c606c109ee7","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"","canonicalUrl":"http://www.newyorker.com/contributors/edwidge-danticat","email":"","name":"Edwidge Danticat","socialMedia":[],"title":"Edwidge Danticat is the author of many books, including, most recently, “[The Art of Death: Writing the Final Story](https://www.amazon.com/Art-Death-Writing-Final-Story/dp/1555977774).”","url":"/contributors/edwidge-danticat"}],"dek":"","hed":"Haitians Want to Know What the Government Has Done with Missing Oil Money","inlineEmbeds":[],"issueDate":"","ledeCaption":"","modifiedAt":"2018-10-19T20:49:46.907Z","photos":{"tout":[{"id":"5bca29d375aaf6710e468c12","modelName":"photo","collection":"photos","aspectRatios":{"2:2":{"width":656,"height":656,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":906,"y":590,"height":656,"width":656}},"duration":null},"16:9":{"width":2560,"height":1440,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":0,"y":198,"height":1440,"width":2560}},"duration":null},"4:3":{"width":2275,"height":1706,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":62,"y":0,"height":1706,"width":2275}},"duration":null},"1:1":{"width":1655,"height":1655,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":551,"y":51,"height":1655,"width":1655}},"duration":null},"master":{"format":"JPEG","url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/tny-services/production/2018/10/19/5bca29d375aaf6710e468c11_Edwidge-HaitiProtests.jpg","width":2560,"height":1707,"duration":null}},"caption":"A protest over missing Petrocaribe funds in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, in August.

I was four years old and she was leaving Haiti for the United States to join my father, who’d emigrated two years earlier, to escape both a dictatorship and poverty. My mother was entrusting my younger brother and me to the care of my uncle and his wife, who would look after us until our parents could establish permanent residency—they had both travelled on tourist visas—in the United States.\n\nOn the day my mother left, I wrapped my arms around her legs before she headed for the plane. She leaned down and tearfully unballed my fists so that my uncle could peel me off her. As my brother dropped to the floor, bawling, my mother hurried away, her tear-soaked face buried in her hands. She couldn’t bear to look back. We would not see her again for three years.\n\nSome may assume that certain immigrant parents, because they leave their children behind, or send them alone on possibly perilous journeys, don’t love their children as much as, say, parents whose parental love is never tested in this way. When I was a teen-ager, I asked my parents about their immigration choices. If the lives of my brother and me had been in danger, or if they’d had no one to leave us with, they certainly would have taken us with them, they said. Though they would have never been granted visas if they hadn’t left us behind to prove that they had a reason to return.\n\nEven the type of carefully planned separation that my parents chose tore their hearts out. Whenever they were eating, my mother used to say, they wondered whether my brother and I were eating, too. When they went to bed at night, they wondered if my brother and I were sleeping. Even though we spoke to them on a scheduled call once a week, they never stopped worrying and longing for us.\n\nIt is perhaps that ache and longing that made my parents take me to visit Haitian refugees and asylum seekers who were being held at a detention center near the  Brooklyn Navy Yard when our family was reunited in New York, in the early nineteen-eighties. Back then, Rudolph Giuliani was the Associate Attorney General of the United States and the most vocal [opponent](https://www.nytimes.com/1982/04/03/world/around-the-world-us-official-finds-no-repression-in-haiti.html) of parole for twenty-one hundred Haitian refugees being held at different detention facilities around the U.S. After travelling to Haiti and speaking to Jean-Claude (Baby Doc) Duvalier, the dictator whom these migrants had fled, Giuliani concluded that the Haitians had nothing to fear and should be deported.\n\nI’ve continued to visit detention facilities over the years, including ones where children are held, either alone or with their parents. It is not easy to enter such places. At many facilities, one can get only a curated view, either alongside a group of journalists or by attaching oneself to a congressional delegation. At a children’s facility in Cutler Bay, Florida, which I used to visit with a registered volunteer, most boys and girls were waiting to be reunited with a parent or relative already living in the United States. Many of these young people had experienced such horrible trauma during their long journey from Central America to the U.S. border with Mexico that they could barely focus on the activities the volunteers prepared for them, which included gardening and crafts. Some had been detained for so long that they’d transitioned from childhood to adolescence behind those walls. Then there were [the Miami hotels](https://www.thenation.com/article/not-your-homeland/) turned detention centers that immigration lawyers and advocate friends would allow me to accompany them to, places where women and children were being held for weeks or months at a time. Up to six women spent twenty-four hours a day in one room, often with crying babies and toddlers, while armed guards patrolled the halls.\n\nOne of the most distressing aspects of immigration detention, for both adults and children, is how invisible the detained can become, even when they’re imprisoned in our proverbial back yards. Had the world not seen the [images of children](https://apnews.com/6e04c6ee01dd46669eddba9d3333f6d5) wrapped in Mylar blankets and sleeping inside cages, and heard babies and toddlers [crying](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/trumps-cruelty-and-the-crying-children) for their parents, both as a result of the Trump Administration’s “zero-tolerance” policy, some might not have believed that these children had been yanked from their parents’ arms—one, reportedly, while [being breast-fed](https://www.cnn.com/videos/us/2018/06/14/undocumented-mother-baby-taken-while-breastfeeding-lavandera-newday.cnn). Even in the light of clear and horrifying evidence, many would rather hold fast to their willful denial, branding the cages sets, the detained children [actors](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2018/06/18/migrant-kids-are-child-actors-ann-coulter-says-on-fox-news-telling-trump-not-to-be-fooled/?utm_term=.7987861106c1), and the detention facilities the equivalent of [boarding schools and summer camps](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2018/06/19/fox-news-laura-ingraham-says-immigrant-child-detention-centers-are-essentially-summer-camps/?utm_term=.026ffa1b502d).\n\nIn May, an A.C.L.U. [report](https://www.aclu.org/news/aclu-obtains-documents-showing-widespread-abuse-child-immigrants-us-custody) produced from thirty thousand pages of official documents, dated  between 2009 and 2014, detailed incidents of U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers verbally, physically, and sexually abusing migrant children. The cases cited include accounts of children being Tased, punched, kicked in the head and ribs. Young migrants complained of being denied food and water and medical care, of being strip-searched and threatened with rape and murder while confined to freezing and unsanitary rooms. Teen-agers detained at the Shenandoah Valley Juvenile Center, in Virginia, testified in court filings that they were [handcuffed to chairs with bags over their heads and were left naked in cold concrete cells](http://time.com/5318165/juvenile-immigrants-virginia-detention-abuse-shenandoah/). Others, detained elsewhere, have reported being thrown on the ground in order to be [force-fed or injected with psychotropic drugs](https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/21/us/undocumented-migrant-children-detention-facilities-abuse-invs/index.html). U.S. Customs and Border Protection has either [dismissed or denied](https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/speeches-and-statements/cbp-s-response-unfounded-aclu-report) these charges.\n\nThis is what may await many of the children who have already been separated from their parents under the current Administration’s zero-tolerance policy. (The Department of Homeland Security has said that, out of the twenty-three hundred separated children, five hundred and twenty-two [have been reunited](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/24/us/migrant-children-reunited.html) with their parents.) The [executive order that Trump passed last week](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-new-border-crisis-following-trumps-executive-order) to end family separation makes no provisions for the children who are still separated from their parents.\n\nSome of these children have already arrived in Florida, where I live. Last Saturday, a social-worker friend and I drove around the fenced perimeters of one of those facilities, the His House Children’s Home, in Miami Gardens, which, according to [the Miami *Herald*](http://www.miamiherald.com/article213729394.html), is currently housing ten children ranging from “newborns to 5 year olds.” Made up of a series of yellow and beige buildings, some of which are boarded up, His House Children’s Home has been linked to the death of at least one child, who [suffocated](http://www.miaminewtimes.com/news/miami-child-migrant-facility-accused-of-letting-child-suffocate-10460856) under a blanket, in 2007\\. His House has also been accused, by some of the U.S.-born children who have been placed in foster care there, of treating them like [prisoners](http://www.miamiherald.com/latest-news/article211177094.html). His House staff has denied that children are mistreated there. My friend works in the state foster system, and said that places like His House are a last resort for the children in her care. “Here we are trying to do all we can to keep children with their parents, and our country is separating other children from theirs,” she said.\n\nJennifer Anzardo Valdes, the program director of the Children’s Legal Program at the Florida-based Americans for Immigrant Justice, has represented unaccompanied minors in the foster-care system and also those in immigration detention. Her team is now representing some of the children who have been taken from their parents at the border. Valdes and her team were aware of families being separated months before the [zero-tolerance policy was officially announced](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-the-trump-administration-got-comfortable-separating-immigrant-kids-from-their-parents), by Attorney General Jeff Sessions, in April. One of their clients, Ana, a three-year-old girl from Guatemala, was separated from her father in July, 2017. Ana’s father came to the U.S. with her; her mother, who stayed behind, died shortly afterward. They were held together in a crowded facility for two days. Then Ana’s father was told that she was going to be looked after elsewhere. Nobody told him where she was being taken. He was told that they would return her to him when he was released. Before he was deported, in early December, 2017, he asked if he could take her with him. He has not seen her since. \n\n\n+++inset-right\n\n[#externallink: /externallinks/5b2d043f87016730a4fd0ea7]||||||\n\n+++\n\nAna was released into the custody of relatives in South Florida this past January. If not for Valdes and her team, and other immigration lawyers like them, many migrant children, like Ana, would have to find their ways through the immigration system alone. Valdes uses a coloring book, designed by her organization and illustrated by a local artist, to help small children like Ana make sense of the immigration process. One illustration in their “Conozca sus Derechos” (“Know Your Rights”) brochure shows a smiling family of four holding hands. Another page shows a map of the United States, to help the children identify where they are. Another shows a Santa Claus-like judge with the words “La Corte” (“The Court”) printed above his head. “I’m sure you can imagine the challenges we have trying to explain the court process to a three-year-old,” Valdes said.\n\n It’s worth remembering that the Trump Administration has been finding ways to divide families from the very beginning. The so-called [Muslim ban](https://www.aclu.org/issues/immigrants-rights/living-muslim-ban) kept U.S citizens and others from being reunited with their spouses and children from five Muslim-majority countries. The [dismantling](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/daca-hurricane-irma-and-young-americans-dreams-deferred) of the Obama-era executive order [Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/daca), or *DACA*{:.small}, has left eight hundred thousand Dreamers, some of them heads of households, in personal and financial limbo.

Haitians were the only ones solely identified by nationality,\nin part because of twenty or so Haitian patients who’d shown up at\nJackson Memorial Hospital, in Miami. “We forwarded these cases to the\nC.D.C.,” Dr. Arthur Fournier, who treated some of those first Haitian\npatients, told me recently. “The media then took off with the\nsensationalistic headlines.” Suddenly, every Haitian was suspected of\nhaving *AIDS*{:.small}. At the junior high school I attended, in Brooklyn, some of\nthe non-Haitian students would regularly shove and hit me and the other\nHaitian kids, telling us that we had dirty blood. My English as a Second\nLanguage class was excluded from a school trip to the Statue of Liberty\nout of fear that our sharing a school bus with the other kids might\nprove dangerous to them.\n\nLast week, as many Haitians and Haitian-Americans were preparing for the\nChristmas holidays—some burdened by the fear that they or their loved\nones might be deported in a year’s time because of the Trump Administration’s decision to [end Temporary Protected Status](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/20/us/haitians-temporary-status.html) (T.P.S.)—a  [*Times* article](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/23/us/politics/trump-immigration.html) about President Trump’s anti-immigrant efforts brought back these\nmemories and more. The article described a meeting that took place at\nthe White House in June, when Trump expressed outrage that, in spite of\nhis contested January, 2017, executive order barring refugees,\nparticularly those from seven predominantly Muslim countries, too many\nimmigrants had been granted visas to enter the United States. According\nto the *Times*, Trump was angry that fifteen thousand Haitians were\namong them. They “all have *AIDS*{:.small},” he allegedly said.\n\nWe are used to Trump insulting people of color with callous or racist\nremarks. He has referred to Mexicans as criminals and rapists and, in\nthe June meeting described in the *Times*, Trump reportedly also\ncomplained that forty thousand Nigerian visa recipients would never “go\nback to their huts,” while branding Afghanistan a terrorist haven. (The\nWhite House has denied that Trump denigrated immigrant groups during the\nmeeting.) Still, Trump’s alleged remark about Haiti and *AIDS*{:.small} cut deep,\nreopening a painful wound that goes back several decades.\n\n“It was a dark period in our history as black refugees from the first\nindependent nation in the Western Hemisphere,” Marleine Bastien, the\nexecutive director of the nonprofit organization Haitian Women of Miami,\nrecalled. “I was working as a medical social worker at the time, and\nevery week I saw patients who lost jobs as a result of this. Being called\n‘Haitian’ was the worst possible curse.”\n\nTaina Bien-Aimé, the executive director of the New York-based Coalition\nAgainst Trafficking in Women, was born in New York City to Haitian\nparents who’d immigrated to the U.S. in the nineteen-fifties. She\nrecalled that, in the eighties, a friend of hers used a manager’s pen\nwhile filling out some financial documents at a bank. When her friend\nwas done, the bank manager, who’d learned that her friend was Haitian,\ntook the pen back with a tissue, then threw it in the garbage. “You never\nknow,” he said.\n\nThe linguist Michel DeGraff, who is currently the director of the\nM.I.T.-Haiti Initiative, came to New York, as a student, in the early\neighties. “I still remember a particularly traumatic moment when I was\nbeing introduced to a female student that I had a crush on. She refused\nto shake my hands. Then I overheard her say to another fellow-student,\n‘Better stay away from these Haitians so we don't catch *AIDS*{:.small}.’ ”\n\nAt the height of the *AIDS*{:.small} crisis, the Food and Drug Administration [banned Haitians from donating blood](http://www.nytimes.com/1990/03/14/us/now-no-haitians-can-donate-blood.html).\nNicole Rosefort, a retired New York City public-school teacher, recalls\nher father being sick in the hospital and desperately needing a blood\ntransfusion. “When my sister and I went to donate, we were turned\naway. We couldn't give blood for our own father.”\n\nHaitians mobilized against the ban, protesting in large numbers in\nWashington, Boston, and Miami. The activism culminated on April 20,\n1990, when between fifty thousand and eighty thousand people [marched](http://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/21/nyregion/fda-policy-to-limit-blood-is-protested.html) across the Brooklyn Bridge to denounce the ban and the stigmatization\nand discrimination connected to it. I was twenty-one years old and a\nrecent college graduate at the time. My family and I took part in the\nmarch, along with nearly everyone we knew. We felt the bridge shake that\nday, as if from the weight of our humiliation and rage.\n\nThe blood-donation ban was eventually lifted, but the stigma against\nHaitians lingered, and occasionally resurfaced in popular culture. In\nthe film “How Stella Got Her Groove Back,” from 1998, one of the main\ncharacter’s sisters scolds her for having unprotected sex with a\nJamaican man because “these people have a history of *AIDS*{:.small}.” Another\nsister corrects her: “That’s Haiti, Miss Manners.” In December of 2010,\ndecades after many initial misconceptions about the transmission and\nspread of H.I.V. and *AIDS*{:.small} had been debunked, a popular New York radio d.j. [declared](http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/hot-97-dj-cipha-sounds-apologizes-avoids-hiv-not-hooking-haitian-women-article-1.473327) on air that the reason he was H.I.V.-negative was that he refrained from having sex with Haitian women.\n\nPresident Trump’s alleged remarks have taken many of us back to a time\nwhen such attitudes were commonplace. They are also particularly\ndisturbing in the context of his larger anti-immigrant program. As\nHaitian-community advocates are trying to rally support in Congress and\nelsewhere to find a permanent solution for T.P.S. recipients and their\nfamilies, we are reminded of a time when all H.I.V.-positive immigrants\nwere banned from entering the United States, and H.I.V.-positive\nHaitians were detained, in deplorable conditions, at [Guantánamo\nBay](http://blog.gitmomemory.org/2012/04/10/hiv-positive-haitians-at-guantanamo-bay/).\nTrump’s alleged statement re-stigmatizes both Haitians and people living\nwith H.I.V./*AIDS*{:.small} by pegging them as undesirables. Will the next travel\nban be a medical one?\n\nIf there is a positive side to these alleged remarks, it’s that they\nhave the potential to galvanize. Patricia Lespinasse, an assistant professor of African-American and African Diaspora Literature at\nBinghamton University, is the co-director of a documentary film, “Proud\nBlood,” that focusses on Haitians’ mobilization around the\nblood-donation ban. Lespinasse was eleven years old when her father, an\naccountant at a Wall Street bank, left work to attend the march, and\nthen told her stories about it. While gathering recollections from the\nmarch organizers, activists, and other demonstrators, Lespinasse came to\nsee the march and the eventual lift of the ban as a triumph against\nprejudice. “Much like back in the nineteen-eighties and nineties, when\nthis stereotype was first espoused, we should take this opportunity with\nwhat the President has allegedly said to educate a new generation,” she\nsaid.\n\nAmong the many signs I recall seeing at the march on the Brooklyn\nBridge, back in April, 1990, was one that read, “We are all living with\n*AIDS*{:.small}”—not because we belong to an arbitrarily assigned high-risk group,\nor came from a certain country, but because we are all human. As\nLespinasse put it, “It was Haitians then, but tomorrow it could be any\nother group.”","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"sections":[{"id":"590a02541c7a8e33fb390be1","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News Desk","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news-desk"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"590a00e2c14b3c606c109ee7","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"","canonicalUrl":"http://www.newyorker.com/contributors/edwidge-danticat","email":"","name":"Edwidge Danticat","socialMedia":[],"title":"Edwidge Danticat is the author of many books, including, most recently, “[The Art of Death: Writing the Final Story](https://www.amazon.com/Art-Death-Writing-Final-Story/dp/1555977774).”"}]},"dek":"","hed":"Trump Reopens an Old Wound for Haitians","inlineEmbeds":[],"issueDate":"","ledeCaption":"","modifiedAt":"2018-01-02T22:01:06.367Z","photos":{"tout":[{"id":"5a4bb1669338d356608b925f","modelName":"photo","collection":"photos","aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":2000,"height":1311,"format":"JPEG","duration":null,"url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/tny-services/production/2018/01/02/5a4bb1669338d356608b925e_Danticat-Trump-Reopens-Old-Wound-for-Haitians-2.jpg"},"2:2":{"override":false,"height":1311,"width":1311,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":1311,"width":1311,"x":344.5,"y":0}},"duration":null},"16:9":{"override":false,"height":1125,"width":2000,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":1125,"width":2000,"x":0,"y":0}},"duration":null},"4:3":{"override":false,"height":1311,"width":1748,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":1311,"width":1748,"x":126,"y":0}},"duration":null},"1:1":{"override":false,"height":1311,"width":1311,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":1311,"width":1311,"x":344.5,"y":0}},"duration":null}},"caption":"In 1990, demonstrators protested a ban on blood donations from people of Haitian and sub-Saharan African origin.

It was, in seven hundred words, poignant and personal and epically appropriate, considering his fate. “The Arab world was ripe with hope during the spring of 2011\\. Journalists, academics and the general population were brimming with expectations of a bright and free Arab society within their respective countries,” he [opined](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/global-opinions/jamal-khashoggi-what-the-arab-world-needs-most-is-free-expression/2018/10/17/adfc8c44-d21d-11e8-8c22-fa2ef74bd6d6_story.html?noredirect=on&utm_term=.167d8ec8d487). “They expected to be emancipated from the hegemony of their governments and the consistent interventions and censorship of information.” Instead, rulers grew ever more repressive after the short-lived [Arab Spring](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/arab-spring).\n\nToday, hundreds of millions of people across the Middle East “are unable to adequately address, much less publicly discuss, matters that affect the region and their day-to-day lives,” Khashoggi wrote. They are either “uninformed or misinformed” by draconian censorship and fake state narratives. As the headline of his last published words asserted, “What the Arab world needs most is free expression.”\n\nIn his death, Khashoggi, a Saudi journalist and former government supporter who became a vocal and fearless critic of the current [Saudi crown prince](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/04/09/a-saudi-princes-quest-to-remake-the-middle-east), has galvanized global attention far more than he was able to do during his life. The horrific details of his murder and dismemberment have had an effect he would never have imagined—putting into serious question the fate of a Saudi leader, the state of U.S.-Saudi relations, American foreign-policy goals in the world’s most volatile region, and even policies that have kept dictators in power. The repercussions are only beginning.\n\nBut Khashoggi was hardly a lone voice decrying political repression in the Middle East, as he acknowledged in his final *Post* column. Saudi Arabia may be the most cruel and ruthless government in the region, but it uses tactics embraced by dictators, sheikhs, and Presidents across twenty-two countries.\n\nIn 2014, Egypt’s military-dominated government seized all print copies of the newspaper *Al-Masry Al-Youm*, whose name means “The Egyptian Today.” *Al-Masry Al-Youm* is that rare private newspaper in the Arab world where young reporters once dared to question government policies in hard-hitting editorials and groundbreaking journalism. “The Egyptian government’s seizure of the entire print run of a newspaper, *al-Masry al Youm*, did not enrage or provoke a reaction from colleagues. These actions no longer carry the consequence of a backlash from the international community,” Khashoggi wrote. “Instead, these actions may trigger condemnation quickly followed by silence.” \n\nThe world, particularly the West, is partly culpable for looking the other way, he wrote. It is a tragic irony that the world is paying attention to Khashoggi’s death, yet still not making an issue of a sweeping problem that could determine the future of a region of twenty-two countries and four hundred million people. On Thursday, the U.S. Treasury Secretary, Steve Mnuchin, announced that he would not attend the Saudi investment conference known as “Davos in the Desert,” which is pivotal to the crown prince’s plans to modernize the kingdom’s oil-reliant economy. The British trade minister, the French and Dutch finance ministers, and the president of the International Monetary Fund also backed out after Khashoggi’s disappearance. But no foreign government is addressing the broader political practices in any other country, or any other case, in the region.\n\nIn his column, Khashoggi drew attention to imprisoned colleagues who receive no coverage. “My dear friend, the prominent Saudi writer Saleh al-Shehi, wrote one of the most famous columns ever published in the Saudi press,” Khashoggi noted. “He unfortunately is now serving an unwarranted five-year prison sentence for supposed comments contrary to the Saudi establishment.” Shehi, who had more than a million [followers](https://www.ft.com/content/3c597510-0cee-11e8-839d-41ca06376bf2) on Twitter, was [charged](https://www.alaraby.co.uk/english/news/2018/2/8/saudi-columnist-jailed-for-insulting-the-royal-court) with “insulting the royal court” for his statements about widespread government corruption in his columns for the newspaper *Al Watan* and on a local television program.\n\nMichael Abramowitz, the president of Freedom House and a former national editor at the Washington *Post*, told me that Khashoggi rightly identified the broader stakes. “Khashoggi’s final column accurately pinpointed the appalling lack of political rights and civil liberties in much of the Arab world, especially the right to freely express oneself,” he said. Khashoggi began his last piece by citing Freedom House’s 2018 report—and the fact that only one Arab country, Tunisia, is ranked as “free.” Abramowitz told me, “What is especially sad is that, while we are properly focussed on the outrageous actions by the Saudi government to silence one critic, we must also remember that countless other bloggers, journalists, and writers have been jailed, censored, physically threatened, and even murdered—with little notice from the rest of the world. And, in some cases, notably Egypt, conditions have deteriorated.”\n\nIn the Gulf states, Human Rights Watch [chronicled](https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/11/01/arab-gulf-states-attempts-silence-140-characters) a hundred and forty cases—a number chosen based on the original character limit on Twitter, though there are actually many, many more—where governments have silenced peaceful critics simply for their online activism. Among the most famous is Raif Badawi, a young Saudi blogger who ran a Web site called the Saudi Liberal Network that dared to discuss the country’s rigid Islamic restrictions on culture. One post mocked the prohibition against observing Valentine’s Day, which, like all non-Muslim holidays, is banned in Saudi Arabia. In 2014, he was sentenced to ten years in prison, a thousand lashes, and a fine that exceeded a quarter million dollars. (I wrote about his case [in 2015](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/saudi-whipping).)\n\nBadawi’s sister Samar—who received the 2012 International Women of Courage Award at a White House ceremony hosted by Michelle Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton—was [arrested](https://globalnews.ca/news/4367523/raif-badawis-sister-arrested-in-saudi-arabia-amnesty-international/) in July. When the Canadian Foreign Minister, Chrystia Freeland, tweeted her concern about the Badawi siblings, in August, the kingdom responded by expelling the Canadian Ambassador, recalling its envoy, freezing all new trade and investment, suspending flights by the state airline to Toronto, and ordering thousands of Saudi students to leave Canada. (I wrote about the episode [that month](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/saudi-arabias-crown-prince-picks-a-very-strange-fight-with-canada).)\n\nIn Bahrain, Nabeel Rajab, one of the Arab world’s most prominent human-rights advocates, is languishing in jail after being sentenced to five years for tweeting about torture in the tiny sheikhdom and criticizing Saudi Arabia’s war in Yemen. In the United Arab Emirates, Ahmed Mansoor, who ran a Web site focussed on reforms, was sentenced to ten years for social-media comments calling for reform.\n\n“The Arab people are desperate for real news and information, and Arab governments are desperately trying to make sure they never get that,” Sarah Leah Whitson, the executive director of Human Rights Watch’s Middle East and North Africa division, told me. “Uncensored communication on social media promised journalists and writers in the Middle East the greatest hope to freely exchange ideas and information, but it’s also why Arab governments, so terrified of the voices of their own citizens, rushed to pass laws criminalizing online communications and jailing writers and activists for mere tweets.”\n\nThe wider world bought into the Saudi narrative that [Mohammed bin Salman](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/mohammed-bin-salman), the crown prince and de-facto ruler, was intent on opening up the kingdom. Perhaps tellingly, it is the free press elsewhere in the world that first asked questions about Khashoggi’s October 2nd disappearance, in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, where he had gone to get papers so he could marry. “The world should take note that it is the free press, not the Saudi government or the White House, that has doggedly searched for the truth about what happened to Mr. Khashoggi,” the Democratic senator Patrick Leahy, of Vermont, said in a [statement](https://www.leahy.senate.gov/press/101718khashoggistatement). “It reminds us, once again, that a free press is an essential check against tyranny, dishonesty, and impunity.”\n","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"sections":[{"id":"590a02541c7a8e33fb390be1","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"590a02541c7a8e33fb390be1","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News Desk","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news-desk"},{"id":"5904126172dadf5d0a508800","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news"},{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"}],"name":"News Desk","parent":[{"id":"5904126172dadf5d0a508800","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"},"slug":"news-desk"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"web","contributors":[{"id":"5910a8a54e65be2f29d55eb2","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Robin Wright has been a contributing writer to *The New Yorker* since\n1988.

The meetings seemed jovial. America’s top diplomat and the crown prince laughed together during a photo opportunity, a striking display of camaraderie amid increasingly gruesome stories about Khashoggi’s death—and reported dismemberment—in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. In yet another [bizarre twist](https://www.businessinsider.com/turkeys-erdogan-says-saudi-consulate-freshly-painted-after-khashoggi-case-trump-pompeo-2018-10), the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said, on Tuesday, that surfaces in the consulate had been repainted shortly after Khashoggi disappeared.\n\nIn Riyadh, the crown prince tried to paper over the crisis. “We are strong and old allies,” he [told](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/pompeo-arrives-in-riyadh-for-talks-on-saudi-journalists-fate/2018/10/16/8e1bcb54-d0d5-11e8-a4db-184311d27129_story.html?noredirect=on&utm_term=.11aade426e78) Pompeo, with reporters as witnesses. “We face our challenges together—the past, the day of, tomorrow.”\n\n“Absolutely,” Pompeo replied.\n\nPresident Trump seems ready, even eager, to embrace the Saudi version of events—or at least the kingdom’s pledge to investigate the saga, after it abruptly abandoned its claim that Khashoggi had exited the consulate alive. He condemned criticism of the monarchy. “Here you go again with ‘You’re guilty until proven innocent,’” he told the Associated Press in an interview. “I don't like that. We just went through that with Justice Kavanaugh and he was innocent all the way as far as I'm concerned. So we have to find out what happened.\"\n\nIn an e-mail statement, Pompeo thanked the king for “Saudi Arabia’s strong partnership with the United States.” “My assessment from these meetings is that there is serious commitment to determine all the facts and ensure accountability, including accountability for Saudi Arabia’s senior leaders or senior officials.”\n\nThe Administration’s apparent willingness to accept the Saudi excuse—purportedly that Khashoggi died in a rogue operation—is being widely scorned.\n\n“Hogwash,” Bruce Riedel, a career U.S. intelligence analyst and the author of “[Kings and Presidents: Saudi Arabia and the United States since FDR,](https://www.amazon.com/Kings-Presidents-Arabia-Geopolitics-Century/dp/081573137X)” told me. “The members of the interrogation-murder squad included several members of the Royal Guard, which is a regiment under the personal command of the crown prince. They don’t do anything without his direct oversight and approval. The notion that this is a rogue operation is preposterous.”\n\n“I don’t think it’s going to work,” he added. “It may pass muster with Trump but not with the Washington *Post*.” \n\nTurkish officials claim that fifteen Saudi officials, including a forensic expert, flew to Istanbul on two private jets on October 2nd, the day Khashoggi disappeared, and flew out after spending a few hours at the consulate and the consul’s residence. Four of the fifteen were close to the Saudi crown prince, the *Times* reported, on Tuesday. One of the men, Maher Abdulaziz Mutreb, was photographed with M.B.S. during his U.S. tour, and in Paris and Madrid this spring. After nine hours of searching the consulate Monday, Turkey said it will also search the consul’s residence for “toxic materials.”\n\nThe kingdom,  and in particular the crown prince, who is known as M.B.S., after his initials, is beginning to pay a price—in public relations if not yet in practice. “I’m not going back to Saudi Arabia as long as this guy is in charge,” Lindsey Graham, the South Carolina Republican, [said](https://www.nationalreview.com/news/lindsay-graham-im-going-to-sanction-the-hell-out-of-saudi-arabia/) on “Fox and Friends,” on Tuesday. “I’ve been their biggest defender on the floor of the United States Senate. This guy is a wrecking ball.” Graham said nothing happens in Saudi Arabia without M.B.S.’s knowledge. “He had [Khashoggi] murdered in a consulate in Turkey and to expect me to ignore it, I feel used and abused. The M.B.S. figure is to me toxic. He can never be a world leader on the world stage.” Pressed on what the U.S. should do about the alleged killing of a journalist by a long-standing ally, Graham said he intends to lead an effort in the Senate to “sanction the hell out of Saudi Arabia.”            \n\nTrump is now on the defensive about his ties to the desert kingdom, which date back more than two decades in various business deals. The Saudis are also now central to his foreign policy. On Tuesday, Trump tweeted, “For the record, I have no financial interests in Saudi Arabia (or Russia, for that matter). Any suggestion that I have is just more *FAKE NEWS*{:.small} (of which there is plenty)!” Three years ago, as he announced his candidacy, Trump [boasted](https://www.apnews.com/cafffbc8448e49329e04ef7941c2b85a), “Saudi Arabia, I get along with all of them. They buy apartments from me. They spend forty million dollars, fifty million dollars. Am I supposed to dislike them? I like them very much.\"\n\nBut other Republicans are scathing over Saudi Arabia’s explanation, delivered long after the fact. “Where’s the body?” Florida Senator Marco Rubio, a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, [asked](https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/411576-rubio-raises-questions-about-saudi-defense-in-khashoggis-disappearance-wheres) on CNN. “Why not notify the family? Why have they spent the better part of eight or nine days saying you didn’t know anything about it?” He described the bungling as a “catastrophe” for the Saudis—with rippling repercussions for the Trump Administration. “This would really blow apart our Middle Eastern strategy, and it’s something we have to address from a human-rights standpoint,\" Rubio said. “Just because a country we’re working with did it doesn't mean the United States can just shrug its shoulders and say ‘nothing happened here.’&nbsp;”\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin faces growing pressure to back out of M.B.S.’s annual investment conference this month—billed as “Davos in the Desert”—to signal U.S. alarm. “America’s basic and fundamental values demand a suspension of arms sales to Saudi Arabia,” the Indiana Republican Todd Young, another member of the Foreign Relations Committee, tweeted on Tuesday. “I continue to believe that Secretary Mnuchin should not attend the investment conference in Riyadh next week.” Several big [names](https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/14/business/jamie-dimon-saudi-arabia-future-investment-initiative/index.html) in technology, business, and finance have withdrawn, including J.P. Morgan Chase, Ford, Mastercard, and Blackrock.\n\nThe Saudis again tried to downplay the setbacks. “Whilst it is disappointing that some speakers and partners have pulled out, we are looking forward to welcoming thousands of speakers, moderators and guests from all over the world to Riyadh from October 23 to 25,” a spokesperson for the Future Investment Initiative conference said in a [statement](https://www.reuters.com/article/saudi-politics-dissident-conference-stat/saudi-investment-conference-to-proceed-despite-pullout-of-some-speakers-partners-spokesperson-idUSL8N1WS52T).\n\nThe crisis is generating domestic political fallout too, with the midterm elections approaching. On the Hill, Democrats chastised the President for broadcasting the Saudi version of events, which he first mentioned out of the blue to reporters, on Monday. “Been hearing the ridiculous ‘rogue killers’ theory was where the Saudis would go with this,” the Connecticut Democrat Christopher Murphy, another member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, tweeted. “Absolutely extraordinary they were able to enlist the President of the United States as their PR agent to float it.”\n\nYet the full story still seemed elusive after Pompeo’s hastily organized trip to the kingdom. All he got were some vague promises about finding justice in a country famed for abuses of its citizens, long before Jamal Khashoggi’s disappearance.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"sections":[{"id":"590a02541c7a8e33fb390be1","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News Desk","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news-desk"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5910a8a54e65be2f29d55eb2","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Robin Wright has been a contributing writer to *The New Yorker* since\n1988.

The Saudi press posted photos of Bezos in an open-necked shirt and the prince, having shed his Saudi robes, in a Western suit and dark-red tie. Both men beamed as they talked business and investment opportunities. Bezos was among the prosperous and powerful Americans who met the crown prince during a three-week [road show](https://www.chron.com/business/article/Saudi-crown-prince-wraps-up-U-S-tour-in-Houston-12815405.php), which took him from Harvard to Hollywood and Houston. Along the way, the crown prince also schmoozed with Oprah Winfrey, Bill Gates, both former Presidents Bush, former President Bill Clinton, Kobe Bryant, Michael Bloomberg, Morgan Freeman, Henry Kissinger, Dwayne (the Rock) Johnson, and Richard Branson, among others. He wooed Google, Apple, Disney, Lockheed, Snapchat, and AMC.\n\nDuring Prince Mohammed’s stop in Washington, where he brokered billions of dollars in arms deals, [President Trump](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump) said that Washington’s relationship with the House of Saud was “probably as good as it’s really ever been, and I think will probably only get better.” At each stop, M.B.S., as he’s widely known at home, was heralded as a reformer in one of the world’s most authoritarian states—and possibly even the face of the future Middle East.\n\nThe bizarre disappearance of the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi has abruptly transformed the image of the desert kingdom and its crown prince, who has become its de-facto leader since his appointment, in June, 2017. On Sunday, the Washington *Post*, which Bezos owns, ran a full-page ad with a picture of the consulate’s front door. “On Tuesday, October 2 at 1:14 p.m. Washington *Post* columnist Jamal Khashoggi entered the Consulate of Saudi Arabia,” it read, at the top. “He has not been seen since. *DEMAND ANSWERS*{:.small},” it said at the bottom.\n\nKhashoggi may have accomplished in his disappearance—and possible death—what he had tried to do for the past year from exile, in Washington: hold the kingdom, and specifically its reckless crown prince, accountable for its misdeeds. The grisly prospect that he was dismembered by a hit squad dispatched from [Saudi Arabia](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/saudi-arabia), as Turkish officials have reported, has revolted some of those who just months ago competed to fête M.B.S.\n\n“In his early days, the crown prince was gaining a public image, in significant circles of U.S. public opinion, as a radically different leader from the conservative elderly monarchs of Saudi yore,” Paul Salem, the acting president of the Middle East Institute, told me. “But a darker narrative was also gaining ground, based on his arrest of women activists, business leaders, and silencing critics. The Khashoggi affair has solidified the negative narrative in wide cross-sections of U.S. public opinion.” \n\nTrump’s response has been mixed. On CBS’s “60 Minutes” on Sunday, the President pledged “severe punishment” of Saudi Arabia if it is found responsible for Khashoggi’s abduction or death. “There’s something really terrible and disgusting about that, if that was the case, so we’re going to have to see,” he told Lesley Stahl. “It’s being looked at very, very strongly. And we would be very upset and angry if that were the case. As of this moment, they deny it, and they deny it vehemently. Could it be them? Yes.” He vowed that the United States is “going to get to the bottom of it, and there will be severe punishment.” On Saturday, though, Trump said he would not pull out of billions in arms deals with the kingdom. “It’s the best equipment in the world, but, if they don’t buy it from us, they’re going to buy it from Russia or they’re going to buy it from China or they’re going to buy it from other countries,” he [said](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/411271-trump-defends-110-billion-us-arms-sale-to-saudi-arabia). \n\nTrump has long had close business ties with the Saudis, beginning in the nineteen-nineties. When his real-estate business was in trouble, he sold his yacht and a stake in the Plaza Hotel to a Saudi royal. He also sold Manhattan real estate to Saudi investors and, before becoming President, explored opening a hotel in the port city of Jeddah. Since Trump took office, Saudi Arabia has been the central player in his foreign policy. His first stop on his first foreign tour as President was in its capital city, Riyadh, where he was fêted with pomp and ceremony. His son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner, has developed particularly close ties with M.B.S. and personally promoted him as a reliable American partner in the region. \n\nOn Monday, Trump told reporters that he has spoken with King Salman, who “firmly denied any knowledge” about Khashoggi’s disappearance. (The kingdom also initially denied that Saudi citizens had anything to do with the September 11th attacks, blaming an Israeli intelligence plot.) For the first time, Trump offered an alternative possibility that “rogue killers” were linked to the reported murder. In a tweet, [the President announced](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1051814214212485120) that he is dispatching Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to Riyadh for talks, although the visit appears designed to smooth over tensions, which escalated in heated rhetoric from both sides over the weekend, rather than get to the bottom of the Khashoggi case.\n\nCongress may have other ideas. Since Khashoggi’s disappearance, Republicans and Democrats alike have turned on Saudi Arabia, which spends lavishly on a sophisticated public-relations campaign in the United States. “If this is proven to be true, there is going to be a response from Congress,” the Florida Republican Marco Rubio, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “It’s going to be nearly unanimous, it’s going to be swift, and it’s going to go pretty far.”\n\nRubio said that deferring to the kingdom would effectively give a green light to other dictators. “Our ability to call Putin a murderer, because he is; our ability to call Assad a murderer, because he is; our ability to confront Maduro in Venezuela or any of these other human-rights atrocities like what we see in China—all of that is undermined and compromised if we somehow decide that, because an ally who was important did that, we are not going to call it out.”\n\nLast week, a bipartisan group of twenty-two senators—eleven Republicans and eleven Democrats—invoked the [Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2018/10/12/what-is-the-global-magnitsky-act-and-why-are-u-s-senators-invoking-this-on-saudi-arabia/) in a letter calling on the White House to investigate Khashoggi’s disappearance. The law, passed in 2016 and named for a Russian whistle-blower who died in detention, calls for the United States to impose sanctions on human-rights violators in any country. It stipulates that action should be taken within four months. “A bill to block arms sales to Saudi Arabia was only narrowly defeated last year,” Salem told me. “The Senate might become a no-vote on Saudi issues for some time forward.”\n\nThe revulsion—and questioning of both M.B.S. and his country—is spreading internationally. On Sunday, Britain, France, and Germany, the three most powerful European governments, issued a joint [statement](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/joint-statement-on-the-disappearance-of-jamal-khashoggi-by-foreign-ministers-from-the-uk-france-and-germany) expressing “grave concern” about Khashoggi’s fate. They demanded a “credible investigation” that will “provide a complete and detailed response.”\n\nAlmost two weeks after Khashoggi disappeared, Saudi Arabia has still provided little insight into the case beyond blanket denials. On Sunday, it issued another one—with no name or office attached to it—threatening countermeasures if any government acts against it. “The kingdom affirms its total rejection of any threats and attempts to undermine it, whether by threatening to impose economic sanctions, using political pressures, or repeating false accusations,” it said. “The Kingdom also affirms that if it receives any action, it will respond with greater action.”\n\nM.B.S., who controls the five major levers of power within the royal family, has reacted rashly before. In August, Saudi Arabia [expelled](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/saudi-arabias-crown-prince-picks-a-very-strange-fight-with-canada) the Canadian Ambassador, froze all new trade, suspended flights, and recalled all Saudi students in Canada after its foreign minister tweeted about the case of siblings in the Badawi family, both human-rights activists. In November, the kingdom summoned the Lebanese Prime Minister, Saad Hariri, and ordered him to resign on Saudi state television. He remained under virtual house arrest for two weeks. He was freed to return home—and resume office—only after the U.S. and Europe intervened. And the Saudi war on Yemen, launched shortly after M.B.S. became defense minister, in 2015, has produced the world’s gravest humanitarian crisis, with no end in sight.\n\nThe Saudi public is clearly unsettled by the international furor. The Saudi stock market [plunged](http://apnews.com/fccc0ed10f3842acb8b8dd3447a79b69) by almost seven per cent when it opened on Sunday. It may have been rattled partly by the big names in U.S. business, technology, and energy that have either severed their ties with the kingdom or dropped out of a [conference](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/13/world/middleeast/saudi-arabia-conference-crown-prince-mohammed.html) later this month—billed as “Davos in the Desert”—that is pivotal to lure investment for M.B.S.’s ambitious plan to diversify the kingdom’s oil-reliant economy. Uber and Viacom dropped out of the conference, as did the tech investor Steve Case. The Harbor Group, which reportedly made millions lobbying for the Saudis, [terminated](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2018/10/12/western-walkout-saudi-davos-desert-conference-over-jamal-khashoggi-undermines-kingdoms-modernization-plans/) the relationship.\n\nBranson, who hosted the crown prince last spring in the California desert, issued a scathing statement on Thursday. “What has reportedly happened in Turkey around the disappearance of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, if proved true, would clearly change the ability of any of us in the West to do business with the Saudi Government,” he [wrote](https://www.virgin.com/richard-branson/my-statement-kingdom-saudi-arabia) in a blog post. \n\nRelations between Washington and Riyadh have been this strained only twice before: in 2001, fifteen of the nineteen hijackers who flew planes into the World Trade Center, in New York, and the Pentagon, in Washington, were identified as Saudi. And, in 1973, Saudi Arabia was a key part of the oil boycott on the United States, after Washington supported Israel during the fourth Middle East war. \n\nOne of the ironies of the Khashoggi affair is that he is not even an American citizen. He took up residency in Washington after he opted for exile in mid-2017. But the rippling impact during the past two weeks has been sweeping—with more to come. “The U.S.-Saudi relationship is going through its most acute crisis since 2001,” Salem told me. “Unless the disappearance and/or murder of Khashoggi is dramatically addressed or redressed, this crisis will greatly and negatively impact the crown prince’s plans for a rapid and globalized takeoff of Saudi economy and society.”\n\n*This post has been updated to include President Trump’s comments on Monday regarding a call with the King of Saudi Arabia.*","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"sections":[{"id":"590a02541c7a8e33fb390be1","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News Desk","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news-desk"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5910a8a54e65be2f29d55eb2","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Robin Wright has been a contributing writer to *The New Yorker* since\n1988.

It seems equally clear that Khashoggi, a Virginia resident and a columnist for the Washington *Post*, was murdered, probably on orders of the Saudi crown prince, [Mohammed bin Salman](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/04/09/a-saudi-princes-quest-to-remake-the-middle-east). The latest evidence pointing to M.B.S.’s direct involvement is the identities of members of the team sent to Istanbul to kill Khashoggi: several of the individuals identified by Turkish officials were part of the Royal Guard, responsible for protecting senior members of the House of Saud. “They answer directly to M.B.S.,’’ Bruce Riedel, a former Middle East specialist for the C.I.A. and National Security Council, told me. \n\nKhashoggi was warm, generous, and funny—and loyal to his principles, like the virtues of open and accountable government. His refusal to compromise his values prompted the Saudi government, in 2016, to silence him, and it led him to conclude, the following year, that he needed to flee to America. I saw Jamal whenever I visited Washington. (Whenever he came to New York, we met at Katz’s Deli for giant reuben sandwiches.) Jamal and I spoke for the last time six days before he vanished. He was writing to tell me about the latest crackdown on the Saudi press, which had led to several reporters being imprisoned. He sent me clips from Saudi newspapers documenting their detention. “I hope you are interested in the story,” Jamal wrote in an e-mail. “Saudi authorities are making a mockery of justice while the world celebrates MBS’ reforms!” \n\nIndeed, if there is any lesson to be learned from this terrible affair, it’s how blind so much of official Washington and the American press were to M.B.S.’s true nature. When the crown prince visited the United States earlier this year, he was fêted in Hollywood and Silicon Valley, on Wall Street, and, of course, by the Trump White House, as a messiah—in the mold of Gorbachev or Gandhi. “Historic night it was,’’ Dwayne (the Rock) Johnson, the actor, wrote, on Instagram, of a dinner with M.B.S. hosted by Rupert Murdoch at his vineyard in Bel Air. \n\nIt was the Trump White House that went the furthest, basing its entire Middle East strategy on the vision and maturity of the thirty-three-year-old monarch. As I detailed in [my profile of M.B.S.,](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/04/09/a-saudi-princes-quest-to-remake-the-middle-east) earlier this year, Jared Kushner, sitting down with aides in the White House, unfurled a map of the Middle East shortly after Inauguration Day and wrung his hands at the dire state of the region. He dubbed M.B.S., still the deputy crown prince at the time, “the change agent,” the man who would save Saudi Arabia from otherwise certain doom. Kushner threw the Administration’s support behind him. Not long after, and not least because of the White House’s boost, M.B.S.’s chief rivals, including his cousin, the crown prince, Mohammed bin Nayef, were dispatched. It was ugly, but no one seemed to mind. President Trump’s visit to the Saudi kingdom—his first trip abroad—was an orgy of mutual admiration and monarchical excess. \n\nThe truth is that M.B.S.’s violent, impulsive character was visible early on. First came the tale, told to me by a confidant of the crown prince, of a young M.B.S. trying to force a land-registry official to help him seize a parcel of property. When the official balked, M.B.S. sent a single bullet in an envelope to help change his mind. On the Saudi streets, M.B.S. became known as Abu Rasasa, or “father of the bullet.” \n\nThen, in December, 2017, Saad Hariri, the Prime Minister of Lebanon, was detained in Saudi Arabia and held for eleven hours, according to two former American officials active in the region. “The Saudis put him in a chair, and they slapped him repeatedly,” one of the officials told me. (A spokesperson for Hariri denied that he had been beaten.) M.B.S. was angry at Hariri’s allegedly soft treatment of Hezbollah, the Lebanese armed group, but the strong-arm tactics backfired so spectacularly that Hariri returned to his country as a hero. That same year, M.B.S. and his fellow-like-minded monarch, Mohammed bin Zayed, the crown prince of Abu Dhabi, of the United Arab Emirates, announced a blockade of Qatar, a tiny Gulf state, with the hope of overthrowing its king. The scheme fell apart when American officials forcibly intervened. \n\nThen there was the M.B.S.-led military intervention in Yemen, ostensibly waged by Saudi Arabia and the U.A.E. against their Iranian rivals. Since 2016, the campaign has consisted mainly of indiscriminate bombing with American weapons. The toll so far: at least sixteen thousand civilians killed, widespread famine, and a plague of cholera. \n\nThe most widely publicized display of M.B.S.’s autocratic streak came in November, 2017, when M.B.S. ordered the roundup of as many as five hundred members of the Saudi royal family. Imprisoned in a five-star hotel, princes and other royals were held captive until they signed over substantial shares of their fortunes. Among those detained was Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal, whose holding company owns large shares of many American companies, including Twenty-First Century Fox. No doubt some of those fortunes were obtained unethically, but M.B.S. afforded the accused no due process, no lawyers, no trials. I heard credible reports that at least some of the men held in the Ritz-Carlton were tortured. \n\nM.B.S. told his countrymen that, in cracking down on corruption, he was doing the dirty work on their behalf. But there was no luxury that he denied himself. In 2015, while vacationing in the South of France, he bought a yacht, the Serene, from a Russian vodka tycoon, for five hundred and fifty million dollars. He bought a château west of Paris, with a cinema and a moat with a submerged glass chamber for viewing carp. And, in 2017, he reportedly spent four hundred and fifty million dollars on “Salvator Mundi,’’ the Leonardo da Vinci portrait of Jesus Christ, which he donated to the new branch of the Louvre in Abu Dhabi, the fiefdom of his fellow-prince M.B.Z. \n\nUnquestioned, and even fawned over, by many in the American government and press, M.B.S.’s self-regard swelled to such proportions that he would no longer subject himself to adult examination. When I asked to interview M.B.S. earlier this year, I was refused. Then, when *The New Yorker’s* fact checkers sent the Embassy a list of questions, M.B.S.’s minions reacted angrily to inquiries like the one about the bullet story. My questions, Prince Faisal bin Farhan, an Embassy spokesman, told me, were “very disappointing and certainly justified our instinct not to grant any further access.” \n\nWhich brings us to now. In apparently ordering the grisly killing of a Washington *Post* columnist, M.B.S. wagered that the world would not miss another murdered journalist. So far, he has been spectacularly wrong, and the slow drip of information during the past two weeks—from the Turkish government and American officials—has rendered the denials of M.B.S. and other Saudis preposterous. The latest tale, regurgitated by President Trump—that Khashoggi was killed by government “rogues”—is belied by the evidence: among the fifteen members of the hit team that went to meet Khashoggi in Istanbul was a pathologist with a bone saw. \n\nThe question now confronting Saudi leaders—and American ones—is whether M.B.S. can and should become king. At a glance, it seems unlikely that King Salman would part with M.B.S., long his favorite son. The humiliation for the House of Saud might be too much to endure. Even if Salman were inclined to remove M.B.S. from the line of succession, who could replace him? Nearly all of M.B.S.’s rivals have been imprisoned or humiliated. \n\nYet the crisis caused by the murder of Jamal Khashoggi has brought Saudi-American relations to their lowest point in more than forty years. No cover story—about “rogues,” or an interrogation gone awry—is going to paper over the terrible fact that Khashoggi disappeared into the hands of a team of Saudi officials armed with a bone saw, and that he has not been seen, living or dead, since he walked through the door of the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. No American who values a free press should forget Khashoggi’s murder—or let Prince Mohammed bin Salman forget it, either.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"sections":[{"id":"5907f159ebe912338a3717d7","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Daily Comment","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"daily-comment"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"590c97ed4e65be2f29d5528c","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Dexter Filkins joined _The New Yorker_ as a staff writer in 2011.

The meetings seemed jovial. America’s top diplomat and the crown prince laughed together during a photo opportunity, a striking display of camaraderie amid increasingly gruesome stories about Khashoggi’s death—and reported dismemberment—in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. In yet another [bizarre twist](https://www.businessinsider.com/turkeys-erdogan-says-saudi-consulate-freshly-painted-after-khashoggi-case-trump-pompeo-2018-10), the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said, on Tuesday, that surfaces in the consulate had been repainted shortly after Khashoggi disappeared.\n\nIn Riyadh, the crown prince tried to paper over the crisis. “We are strong and old allies,” he [told](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/pompeo-arrives-in-riyadh-for-talks-on-saudi-journalists-fate/2018/10/16/8e1bcb54-d0d5-11e8-a4db-184311d27129_story.html?noredirect=on&utm_term=.11aade426e78) Pompeo, with reporters as witnesses. “We face our challenges together—the past, the day of, tomorrow.”\n\n“Absolutely,” Pompeo replied.\n\nPresident Trump seems ready, even eager, to embrace the Saudi version of events—or at least the kingdom’s pledge to investigate the saga, after it abruptly abandoned its claim that Khashoggi had exited the consulate alive. He condemned criticism of the monarchy. “Here you go again with ‘You’re guilty until proven innocent,’” he told the Associated Press in an interview. “I don't like that. We just went through that with Justice Kavanaugh and he was innocent all the way as far as I'm concerned. So we have to find out what happened.\"\n\nIn an e-mail statement, Pompeo thanked the king for “Saudi Arabia’s strong partnership with the United States.” “My assessment from these meetings is that there is serious commitment to determine all the facts and ensure accountability, including accountability for Saudi Arabia’s senior leaders or senior officials.”\n\nThe Administration’s apparent willingness to accept the Saudi excuse—purportedly that Khashoggi died in a rogue operation—is being widely scorned.\n\n“Hogwash,” Bruce Riedel, a career U.S. intelligence analyst and the author of “[Kings and Presidents: Saudi Arabia and the United States since FDR,](https://www.amazon.com/Kings-Presidents-Arabia-Geopolitics-Century/dp/081573137X)” told me. “The members of the interrogation-murder squad included several members of the Royal Guard, which is a regiment under the personal command of the crown prince. They don’t do anything without his direct oversight and approval. The notion that this is a rogue operation is preposterous.”\n\n“I don’t think it’s going to work,” he added. “It may pass muster with Trump but not with the Washington *Post*.” \n\nTurkish officials claim that fifteen Saudi officials, including a forensic expert, flew to Istanbul on two private jets on October 2nd, the day Khashoggi disappeared, and flew out after spending a few hours at the consulate and the consul’s residence. Four of the fifteen were close to the Saudi crown prince, the *Times* reported, on Tuesday. One of the men, Maher Abdulaziz Mutreb, was photographed with M.B.S. during his U.S. tour, and in Paris and Madrid this spring. After nine hours of searching the consulate Monday, Turkey said it will also search the consul’s residence for “toxic materials.”\n\nThe kingdom,  and in particular the crown prince, who is known as M.B.S., after his initials, is beginning to pay a price—in public relations if not yet in practice. “I’m not going back to Saudi Arabia as long as this guy is in charge,” Lindsey Graham, the South Carolina Republican, [said](https://www.nationalreview.com/news/lindsay-graham-im-going-to-sanction-the-hell-out-of-saudi-arabia/) on “Fox and Friends,” on Tuesday. “I’ve been their biggest defender on the floor of the United States Senate. This guy is a wrecking ball.” Graham said nothing happens in Saudi Arabia without M.B.S.’s knowledge. “He had [Khashoggi] murdered in a consulate in Turkey and to expect me to ignore it, I feel used and abused. The M.B.S. figure is to me toxic. He can never be a world leader on the world stage.” Pressed on what the U.S. should do about the alleged killing of a journalist by a long-standing ally, Graham said he intends to lead an effort in the Senate to “sanction the hell out of Saudi Arabia.”            \n\nTrump is now on the defensive about his ties to the desert kingdom, which date back more than two decades in various business deals. The Saudis are also now central to his foreign policy. On Tuesday, Trump tweeted, “For the record, I have no financial interests in Saudi Arabia (or Russia, for that matter). Any suggestion that I have is just more *FAKE NEWS*{:.small} (of which there is plenty)!” Three years ago, as he announced his candidacy, Trump [boasted](https://www.apnews.com/cafffbc8448e49329e04ef7941c2b85a), “Saudi Arabia, I get along with all of them. They buy apartments from me. They spend forty million dollars, fifty million dollars. Am I supposed to dislike them? I like them very much.\"\n\nBut other Republicans are scathing over Saudi Arabia’s explanation, delivered long after the fact. “Where’s the body?” Florida Senator Marco Rubio, a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, [asked](https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/411576-rubio-raises-questions-about-saudi-defense-in-khashoggis-disappearance-wheres) on CNN. “Why not notify the family? Why have they spent the better part of eight or nine days saying you didn’t know anything about it?” He described the bungling as a “catastrophe” for the Saudis—with rippling repercussions for the Trump Administration. “This would really blow apart our Middle Eastern strategy, and it’s something we have to address from a human-rights standpoint,\" Rubio said. “Just because a country we’re working with did it doesn't mean the United States can just shrug its shoulders and say ‘nothing happened here.’&nbsp;”\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin faces growing pressure to back out of M.B.S.’s annual investment conference this month—billed as “Davos in the Desert”—to signal U.S. alarm. “America’s basic and fundamental values demand a suspension of arms sales to Saudi Arabia,” the Indiana Republican Todd Young, another member of the Foreign Relations Committee, tweeted on Tuesday. “I continue to believe that Secretary Mnuchin should not attend the investment conference in Riyadh next week.” Several big [names](https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/14/business/jamie-dimon-saudi-arabia-future-investment-initiative/index.html) in technology, business, and finance have withdrawn, including J.P. Morgan Chase, Ford, Mastercard, and Blackrock.\n\nThe Saudis again tried to downplay the setbacks. “Whilst it is disappointing that some speakers and partners have pulled out, we are looking forward to welcoming thousands of speakers, moderators and guests from all over the world to Riyadh from October 23 to 25,” a spokesperson for the Future Investment Initiative conference said in a [statement](https://www.reuters.com/article/saudi-politics-dissident-conference-stat/saudi-investment-conference-to-proceed-despite-pullout-of-some-speakers-partners-spokesperson-idUSL8N1WS52T).\n\nThe crisis is generating domestic political fallout too, with the midterm elections approaching. On the Hill, Democrats chastised the President for broadcasting the Saudi version of events, which he first mentioned out of the blue to reporters, on Monday. “Been hearing the ridiculous ‘rogue killers’ theory was where the Saudis would go with this,” the Connecticut Democrat Christopher Murphy, another member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, tweeted. “Absolutely extraordinary they were able to enlist the President of the United States as their PR agent to float it.”\n\nYet the full story still seemed elusive after Pompeo’s hastily organized trip to the kingdom. All he got were some vague promises about finding justice in a country famed for abuses of its citizens, long before Jamal Khashoggi’s disappearance.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"sections":[{"id":"590a02541c7a8e33fb390be1","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"590a02541c7a8e33fb390be1","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News Desk","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news-desk"},{"id":"5904126172dadf5d0a508800","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news"},{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"}],"name":"News Desk","parent":[{"id":"5904126172dadf5d0a508800","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"},"slug":"news-desk"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"web","contributors":[{"id":"5910a8a54e65be2f29d55eb2","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Robin Wright has been a contributing writer to *The New Yorker* since\n1988.

The Saudi dissident, a fifty-nine-year-old former editor and government adviser, was convinced that the kingdom’s new leadership wanted to kill him. “Of course they’d like to see me out of the picture,” he said. He’d said it to me before, but by then he had been in exile, in Washington, for more than a year, so I thought he was exaggerating the dangers. Maybe not. Khashoggi hasn’t been seen since he went into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, on Tuesday, to get papers verifying his divorce so that he could remarry. His fiancée, who waited outside for eleven hours, said he never emerged.\t\n\nFive days have passed, with no proof of life, and international human-rights groups now allege that Khashoggi has been abducted. On Sunday, Yasin Aktay, an adviser to Turkish President Tayyip Recep Erdoğan, told Reuters that Turkey believes Khashoggi was murdered in the Saudi consulate, adding that fifteen Saudis were allegedly involved in Khashoggi’s disappearance. Erdoğan told reporters that his government is investigating the event. “Entries and exits into the embassy, airport transits, and all camera records are being looked at and followed,” he told reporters. “We want to swiftly get results.” The U.S. State Department also said it is closely following the case. A Turkish colleague of Khashoggi’s told journalists, on Sunday, that the Turkish government advised him to “make your funeral preparation.” Khashoggi had been killed “in a barbaric way” and then dismembered, Turan Kışlakçı, who heads the Turkish-Arab Media Association, told the Associated Press. Another report claimed that his body had been taken back to Saudi Arabia.\n\nKhashoggi has long been an important voice in the kingdom. I’ve known him for decades. He had been loyal to the royals, and, for many foreign journalists and experts, he was always a good place to start to understand the monarchy’s thinking. Khashoggi served as the editor of the Saudi daily newspaper *Al Watan* and headed a television station. But he became increasingly critical of the government and, in June, 2017, decided to leave. Even in exile, he still influenced the debate about the kingdom’s future, with almost 1.7 million [followers](https://twitter.com/JKhashoggi?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) on Twitter, a Global Opinions [column](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/global-opinions/wp/2018/10/06/read-jamal-khashoggis-columns-for-the-washington-post/?utm_term=.a79fbb0afb3b) in the Washington *Post,* and regular appearances on international television. \n\n The bizarre mystery surrounding Khashoggi’s disappearance is part of a broader trend since the appointment, in June of last year, of the young Saudi crown prince, [Mohammed bin Salman](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/04/09/a-saudi-princes-quest-to-remake-the-middle-east), who is more commonly known by his initials, M.B.S. The thirty-three-year-old has pledged sweeping reforms, but his rule has been increasingly ruthless, with mass arrests of businessmen, and even other princes, and death sentences meted out, this year, to a women’s-rights activist and also to moderate clerics who have preached against extremism. “Above and beyond the persecution of activists, writers, clerics, scholars, and businessmen inside Saudi, where the Saudis could claim some kind of ‘process,’ the apparent kidnapping of Khashoggi is now a pattern of attacks where the Saudis don’t even make a pretense of legality,” Sarah Leah Whitson, the executive director of Human Rights Watch’s Middle East division, told me on Sunday.\n\nThe growing campaign of intimidation, she noted, includes the arrest, in May, of Loujain al-Hathloul, a women’s-rights activist who once ranked third among the Arab world’s hundred most powerful women—even as the kingdom said that it was opening up opportunities for women by allowing them to drive, an issue that Hathloul had championed. Another is what Whitson called the “goonish [assault](https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2Famp%2Famp.albawaba.com%2Fnews%2Fsaudi-human-rights-activist-punched-men-backing-mbs-london-1187358&data=02%7C01%7Cwhitsos%40hrw.org%7C2bea8ce31bd54e27d1ca08d62c453a60%7C2eb79de4d8044273a6e64b3188855f66%7C1%7C0%7C636745073187389660&sdata=ZpPgbgjJptd3yIqp97Jfh2nliVB9sX6VRzDWJaX1uwA%3D&reserved=0)” on Ghanem al-Dosari, who is famed for his satirical YouTube videos criticizing the Saudi royal family, by Saudi agents in London. Three Saudi princes have been abducted since King Salman, M.B.S.’s father, became king, in 2015, the BBC reported. Taken together, Whitson said, all of these acts “reflect the brazen, crude, Qaddafi-like nature of the Saudi crown prince, and, above all, his message to Saudis inside and outside the country: you better shut up. You are not safe. There is no law that can protect you.”\n\nIn an interview with Bloomberg this past Wednesday, the crown prince dismissed reports of Khashoggi’s abduction as unfounded “rumors,” and vowed to probe the case alongside Turkish authorities. “My understanding is he entered and he got out after a few minutes or one hour. I’m not sure,” M.B.S. said. “We are ready to welcome the Turkish government to go and search our premises. The premises are sovereign territory, but we will allow them to enter and search and do whatever they want to do. We have nothing to hide.” \n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\nOn Saturday, four days after Khashoggi’s disappearance, the Saudi consul-general in Istanbul, Mohammed al-Otaibi, took Reuters journalists on a tour of the six-story consulate, opening cupboards and doors to prove that Khashoggi was not there. On Sunday, I e-mailed Adel al-Jubeir, the Saudi foreign minister (and a former neighbor of mine, when he lived in Washington as a young diplomat), asking about Khashoggi’s status. He did not reply.\n\nBut experts on Saudi Arabia suspect a more ominous pattern. “The crocodile tears of the crown prince and other Saudi officials are probably for deception and prevarication,” Bruce Riedel, a former C.I.A., Pentagon, and National Security Council staffer who is now at the Brookings Institution, told me. “The disappearance of Jamal fits with a pattern of crude intimidation and the silencing of criticism and dissent.”\n\nIn words that now haunt his own case, Khashoggi told me, in August, that the crown prince has “no tolerance or willingness to accommodate critics.” Although he is technically next in line to the throne, M.B.S. acts as the country’s de-facto leader, Khashoggi said, and has already become more autocratic than any of the previous six kings who have ruled since the death of Ibn Saud, the founder of modern Saudi Arabia, in 1953.\n\nWhen we spoke last November, Khashoggi compared the Saudi monarchy to the Iranian theocracy. “M.B.S. is now becoming the supreme leader,” he said, a reference to Iran’s top authority, who has veto power over every branch of the government. Since his father became king, in 2015, M.B.S. has consolidated his hold on the five major sectors of power, serving as minister of defense, head of a new economic council, and chief of the royal court. “He is very autocratic and totally illiberal,” Khashoggi told me in August. “I worked for the government for four or five years. I never thought I’d be arrested, but then I thought I might. That’s why I left.” Khashoggi’s status became ever more precarious as his critiques of the monarchy sharpened in recent months.\n\nIn a statement on Sunday, the Washington *Post* called Khashoggi a “committed, courageous journalist.” Fred Hiatt, the *Post’s* editorial-page editor, said, “He writes out of a sense of love for his country and deep faith in human dignity and freedom. We have been enormously proud to publish his writing.” Hiatt called reports of Khashoggi’s murder “a monstrous and unfathomable act.”\n\n[Amnesty International](https://www.amnestyusa.org/press-releases/alleged-assassination-of-jamal-khashoggi-in-saudi-consulate-in-istanbul-would-set-abysmal-new-low/) called reports of Khashoggi’s assassination “an abysmal new low. Such an assassination within the grounds of the consulate, which is territory under Saudi Arabian jurisdiction, would amount to an extrajudicial execution. This case sends a shockwave among Saudi Arabian human rights defenders and dissidents everywhere, eroding any notion of seeking safe haven abroad.” \n\nIn one of his early columns for the *Post*, in September, 2017, Khashoggi said it had taken a long time for him to reach the point of challenging his own government. “It was painful for me several years ago when several friends were arrested. I said nothing. I didn’t want to lose my job or my freedom. I worried about my family,” he wrote. “I have made a different choice now. I have left my home, my family and my job, and I am raising my voice. To do otherwise would betray those who languish in prison. I can speak when so many cannot. I want you to know that Saudi Arabia has not always been as it is now. We Saudis deserve better.” \n\nThey certainly do.

Forecasters had been tracking the storm for nearly a week, and it was growing rapidly. But the Florida Department of Corrections, which oversees the incarceration of almost a hundred thousand people, chose not to evacuate several state prisons, even those that fell within the evacuation zone. On Tuesday, the F.D.C. announced that, “in an abundance of caution,” it had relocated people from six low-security facilities to larger state prisons. Yet some of those prisons were themselves in the path of the storm. One prisoner told his wife, Heather, that he was moved from a low-security facility with only a pillow and a blanket. He was placed in a dormitory at Gulf Correctional Institution, just thirty miles north of [Mexico Beach](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/14/us/hurricane-michael-florida-mexico-beach-house.html).\n\nOn Wednesday morning, with the storm just off the coast, prisoner advocates began to call Florida officials en masse, urging them to change course and undertake a last-minute evacuation. They cited past storms, such as Hurricane Harvey, which flooded prisons and [stranded people in cells](https://www.newyorker.com/sections/news/weathering-a-hurricane-in-prison) without electricity, running water, or adequate food. An hour before Michael made landfall, a woman named Jessica heard from her husband, who was in a men’s dormitory at Gulf C.I. “He said that inmates are restless, and that there’s not a lot of staff,” Jessica told me. He described strong winds and power outages, and said the staff had not boarded the windows. Heather’s husband told her that he’d been placed in a dormitory that had been closed for a year. “He said that water was coming under the door,” she told me. (A state prison spokesperson said, “Inmates were housed in normal dormitories.”)\n\nA woman who is incarcerated at Gadsden Correctional Institution, northwest of Tallahassee, called her daughter, Brittany Wallace. A correctional officer had addressed the large women’s dormitory where she’s housed. “If the roof starts to come off, grab your mat, get under the bed, and we’ll see you when it’s over,” the officer had said, according to Wallace. “It almost felt like she was saying bye, at the end of the phone call,” Wallace told me, her voice breaking. “She wants me to tell everybody—my sisters, her grandson, her husband, everybody that still talks to her—that she loves them.”\n\nHurricane Michael reached the Florida Panhandle just before 2 *P.M.*{: .small} It was the [most powerful storm](https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/09/weather/hurricane-michael-stats-superlatives-wxc-trnd/index.html) to strike the U.S. in half a century. At 2:14 *P.M.*{: .small}, a woman named Melissa Haymon received a message from her son, who is incarcerated at Liberty Work Camp, a low-security facility that was in the path of the storm. “It sounds like a train is circling around the building,” he wrote, using JPay, a for-profit e-mail service for the incarcerated. “You can feel the wind coming in around the plumbing in the bathroom and all the floors are soaking wet.” When he looked outside, he saw pieces of the roof on the ground. He e-mailed again an hour later. “Water is pouring in from the windows still even though they are shut,” he wrote. “The entire dorm is flooding.”\n\nA man at Gulf C.I. called his mother, Melinda Aronson, around the same time. He said that correctional officers had warned everyone that the roof might give way. “They told us to grab our mats and get under the bunk,” he said, according to Aronson. Minutes later, the roof had collapsed. “Mom, it’s really, really bad here,” he told her. Over the phone, she heard men yelling out the names and phone numbers of their loved ones, hoping that she could let them know that they were alive. Tanner Harden, a college student in Alabama, said his father, who works in maintenance at Gulf C.I., called his family. “He told us the prison’s roof was getting ripped off and that they were stuck in the maintenance building,” Harden wrote to me, in a direct message on Twitter. “He said they couldn’t open the doors because they knew the wind would just snatch it off the hinges if they did.” (A journalist for the Florida *Times-Union*, Ben Conarck, first reported damage at the prison.)\n\nBy Wednesday evening, the storm had passed over the Panhandle. At 7:59 *P.M.*{: .small}, the F.D.C. issued a press release on its Facebook page: “All Panhandle institutions have checked in and are secured; *NO*{:.small} reported injuries to staff or inmates. All inmates have access to food and water. Facility by facility damage assessments are being conducted. Some facilities have sustained damage.” Families began to comment on the post, sharing news and asking about specific facilities. Later that night, after many frantic hours in front of her computer, a woman named Teresa Wray decided to create a Facebook group called “Florida Prisons affected by Hurricane Michael.” Her son had spent the storm inside Calhoun Correctional Institution, which also sustained damage, and she had not heard from him. “I was so tired and upset,” Wray wrote to me. “I had to do something.” More than three hundred people, mostly women, eventually joined the group. In thousands of comments, they shared official updates, posted links to news stories, and relayed accounts from loved ones. \n\nMelissa Haymon was one of many mothers who did not hear from her son that night, or the next day. Growing desperate, she tried e-mailing a state prison official. “We have not heard from him since early evening yesterday,” she wrote. “Do they have adequate fresh water supplies? Do they have food to feed them? I can’t find out any information online about the facility. Please, I beg you to send people to help them.” The official did not respond. Haymon couldn’t understand why, in the days before the storm, her son had not been evacuated.\n\n-=-=-=-\n \nEarlier this year, in a fact sheet shared with state legislators, the F.D.C. warned that state prisons were “not adequately funded for the existing inmate population.” The Florida legislature had proposed deep funding cuts, which, the document said, would cause “a public safety issue” by preventing the F.D.C. from upgrading its fleet of vehicles. It also said that a reduced budget “would result in the Department’s inability to provide officer safety equipment, impact routine maintenance on aging infrastructures, and have a direct impact on clothing, hygiene items for inmates.” The legislature made the cuts anyway. Governor Rick Scott, who had argued for F.D.C.-funding increases, signed the budget on March 16th. The reductions took effect in June, and, in a second fact sheet on the approved budget, the prison system described severe $9.4 million cuts from “Expenses, Vehicles, Inmate/Food and Clothing, Electronic Monitoring, etc.”\n\nThe Governor’s office declined to answer questions about the budget cuts and the state’s emergency response, pointing me to the F.D.C. Then Michelle Glady, the F.D.C.’s director of communications, wrote me an e-mail. “The recent budget reductions did not have an impact [on] our hurricane preparedness,” she insisted. But she added that Julie Jones, the head of the state prison system, “is working tirelessly to mitigate the impacts of these cuts.” When I asked who had made the decision not to evacuate, she said, “FDC makes evacuation determinations in the best interest of public, staff, and inmate safety.”\n\nIn the days after the hurricane, families began to get updates from the worst-hit facilities. BuzzFeed [published photographs](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/zahrahirji/this-florida-prison-took-in-evacuated-inmates-then-it-was) of prison roofs that had been torn apart. One woman, whose husband spent the storm in Gulf C.I., saw the pictures and began to pray. “Don’t make me a widow,” the woman, who asked me to call her Debby because she feared retaliation against her husband, remembered thinking. “Part of me thought he was already dead.” Brittany Wallace learned that her mother, at Gadsden C.I., had been spared the worst of the storm. Jessica got a call from her husband, at Gulf C.I., on Thursday. “He said that it was probably the worst night of his life, and that chaos just broke out, and staff didn’t do anything. Staff couldn’t do anything,” she told me. “He said he was one of the lucky dorms, because his roof didn’t completely rip off. But there was a hole in the roof, and they had no power. And the water was not drinkable.”\n\nThe F.D.C. began busing people out of a handful of battered facilities, in shifts that lasted days. (Glady said the prison system had enough working buses, and blamed the slow pace on road conditions.) For security reasons, their destinations were not shared in public databases until after the evacuations had occurred. When families finally spoke to their loved ones, they heard harrowing stories. They also learned that incarcerated people had been forced to abandon what little property they had, including Bibles and legal paperwork. Brian and Cathy, who asked me not to use their last names for fear of retaliation, said that their relatives were not allowed to bring photographs or documents when they left Gulf C.I. Cathy said of her relative, “He has worked hard at the Law Library getting info on his case and now all that is gone.” Melinda Aronson alleged that a correctional officer had told her son, “I don’t give a fuck about your legal paperwork. Get on the bus.” Glady, the F.D.C. spokesperson, said on Monday, “We had to move a lot of inmates quickly. Ensuring the inmates have all their property and legal documents is a current priority.” She added that “teams are currently being deployed” in an effort to recover what was left behind.\n\nAronson first heard from her son on Saturday afternoon, three days after the storm. She was at a birthday party, trying not to feel anxious, when he called; she scribbled on a pack of batteries so that she would remember the details. Then she shared an update in the Facebook group. Her son had been driven past Panama City, where the damage was catastrophic. “Mom, I don’t even know what to think. Places that we lived are gone,” he told her. He had not been able to take a shower or change his clothes since before the storm, he said. Aronson, who is sixty-two and previously worked as a mental-health case manager, worried that prisoners would suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder. Hurricane Michael, she said, exposed a nationwide problem. “This is not the first time that men were left behind,” she said. “Something is wrong. It’s not just Michael—it’s Irma, it’s Maria, it’s Harvey.” After Hurricane Katrina, in 2005, inmates reported that correctional officers abandoned Orleans Parish Prison, in Louisiana, for days, leaving men trapped in flooded cells without food or water.\n\nDebby spoke to her husband on Saturday as well. He had made it through, sleeping on his mattress atop a set of lockers. Melissa Haymon, who had e-mailed with her son on Wednesday, just as the storm reached land, next heard news from him on Sunday. He called his father to say that he had not been injured, and that, despite structural damage and flooding, the F.D.C. had not evacuated the facility. Haymon also belatedly received an e-mail that her son had tried to send on Wednesday, in the midst of the storm. “I love you and miss you,” the message said. “Try not to worry about me.”\n\nAs of Tuesday afternoon, Teresa Wray, who created the Facebook group to share information about the state of Florida prisons, still had not heard from her son.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"sections":[{"id":"590a02541c7a8e33fb390be1","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"590a02541c7a8e33fb390be1","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News Desk","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news-desk"},{"id":"5904126172dadf5d0a508800","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news"},{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"}],"name":"News Desk","parent":[{"id":"5904126172dadf5d0a508800","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"},"slug":"news-desk"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"web","contributors":[{"id":"5910a7a7da97f12ef9160a60","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"","canonicalUrl":"http://www.newyorker.com/contributors/daniel-a-gross","email":"","name":"Daniel A.

He called it Just the Cook, a reference to his pre-restaurant-owning days, when people would come to his house for dinner, and ask him if he was a professional chef. “I’m just the cook,” he’d say.\n\nJust the Cook became a Panama City attraction, a popular spot for crab cakes, fish tacos, and burgers made with two doughnuts instead of a bun. Last week, Hall finished what had been a months-long process of moving his restaurant—a two-story, red-and-white houseboat full of kitchen equipment—to a new location, off the western tip of Panama City, in Saint Andrew Bay. The location included a large pavilion just onshore, where patrons could sit. On Tuesday, with Hurricane Michael heading for the city, Hall moved his restaurant again, anchoring it beside Hathaway Bridge, which connects Panama City to Panama City Beach, in an attempt to give it a better chance of surviving the storm. Later that day, he and his wife and daughter drove four hours north to Wetumpka, Alabama, near Montgomery, where friends of friends had offered them a place to stay. They’ve been there since. Speaking by phone on Friday, Hall, who is fifty-four, described the efforts he made to protect his business from the unprecedented storm, and how he learned of his boat’s fate. This account has been edited and condensed.\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n“We stay on top of weather a lot. Probably Friday or Saturday—we’d already been tracking it—we knew something was happening. My restaurant, we’re closed every Monday. So I said, ‘We’ll be open Sunday, we’ll close up, we’ll start making plans.’ That Sunday evening, we served everybody, sat around drinking a beer with friends. Everything’s calm, sky looks beautiful. And we start making plans on what needs to go where, what goes to storage, what’s going to stay right in place, chained to the pavilion that we have. I’m a U.S. marine, and we’re always pretty prepared for things.\n\n“But then Michael turned into a hurricane, and Monday’s upon us. My boat sits on giant blocks of marine-grade foam, so there’s no taking her out of the water. One of the problems is our gray-water tank—when we’re doing things in the kitchen, all the gray water goes in this fuselage. The fuselage protrudes lower than the foam, and had become lodged in the sand. This just became a huge ordeal, because the boat would not move. Monday we’re out there, four in the morning, waiting for different tides to come through. But she will not move.\n\n“So Tuesday rolls along. I have friends coming out. I had probably ten very large, grown men out there helping me. We had two or three boats at a time pulling on her. She won’t move. I had been patting myself on the back, because, as soon as I had determined, way early in the week, that this thing is going to get bad, we’re getting gas, we’re getting water, we’re doing all the normal supply stuff. But if I can’t move this boat it means nothing. We’re standing in the bay, waves are coming over our head. We’re standing in the water, holding the lines for the boat. And it was just getting more futile and more futile, and I was telling my friend, ‘Just one more try and we’re going to call the ball. Everybody’s got family to take care of.’\n\n“A lot of dangerous things occurred once we were moving her. I couldn’t make it to the boat once the boat got under way, and I had to swim across half the bay—that was probably, in hindsight, really stupid—trying to get back to the boat. Another friend of mine, he had contacted me on Facebook that morning and said, ‘Look, we’re preparing, but I’ll come help if I can.’ And, sure enough, here he comes. Christopher shows up in a twenty-foot Mako with a hundred-and-fifty-horsepower engine on the back. And it was like Captain America to the rescue. Now we’re going in the right direction, the boat’s not going sideways, everything felt good.\n\n“We get underneath the Hathaway Bridge, which was a very calming thing, because all of a sudden the wind stopped, because we’re under this giant structure. But, as soon as we came out the other side of it, the wind’s coming in out of the east. The boat would barely move. Christopher called me to the front of the boat and says, ‘Hey, I don’t know what we’re going to do, because I can’t make any ground.’ So then he decided to take little bites at a time—he would zig-zag—so another hour and a half of zig-zagging took us to where we left the boat. We threw two incredibly heavy chain anchors—we throw those off the bow, we throw the remaining anchors off the stern. Just kind of hoping that she’d bounce around, like sailboats do.\n\n“We have friends we could have stayed with. A friend of ours, his entire bar is a concrete block, and it lasted throughout the storm, he was inviting us to stay there. The house that we were in on Panama City Beach is a two-story condo, and it’s in a definite flood zone. I get there, and my wife was, like, ‘This thing is turning into a four. We’re going.’ I’m grabbing, like, one or two things, and she’s packing bags of clothes, and grabbing important documents. She was the smart one on this. I ended up with two pairs of shorts and two T-shirts, and they ended up with bags of clothes.\n\n“Friends of ours contacted us and said that they have relatives that rent a cottage up in Wetumpka. The door’s open, the lights are on. So we did that. I’d been up twenty-six hours trying to move the boat, and then drive four hours up to Wetumpka. So it was a very exhausting day. And then when I woke up, we didn’t have a TV here, we’re out here in a cottage. So we started receiving information through our phones, and watching TV on our phones, the Weather Channel.\n\n“I’m worried to death about my boat, and I received a photograph of her in the water. Everyone said, ‘Oh, look, she’s crashing into the bridge.’ But I knew better, because I’d been there, and there’s these giant boulders before the bridge. And I’m looking at the structure lines—there’s a metal palm-tree thing that was screwed on the very back, and I’m looking at it, and I see all of these things, and they’re still perfect. And I’m, like, ‘My gosh, she’ll just float, she’ll just stay right there.’ But what happened was, the anchor loses its grip.\n\n“I got more calls, saying, ‘She’s not there anymore.’ I was, like, ‘That’s cool, we’ll find her in the morning. She’s going to pass under the bridge. She’ll be out there in John Q. Citizen’s back yard, floating.’ The problem was, the winds were forcing her under the smallest portion of where the bridge comes down, where the water is very shallow. It peeled the entire roof off. That’s still sitting under the bridge right now.

More than a million people—including many who would not normally evacuate, such as hospitalized patients and the staff of military bases—fled the region.\n\nBut thousands of people were never given a chance to leave, because they were locked inside prison cells across South Carolina. Bryan Stirling, the director of the South Carolina Department of Corrections, or S.C.D.C., chose not to evacuate several prisons—including Ridgeland, MacDougall, and Lieber Correctional Institutions—in counties that over the past week fell within the mandatory evacuation zone. (North Carolina and Virginia evacuated numerous prisons and jails along the coast.) On Monday, the official S.C.D.C. Twitter account posted a photograph of incarcerated men shovelling sand into bags. “In the past, it’s been safer to leave them there,” Dexter Lee, a S.C.D.C. spokesperson, [told](https://www.thestate.com/news/state/south-carolina/article218179005.html) the *State*. A county jail that houses more than a thousand people just a few miles from the coast in Charleston [also declined to evacuate](https://www.thestate.com/news/state/south-carolina/article218318765.html). “The people of SC who you’re responsible for include those who are incarcerated, Gov. McMaster,” [the A.C.L.U. wrote](https://twitter.com/ACLU/status/1039957885449646082) on Twitter. “You can’t leave them in harm’s way.”\n\nOn Friday morning, a source inside a South Carolina maximum-security prison who asked me to call him Albert said that the storm had not yet reached him. “No winds that I can see,” he said. “Not even rain.” For the past several days, Albert has barely left his cell. “We’re all locked down until after the storm,” he wrote in a text message, sent from a contraband cell phone. Correctional officers are refusing to let prisoners store extra water, he said. “Not allowed bottles or buckets,” he wrote. “They call it contraband.” He said the building seemed secure but warned that if heavy rains fell, they could be dangerous for men on the lowest level. “I can remember one flood to where the water came knee high,” he wrote. “Those guys are going to drown if it rains enough.”\n\nStirling, reached by phone on Thursday evening, told me that a prison evacuation would have created logistical challenges and public-safety concerns. “We would have a thousand prisoners on buses, on potentially very congested routes. It’s not safe for anybody,” he told me. He confirmed that prisoners were not allowed to store water in bottles and said that even if prisons had been evacuated earlier this week, the storm might have changed course. “We would be playing hopscotch,” he said. South Carolina prisons are known to be understaffed and overcrowded; earlier this year, state correctional officers took hours to intervene in a riot that killed seven men.\n\nAnother incarcerated man, who asked me to call him Mike, told me that he spent a past storm locked in a flooding cell at Lieber Correctional Institution, thirty miles inland from Charleston. (Both Albert and Mike shared their real names with *The New Yorker* but spoke on the condition of anonymity, fearing retaliation from prison officials.) Over the phone, Mike described the terror he felt, unable to see outside as the water rose. “It actually was past your ankles,” he said, of the past storm. “We were yelling for the guards—you know, ‘Hey! Open the doors! They flooding!’&nbsp;” He said that correctional officers didn’t let them out until men started to yell out, “Tell my kids I love them.” When asked about past flooding at Lieber, Stirling asserted that storms had not caused floods there in decades.\n\nIn the week leading up to Hurricane Florence, members of the public struggled to obtain basic information about the prison system’s plans. As of Friday, no information about the hurricane had been posted to the S.C.D.C. Web site. Amina P. Stephens, a Myrtle Beach resident whose husband is incarcerated, said she had to call S.C.D.C. officials roughly fifteen times over the course of a week to confirm that state prisons would not be evacuated. (One minimum-security S.C.D.C. facility, which housed two hundred and sixty-six people, was evacuated.) On Tuesday, after numerous calls and e-mailed questions, Dexter Lee sent me a short statement. “We will continue to monitor this hurricane,” he wrote. “Due to security reasons we do not announce advanced inmate movements.” On Thursday, he sent me a slightly longer statement, adding, “All SCDC institutions have food, water, and other essential supplies for the storm duration. All institutions have generators with the ability to operate for 10 days without refueling.”\n\nPast hurricanes have devastated prisons across the country. During [Hurricane Katrina](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/hurricane-katrina), people were [trapped in flooded cells with nothing to eat or drink](https://www.aclu.org/news/aclu-report-details-horrors-suffered-orleans-parish-prisoners-wake-hurricane-katrina). Last year, after [Hurricane Harvey](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/hurricane-harvey), prisoners reported flooding in cells; a man in a Texas prison [told me](https://www.newyorker.com/sections/news/weathering-a-hurricane-in-prison) that he lost access to functioning toilets and running water. Kathy Morse, who served four years in New York state prisons for embezzling money from a law firm, said she was evacuated from a prison in the Manhattan neighborhood of Chelsea for [Hurricane Sandy](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/hurricane-sandy). “It’s pouring rain out, the winds are blowing—you could look out your window, and there’s nobody out there,” Morse recalled, adding that most other people downtown had already left. She said that a prison staff member later told her that her building had flooded up to the third floor.\n\nWhen Hurricane Florence made landfall in North Carolina, on Friday, storm surges caused serious flooding, and hundreds of thousands of people lost power. The storm is expected to move southwest slowly, weakening as it dumps many inches of rain across the region. Parts of South Carolina currently face tropical-storm conditions, with winds around fifty miles per hour and a forecast of several consecutive days of rain. On Thursday night, Albert said the mood in his prison was sombre. “Everyone’s quiet,” he wrote. Mike feared the worst, saying, “The storm that we experienced was nowhere near comparison to what’s on the way.” Amina Stephens said that she was worried about her husband and disappointed in Governor McMaster. “I just want him to imagine himself on the other side,” she said. “Because it could be him. At any given moment, it could be any of us.”","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"sections":[{"id":"590a02541c7a8e33fb390be1","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News Desk","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news-desk"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5910a7a7da97f12ef9160a60","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"","canonicalUrl":"http://www.newyorker.com/contributors/daniel-a-gross","email":"","name":"Daniel A.

But many Americans have been unable to flee, including huge\nnumbers of prison inmates. The two states together are home to a quarter\nmillion incarcerated people. Texas has the largest prison population in\nthe country, and Florida has the third-largest.\n\nDuring Hurricane Harvey, many Texas prisoners were locked in their cells\nwith limited access to water and electricity. After officials decided\nnot to evacuate a federal prison in Beaumont, Texas, hundreds of guards\nstruggled to show up for work. [Inmates\nsaid](http://www.chron.com/news/houston-weather/hurricaneharvey/article/Harvey-beaumont-prison-inmates-speak-out-texas-12167587.php) that they lost access to medication, and one prisoner told his wife that\ncells flooded up to calf-height. These reports came six weeks after a\nfederal judge [ordered the state to improve prison\nconditions](http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/19/us/texas-prison-heat-lawsuit/index.html) during the intense summer heat, which has killed twenty-three inmates\nsince 1998.\n\nSherrard Williams, who is serving a life sentence for being party\nto a murder when he was fifteen, weathered the storm in a two-person\ncell in Connally Unit, a maximum-security prison in Kenedy, Texas. He is\nthirty-eight. His account has been edited and condensed.\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\n“It all began on Friday. You could hear the wind\nout there, powerful wind, and a lot of thunder. I guess the rain caused\na lot of damage that affected the unit. They placed us in our cells on\nFriday evening because of security reasons. When the storm actually came\nthrough, we went through the experience of the power being shut off, to\nwhere everything was completely in disarray. No lights, no electricity.\nThe generators couldn’t even function where I was at. After that, hours\nlater, the water was cut off. I don’t know how, I don’t know why.  \n  \n“When the water got cut off, you couldn’t use the restrooms in the cell.\nNow you gotta watch what you eat, you gotta watch what you drink. They\ncame around with some water and brought us sack lunches—sandwiches,\nthings like that. I couldn’t eat because it was going to make me use the\nrestroom, and then the whole cell is gonna be messed up. Nibbled at a\nbit of this, a bit of that. You’re pretty much just trying to manage\nwhat you put inside your body. We were using jugs of water to pour into\nthe toilet to help us flush it.  \n  \n“They had problems with some of the locks. The doors, they’re controlled\nby a mechanism, so when the power went out, they couldn’t control them.\nThey got a key—but if the key doesn’t work, or perhaps there’s something\nwrong with the locks, the inmate is trapped in there. They had to come\ndown and basically break the door down.  \n  \n“My cellmate, Joseph, just came over here from Travis County, because of\n[that heat\nissue](http://www.cnn.com/2017/08/09/us/texas-hot-prison-transfer/index.html).\nHe’s about to reënter back into society. He came from a state jail\nfacility. Now you placed him on a maximum-security unit. It’s a lot of\nfear for those who have never been in this situation. You got the lights\noff, there’s no electricity, there’s no water. What’s next? Anxiety is\nsetting in instantly. We pretty much coached each other through the\nwhole thing. I’m more of a thinker. I kind of listen to what my mind is\ntelling me. Reminding myself it’s gonna be all right.  \n  \n“Monday they was able to get Porta Potties placed on the recreational\nyard. That really saved us. If you want to eat a little something, now\nyou can eat.  \n  \n“There was one correctional officer, a captain, that came in on Monday.\nShe spoke for, like, thirty minutes to us. She explained everything that\nwas going on. She said, ‘It’s nothing to do with race. There’s people\ngoing through a lot of things. There’s devastation. They need prayer.\nGod is in here. Pray for them.’ That’s pretty much what the fellas\nneeded to hear. I thought about the people that was going through this\ndisaster, in the free world. I stayed in the cell and prayed.\n\n“You find some type of solace, knowing what you can possibly control,\nand focussing on that. If something happens, if the storm comes through,\nI don’t think they gonna concentrate too much on you. They’re gonna\nworry about the officers first. In Beaumont, a federal prison, they\ndidn’t evacuate the prisoners. I think that’s the most frightening\nthing. That could have been us.  \n  \n“I prayed that the new prison administration was able to pull us up out\nof this relatively quick. The administration just came two or three days\nbefore the hurricane. They changed out the wardens, all at one time. It\ntook at least a week to get everything back to its function. There is no\ngood in this experience at all. But I believe that they was able to\nbring things back to normal swiftly. Under the last prison\nadministration, it may have been worse.  \n  \n“When the power was restored, I listened to the radio and read some\nnewspapers. It’s a reality check for me, to make me want to get out and\ndo the right thing. I don’t want to be locked up. I’d rather deal with\nreal-world problems than deal with it in here. I’d rather look Harvey in\nthe eye.”","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"sections":[{"id":"5904126172dadf5d0a508800","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news"},{"id":"595424dfab8b144c1b18882b","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"As Told To","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"as-told-to"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5910a7a7da97f12ef9160a60","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"","canonicalUrl":"http://www.newyorker.com/contributors/daniel-a-gross","email":"","name":"Daniel A.

The Saudi press posted photos of Bezos in an open-necked shirt and the prince, having shed his Saudi robes, in a Western suit and dark-red tie. Both men beamed as they talked business and investment opportunities. Bezos was among the prosperous and powerful Americans who met the crown prince during a three-week [road show](https://www.chron.com/business/article/Saudi-crown-prince-wraps-up-U-S-tour-in-Houston-12815405.php), which took him from Harvard to Hollywood and Houston. Along the way, the crown prince also schmoozed with Oprah Winfrey, Bill Gates, both former Presidents Bush, former President Bill Clinton, Kobe Bryant, Michael Bloomberg, Morgan Freeman, Henry Kissinger, Dwayne (the Rock) Johnson, and Richard Branson, among others. He wooed Google, Apple, Disney, Lockheed, Snapchat, and AMC.\n\nDuring Prince Mohammed’s stop in Washington, where he brokered billions of dollars in arms deals, [President Trump](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump) said that Washington’s relationship with the House of Saud was “probably as good as it’s really ever been, and I think will probably only get better.” At each stop, M.B.S., as he’s widely known at home, was heralded as a reformer in one of the world’s most authoritarian states—and possibly even the face of the future Middle East.\n\nThe bizarre disappearance of the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi has abruptly transformed the image of the desert kingdom and its crown prince, who has become its de-facto leader since his appointment, in June, 2017. On Sunday, the Washington *Post*, which Bezos owns, ran a full-page ad with a picture of the consulate’s front door. “On Tuesday, October 2 at 1:14 p.m. Washington *Post* columnist Jamal Khashoggi entered the Consulate of Saudi Arabia,” it read, at the top. “He has not been seen since. *DEMAND ANSWERS*{:.small},” it said at the bottom.\n\nKhashoggi may have accomplished in his disappearance—and possible death—what he had tried to do for the past year from exile, in Washington: hold the kingdom, and specifically its reckless crown prince, accountable for its misdeeds. The grisly prospect that he was dismembered by a hit squad dispatched from [Saudi Arabia](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/saudi-arabia), as Turkish officials have reported, has revolted some of those who just months ago competed to fête M.B.S.\n\n“In his early days, the crown prince was gaining a public image, in significant circles of U.S. public opinion, as a radically different leader from the conservative elderly monarchs of Saudi yore,” Paul Salem, the acting president of the Middle East Institute, told me. “But a darker narrative was also gaining ground, based on his arrest of women activists, business leaders, and silencing critics. The Khashoggi affair has solidified the negative narrative in wide cross-sections of U.S. public opinion.” \n\nTrump’s response has been mixed. On CBS’s “60 Minutes” on Sunday, the President pledged “severe punishment” of Saudi Arabia if it is found responsible for Khashoggi’s abduction or death. “There’s something really terrible and disgusting about that, if that was the case, so we’re going to have to see,” he told Lesley Stahl. “It’s being looked at very, very strongly. And we would be very upset and angry if that were the case. As of this moment, they deny it, and they deny it vehemently. Could it be them? Yes.” He vowed that the United States is “going to get to the bottom of it, and there will be severe punishment.” On Saturday, though, Trump said he would not pull out of billions in arms deals with the kingdom. “It’s the best equipment in the world, but, if they don’t buy it from us, they’re going to buy it from Russia or they’re going to buy it from China or they’re going to buy it from other countries,” he [said](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/411271-trump-defends-110-billion-us-arms-sale-to-saudi-arabia). \n\nTrump has long had close business ties with the Saudis, beginning in the nineteen-nineties. When his real-estate business was in trouble, he sold his yacht and a stake in the Plaza Hotel to a Saudi royal. He also sold Manhattan real estate to Saudi investors and, before becoming President, explored opening a hotel in the port city of Jeddah. Since Trump took office, Saudi Arabia has been the central player in his foreign policy. His first stop on his first foreign tour as President was in its capital city, Riyadh, where he was fêted with pomp and ceremony. His son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner, has developed particularly close ties with M.B.S. and personally promoted him as a reliable American partner in the region. \n\nOn Monday, Trump told reporters that he has spoken with King Salman, who “firmly denied any knowledge” about Khashoggi’s disappearance. (The kingdom also initially denied that Saudi citizens had anything to do with the September 11th attacks, blaming an Israeli intelligence plot.) For the first time, Trump offered an alternative possibility that “rogue killers” were linked to the reported murder. In a tweet, [the President announced](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1051814214212485120) that he is dispatching Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to Riyadh for talks, although the visit appears designed to smooth over tensions, which escalated in heated rhetoric from both sides over the weekend, rather than get to the bottom of the Khashoggi case.\n\nCongress may have other ideas. Since Khashoggi’s disappearance, Republicans and Democrats alike have turned on Saudi Arabia, which spends lavishly on a sophisticated public-relations campaign in the United States. “If this is proven to be true, there is going to be a response from Congress,” the Florida Republican Marco Rubio, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “It’s going to be nearly unanimous, it’s going to be swift, and it’s going to go pretty far.”\n\nRubio said that deferring to the kingdom would effectively give a green light to other dictators. “Our ability to call Putin a murderer, because he is; our ability to call Assad a murderer, because he is; our ability to confront Maduro in Venezuela or any of these other human-rights atrocities like what we see in China—all of that is undermined and compromised if we somehow decide that, because an ally who was important did that, we are not going to call it out.”\n\nLast week, a bipartisan group of twenty-two senators—eleven Republicans and eleven Democrats—invoked the [Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2018/10/12/what-is-the-global-magnitsky-act-and-why-are-u-s-senators-invoking-this-on-saudi-arabia/) in a letter calling on the White House to investigate Khashoggi’s disappearance. The law, passed in 2016 and named for a Russian whistle-blower who died in detention, calls for the United States to impose sanctions on human-rights violators in any country. It stipulates that action should be taken within four months. “A bill to block arms sales to Saudi Arabia was only narrowly defeated last year,” Salem told me. “The Senate might become a no-vote on Saudi issues for some time forward.”\n\nThe revulsion—and questioning of both M.B.S. and his country—is spreading internationally. On Sunday, Britain, France, and Germany, the three most powerful European governments, issued a joint [statement](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/joint-statement-on-the-disappearance-of-jamal-khashoggi-by-foreign-ministers-from-the-uk-france-and-germany) expressing “grave concern” about Khashoggi’s fate. They demanded a “credible investigation” that will “provide a complete and detailed response.”\n\nAlmost two weeks after Khashoggi disappeared, Saudi Arabia has still provided little insight into the case beyond blanket denials. On Sunday, it issued another one—with no name or office attached to it—threatening countermeasures if any government acts against it. “The kingdom affirms its total rejection of any threats and attempts to undermine it, whether by threatening to impose economic sanctions, using political pressures, or repeating false accusations,” it said. “The Kingdom also affirms that if it receives any action, it will respond with greater action.”\n\nM.B.S., who controls the five major levers of power within the royal family, has reacted rashly before. In August, Saudi Arabia [expelled](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/saudi-arabias-crown-prince-picks-a-very-strange-fight-with-canada) the Canadian Ambassador, froze all new trade, suspended flights, and recalled all Saudi students in Canada after its foreign minister tweeted about the case of siblings in the Badawi family, both human-rights activists. In November, the kingdom summoned the Lebanese Prime Minister, Saad Hariri, and ordered him to resign on Saudi state television. He remained under virtual house arrest for two weeks. He was freed to return home—and resume office—only after the U.S. and Europe intervened. And the Saudi war on Yemen, launched shortly after M.B.S. became defense minister, in 2015, has produced the world’s gravest humanitarian crisis, with no end in sight.\n\nThe Saudi public is clearly unsettled by the international furor. The Saudi stock market [plunged](http://apnews.com/fccc0ed10f3842acb8b8dd3447a79b69) by almost seven per cent when it opened on Sunday. It may have been rattled partly by the big names in U.S. business, technology, and energy that have either severed their ties with the kingdom or dropped out of a [conference](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/13/world/middleeast/saudi-arabia-conference-crown-prince-mohammed.html) later this month—billed as “Davos in the Desert”—that is pivotal to lure investment for M.B.S.’s ambitious plan to diversify the kingdom’s oil-reliant economy. Uber and Viacom dropped out of the conference, as did the tech investor Steve Case. The Harbor Group, which reportedly made millions lobbying for the Saudis, [terminated](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2018/10/12/western-walkout-saudi-davos-desert-conference-over-jamal-khashoggi-undermines-kingdoms-modernization-plans/) the relationship.\n\nBranson, who hosted the crown prince last spring in the California desert, issued a scathing statement on Thursday. “What has reportedly happened in Turkey around the disappearance of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, if proved true, would clearly change the ability of any of us in the West to do business with the Saudi Government,” he [wrote](https://www.virgin.com/richard-branson/my-statement-kingdom-saudi-arabia) in a blog post. \n\nRelations between Washington and Riyadh have been this strained only twice before: in 2001, fifteen of the nineteen hijackers who flew planes into the World Trade Center, in New York, and the Pentagon, in Washington, were identified as Saudi. And, in 1973, Saudi Arabia was a key part of the oil boycott on the United States, after Washington supported Israel during the fourth Middle East war. \n\nOne of the ironies of the Khashoggi affair is that he is not even an American citizen. He took up residency in Washington after he opted for exile in mid-2017. But the rippling impact during the past two weeks has been sweeping—with more to come. “The U.S.-Saudi relationship is going through its most acute crisis since 2001,” Salem told me. “Unless the disappearance and/or murder of Khashoggi is dramatically addressed or redressed, this crisis will greatly and negatively impact the crown prince’s plans for a rapid and globalized takeoff of Saudi economy and society.”\n\n*This post has been updated to include President Trump’s comments on Monday regarding a call with the King of Saudi Arabia.*","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"sections":[{"id":"590a02541c7a8e33fb390be1","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"590a02541c7a8e33fb390be1","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News Desk","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news-desk"},{"id":"5904126172dadf5d0a508800","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news"},{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"}],"name":"News Desk","parent":[{"id":"5904126172dadf5d0a508800","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"},"slug":"news-desk"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"web","contributors":[{"id":"5910a8a54e65be2f29d55eb2","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Robin Wright has been a contributing writer to *The New Yorker* since\n1988.

The Saudi dissident, a fifty-nine-year-old former editor and government adviser, was convinced that the kingdom’s new leadership wanted to kill him. “Of course they’d like to see me out of the picture,” he said. He’d said it to me before, but by then he had been in exile, in Washington, for more than a year, so I thought he was exaggerating the dangers. Maybe not. Khashoggi hasn’t been seen since he went into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, on Tuesday, to get papers verifying his divorce so that he could remarry. His fiancée, who waited outside for eleven hours, said he never emerged.\t\n\nFive days have passed, with no proof of life, and international human-rights groups now allege that Khashoggi has been abducted. On Sunday, Yasin Aktay, an adviser to Turkish President Tayyip Recep Erdoğan, told Reuters that Turkey believes Khashoggi was murdered in the Saudi consulate, adding that fifteen Saudis were allegedly involved in Khashoggi’s disappearance. Erdoğan told reporters that his government is investigating the event. “Entries and exits into the embassy, airport transits, and all camera records are being looked at and followed,” he told reporters. “We want to swiftly get results.” The U.S. State Department also said it is closely following the case. A Turkish colleague of Khashoggi’s told journalists, on Sunday, that the Turkish government advised him to “make your funeral preparation.” Khashoggi had been killed “in a barbaric way” and then dismembered, Turan Kışlakçı, who heads the Turkish-Arab Media Association, told the Associated Press. Another report claimed that his body had been taken back to Saudi Arabia.\n\nKhashoggi has long been an important voice in the kingdom. I’ve known him for decades. He had been loyal to the royals, and, for many foreign journalists and experts, he was always a good place to start to understand the monarchy’s thinking. Khashoggi served as the editor of the Saudi daily newspaper *Al Watan* and headed a television station. But he became increasingly critical of the government and, in June, 2017, decided to leave. Even in exile, he still influenced the debate about the kingdom’s future, with almost 1.7 million [followers](https://twitter.com/JKhashoggi?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) on Twitter, a Global Opinions [column](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/global-opinions/wp/2018/10/06/read-jamal-khashoggis-columns-for-the-washington-post/?utm_term=.a79fbb0afb3b) in the Washington *Post,* and regular appearances on international television. \n\n The bizarre mystery surrounding Khashoggi’s disappearance is part of a broader trend since the appointment, in June of last year, of the young Saudi crown prince, [Mohammed bin Salman](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/04/09/a-saudi-princes-quest-to-remake-the-middle-east), who is more commonly known by his initials, M.B.S. The thirty-three-year-old has pledged sweeping reforms, but his rule has been increasingly ruthless, with mass arrests of businessmen, and even other princes, and death sentences meted out, this year, to a women’s-rights activist and also to moderate clerics who have preached against extremism. “Above and beyond the persecution of activists, writers, clerics, scholars, and businessmen inside Saudi, where the Saudis could claim some kind of ‘process,’ the apparent kidnapping of Khashoggi is now a pattern of attacks where the Saudis don’t even make a pretense of legality,” Sarah Leah Whitson, the executive director of Human Rights Watch’s Middle East division, told me on Sunday.\n\nThe growing campaign of intimidation, she noted, includes the arrest, in May, of Loujain al-Hathloul, a women’s-rights activist who once ranked third among the Arab world’s hundred most powerful women—even as the kingdom said that it was opening up opportunities for women by allowing them to drive, an issue that Hathloul had championed. Another is what Whitson called the “goonish [assault](https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2Famp%2Famp.albawaba.com%2Fnews%2Fsaudi-human-rights-activist-punched-men-backing-mbs-london-1187358&data=02%7C01%7Cwhitsos%40hrw.org%7C2bea8ce31bd54e27d1ca08d62c453a60%7C2eb79de4d8044273a6e64b3188855f66%7C1%7C0%7C636745073187389660&sdata=ZpPgbgjJptd3yIqp97Jfh2nliVB9sX6VRzDWJaX1uwA%3D&reserved=0)” on Ghanem al-Dosari, who is famed for his satirical YouTube videos criticizing the Saudi royal family, by Saudi agents in London. Three Saudi princes have been abducted since King Salman, M.B.S.’s father, became king, in 2015, the BBC reported. Taken together, Whitson said, all of these acts “reflect the brazen, crude, Qaddafi-like nature of the Saudi crown prince, and, above all, his message to Saudis inside and outside the country: you better shut up. You are not safe. There is no law that can protect you.”\n\nIn an interview with Bloomberg this past Wednesday, the crown prince dismissed reports of Khashoggi’s abduction as unfounded “rumors,” and vowed to probe the case alongside Turkish authorities. “My understanding is he entered and he got out after a few minutes or one hour. I’m not sure,” M.B.S. said. “We are ready to welcome the Turkish government to go and search our premises. The premises are sovereign territory, but we will allow them to enter and search and do whatever they want to do. We have nothing to hide.” \n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\nOn Saturday, four days after Khashoggi’s disappearance, the Saudi consul-general in Istanbul, Mohammed al-Otaibi, took Reuters journalists on a tour of the six-story consulate, opening cupboards and doors to prove that Khashoggi was not there. On Sunday, I e-mailed Adel al-Jubeir, the Saudi foreign minister (and a former neighbor of mine, when he lived in Washington as a young diplomat), asking about Khashoggi’s status. He did not reply.\n\nBut experts on Saudi Arabia suspect a more ominous pattern. “The crocodile tears of the crown prince and other Saudi officials are probably for deception and prevarication,” Bruce Riedel, a former C.I.A., Pentagon, and National Security Council staffer who is now at the Brookings Institution, told me. “The disappearance of Jamal fits with a pattern of crude intimidation and the silencing of criticism and dissent.”\n\nIn words that now haunt his own case, Khashoggi told me, in August, that the crown prince has “no tolerance or willingness to accommodate critics.” Although he is technically next in line to the throne, M.B.S. acts as the country’s de-facto leader, Khashoggi said, and has already become more autocratic than any of the previous six kings who have ruled since the death of Ibn Saud, the founder of modern Saudi Arabia, in 1953.\n\nWhen we spoke last November, Khashoggi compared the Saudi monarchy to the Iranian theocracy. “M.B.S. is now becoming the supreme leader,” he said, a reference to Iran’s top authority, who has veto power over every branch of the government. Since his father became king, in 2015, M.B.S. has consolidated his hold on the five major sectors of power, serving as minister of defense, head of a new economic council, and chief of the royal court. “He is very autocratic and totally illiberal,” Khashoggi told me in August. “I worked for the government for four or five years. I never thought I’d be arrested, but then I thought I might. That’s why I left.” Khashoggi’s status became ever more precarious as his critiques of the monarchy sharpened in recent months.\n\nIn a statement on Sunday, the Washington *Post* called Khashoggi a “committed, courageous journalist.” Fred Hiatt, the *Post’s* editorial-page editor, said, “He writes out of a sense of love for his country and deep faith in human dignity and freedom. We have been enormously proud to publish his writing.” Hiatt called reports of Khashoggi’s murder “a monstrous and unfathomable act.”\n\n[Amnesty International](https://www.amnestyusa.org/press-releases/alleged-assassination-of-jamal-khashoggi-in-saudi-consulate-in-istanbul-would-set-abysmal-new-low/) called reports of Khashoggi’s assassination “an abysmal new low. Such an assassination within the grounds of the consulate, which is territory under Saudi Arabian jurisdiction, would amount to an extrajudicial execution. This case sends a shockwave among Saudi Arabian human rights defenders and dissidents everywhere, eroding any notion of seeking safe haven abroad.” \n\nIn one of his early columns for the *Post*, in September, 2017, Khashoggi said it had taken a long time for him to reach the point of challenging his own government. “It was painful for me several years ago when several friends were arrested. I said nothing. I didn’t want to lose my job or my freedom. I worried about my family,” he wrote. “I have made a different choice now. I have left my home, my family and my job, and I am raising my voice. To do otherwise would betray those who languish in prison. I can speak when so many cannot. I want you to know that Saudi Arabia has not always been as it is now. We Saudis deserve better.” \n\nThey certainly do.

In Washington, the Department of Justice indicted seven Russian military-intelligence agents for multiple hacking schemes. Britain charged that Russia is now behaving like a “pariah state,” because of its brazen use of chemical weapons, its meddling in Western elections, and its attempted cybersabotage of probes into its illegal activities. And the Dutch government disclosed that it had deported four Russian intelligence agents who were caught red-handed, in April, trying to hack the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, an international monitoring agency based in The Hague. The agency was investigating the poison attack on [Sergei Skripal](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/under-russian-terror-all-exiles-are-fearful-and-all-deaths-are-suspicious), a former Russian spy in exile in Britain, and also the use of chemical weapons by the Syrian government, Russia’s closest ally in the Middle East.\n\nIn Brussels, the U.S. Defense Secretary, James Mattis, met with defense ministers from the other twenty-eight *NATO*{:.small} countries, who agreed that Russia must pay a price for its malfeasance. Mattis pledged that America would stand behind its allies against Vladimir Putin’s intervention. “We are ready to provide cybersupport to counter Russian hacking,“ he said.\n\nThe Justice Department’s indictment alleged that Russia’s state intelligence service, the G.R.U., engaged in a four-year cyber campaign against international organizations, including a U.S. group that had exposed doping among Russia’s Olympic athletes. The forty-one-page document chronicled conspiracy, disinformation, identity theft, money laundering, wire fraud, and data theft, to “further Russian interests, retaliate against Russia’s detractors and sway public opinion in Russia’s favor.” It also charged that a Russian agent had spied on the networks and staff of Westinghouse Electric, a nuclear-power company based in Pennsylvania that has reportedly done business with Ukraine.\n\nThe new allegations are not part of Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian meddling in the U.S. election, but the two scandals share similarities and may involve the same conspirators. “They evince some of the same methods of computer intrusion and the same overarching Russian strategic goal: to pursue its interests through illegal influence and disinformation operations aimed at muddying or altering perceptions of the truth,” John Demers, the Justice Department’s Assistant Attorney General, [said](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/10/04/russia-cyberattacks-justice-department-charges-869435?nname=playbook-pm&nid=0000015a-dd3e-d536-a37b-dd7fd8af0000&nrid=0000014e-f116-dd93-ad7f-f91725480002&nlid=964328) at a press briefing.\n\nThe West’s united front against Russia included tough warnings. “The G.R.U.’s actions are reckless and indiscriminate,” Jeremy Hunt , the British foreign secretary, said. “Our message is clear: together, with our allies, we will expose and respond to the G.R.U.’s attempts to undermine international stability.” The Russian Foreign Ministry angrily rejected Europe’s charges as the products of a “rich imagination.” Maria Zakharova, a spokeswoman, reportedly told a press briefing that the allegations were “some kind of a diabolical perfume cocktail.”\n\nBut the West’s collaboration may have little effect on Russia’s behavior. “I don’t anticipate any change,” Alina Polyakova, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, told me. “The latest indictments are primarily symbolic.” No actions by the West—whether they be punitive sanctions or positive diplomatic outreach—have had much impact on Putin’s government. “The Trump Administration pushed through even tougher sanctions than Obama did, some coördinated with the European Union,” Polyakova said. “But we’re still seeing this massive cyberattack in the Netherlands, the disinformation campaign surrounding the attempted Skripal assassination, and the Russian attacks of U.S. congressional candidates in the current election. Russia is on a clear course of more aggressive behavior toward the West. Strong statements and narrow sanctions won’t change that.”\n\nDespite their warm rapport [in Helsinki](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/trumps-appeasement-summit-with-putin), in July, Putin had some angry words for Trump this week. The Russian leader cited Trump’s recent complaint that the price of oil is too high. “Donald, if you want to find the culprit for the rise in prices, you need to look in the mirror,” Putin told the Russian Energy Week conference, in Moscow. Today’s prices are “largely the result of the current U.S. Administration—these expectations of sanctions against Iran, the political problems in Venezuela. Look at what’s happening in Libya. The state is destroyed. It’s the result of irresponsible policies which have a direct impact on the world economy.”\n\nTrump’s image among Russians is tanking. Only nineteen per cent now have a positive image of the U.S. leader—down from fifty-three per cent a year ago, according to [a poll](http://www.pewglobal.org/2018/10/01/trumps-international-ratings-remain-low-especially-among-key-allies/) released this week by the Pew Research Center. The majority no longer believes that the President will fulfill his campaign promise to better relations with Moscow. “It has been over two years, and nothing is improving. In fact, sanctions-wise, it is getting worse,” Nina Khrushcheva, the granddaughter of the former Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev and a professor of international affairs at the New School, told me. “Russians are pleased with the reverence Trump displays in relations to Putin, but the U.S. President does look weak in their eyes. All this positive rhetoric, and he can’t rein in his people. ‘What kind of a leader is he?’ Russians wonder. It is certainly a sign of not winning, when the President can’t pursue the policy of good relations he says he wants.”\n\nThe sharp drop in positive perceptions of Trump is not limited to Russia. The Pew poll, which covered twenty-five countries, found that Trump scored just as low—or lower—among America’s longtime allies. In Germany, arguably the most powerful country in Europe, only ten per cent of the public had confidence that Trump would “do the right thing in world affairs.” In France, it was nine per cent. The President earned his lowest score in Mexico—a country he wants to wall off—with only six per cent. The poll found that people in the twenty-five nations surveyed had more confidence in both Putin (thirty per cent over all) and Chinese President Xi Jinping (thirty-four per cent) to do the right thing than they did in Trump (twenty-seven per cent).\n\nUnder Trump, America’s image has suffered, too, its approval dropping by almost fifty per cent in Germany and France in the two years since he was elected. Worldwide, seventy per cent of those polled lacked confidence in the world’s most powerful leader—even as half the world maintained a favorable view of the United States. “It’s more interesting—and more comforting—that there’s a large and growing gap between international perceptions of Trump and perceptions of the United States,” Ian Bremmer, the president of the Eurasia Group, told me. “Nearly two years in, people around the world are starting to recognize that Trump-talk and American actions are strongly differentiated.”","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"sections":[{"id":"590a02541c7a8e33fb390be1","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News Desk","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news-desk"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5910a8a54e65be2f29d55eb2","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Robin Wright has been a contributing writer to *The New Yorker* since\n1988.

This summer, when a social worker asked her to identify her strengths, Helen shared her pride in “her ability to learn fast and express her feelings and concerns.” She also recounted her favorite activities (“playing with her dolls”), her usual bedtime (“8 *P.M.*{:.small}”), and her professional aspirations (“to be a veterinarian”). \n\nIn July, Helen fled Honduras with her grandmother, Noehmi, and several other relatives; gangs had threatened Noehmi’s teen-age son, Christian, and the family no longer felt safe. Helen’s mother, Jeny, had migrated to Texas four years earlier, and Noehmi planned to seek legal refuge there. With Noehmi’s help, Helen travelled thousands of miles, sometimes on foot, and frequently fell behind the group. While crossing the Rio Grande in the journey’s final stretch, Helen slipped from their raft and risked drowning. Her grandmother grabbed her hand and cried, “Hang on, Helen!” When the family reached the scrubland of southern Texas, U.S. Border Patrol agents apprehended them and moved them through a series of detention centers. A month earlier, the Trump Administration had announced, amid public outcry over its systemic separation of migrant families at the border, that it would halt the practice. But, at a packed processing hub, Christian was taken from Noehmi and placed in a cage with toddlers. Noehmi remained in a cold holding cell, clutching Helen. Soon, she recalled, a plainclothes official arrived and informed her that she and Helen would be separated. “No!” Noehmi cried. “The girl is under my care! Please!”\n\nNoehmi said that the official told her, “Don’t make things too difficult,” and pulled Helen from her arms. “The girl will stay here,” he said, “and you’ll be deported.” Helen cried as he escorted her from the room and out of sight. Noehmi remembers the authorities explaining that Helen’s mother would be able to retrieve her, soon, from wherever they were taking her. \n\nLater that day, Noehmi and Christian were reunited. The adults in the family were fitted with electronic ankle bracelets and all were released, pending court dates. They left the detention center and rushed to Jeny’s house, in McAllen, hoping to find Helen there. When they didn’t, Noehmi began to shake, struggling to explain the situation. “Immigration took your daughter,” she told Jeny.\n\n“But where did they take her?” Jeny asked.\n\n“I don’t know,” Noehmi replied.\n\nThe next day, authorities—likely from the Office of Refugee Resettlement (O.R.R.)—called to say that they were holding Helen at a shelter near Houston; according to Noehmi, they wouldn’t say exactly where. Noehmi and Jeny panicked. Unable to breathe amid her distress, Noehmi checked herself into a local hospital, where doctors gave her medication to calm her down. “I thought we would never see her again,” Noehmi said. She couldn’t square her family’s fate with the TV news, which insisted that the government had stopped separating migrant families.\n\n+++feature-xsmall\n[#image: /photos/5bbf99a86b3a9e2ce9a74f4b]||||||\n+++\n\nHelen had been brought to Baytown, a shelter run by Baptist Child & Family Services, which the federal government had contracted to house unaccompanied minors. Helen was given a pack of crayons and spent the summer coloring patriotic images: busts of George Washington and Abraham Lincoln, the torch on the Statue of Liberty. She was granted an hour of “Large Muscle Activity and Leisure Time” each day, and received lessons on the human respiratory system, the history of music, and “the risk and danger of social media.” “Helen,” a caseworker observed, “has excellent behavior at all times.” She had no major sources of stress, her reports noted, aside from “being separated from her family.” Her teachers encouraged her to develop “*SMART*{:.small} goals”—ambitions that are “Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound.” Helen’s goal was simple: “Minor disclosed wanting to live with her mother and family in the U.S.”\n\nAccording to a long-standing legal precedent known as the Flores settlement, which established guidelines for keeping children in immigration detention, Helen had a right to a bond hearing before a judge; that hearing would have likely hastened her release from government custody and her return to her family. At the time of her apprehension, in fact, Helen checked a box on a line that read, “I do request an immigration judge,” asserting her legal right to have her custody reviewed. But, in early August, an unknown official handed Helen a legal document, a “Request for a Flores Bond Hearing,” which described a set of legal proceedings and rights that would have been difficult for Helen to comprehend. (“In a Flores bond hearing, an immigration judge reviews your case to determine whether you pose a danger to the community,” the document began.) On Helen’s form, which was filled out with assistance from officials, there is a checked box next to a line that says, “I withdraw my previous request for a Flores bond hearing.” Beneath that line, the five-year-old signed her name in wobbly letters.\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nAs the summer progressed with no signs of Helen’s return, Noehmi and Jeny contacted *LUPE*{:.small}, a nonprofit community union based in the Rio Grande Valley, to ask for help winning Helen’s release. Founded by the famed activists César Chávez and Dolores Huerta in 1989, *LUPE*{:.small} fights deportations, provides social services, and organizes civil mobilizations on behalf of more than eight thousand low-income members across south Texas; Jeny, employed as an office cleaner, was one such member. Tania Chavez, a strategy leader for the organization, met with the family to hear their story.\n\nHelen’s case didn’t fit the typical *LUPE*{:.small} mold. “Historically, we have served longtime residents of the Rio Grande Valley,” Chavez told me, “but since this new surge of refugees came about, we’ve been on the front lines of advocacy against family separation.” Freeing Helen struck Chavez as a tangible and urgent goal. “Right away, we said, ‘How do we help this little girl?’ ” she said. As Chavez saw it, the girl’s seizure by the government showed that the family-separation crisis hadn’t been resolved, as many Americans believed—it had simply evolved.\n\nThe first stage of the family-separation crisis unfolded largely out of public view, not long after Trump took office. By January, 2018, when I began collecting the stories of parents who had been separated from their children at the border, the government denied that these separations were happening without clear justifications, and insisted that they weren’t encouraged by official policy. In the late spring, the Secretary of Homeland Security, Kirstjen Nielsen, was still espousing this line, even as she ramped up “zero tolerance” prosecutions—criminally charging parents with “illegal entry,” and seizing their kids in the process. \n\nStage two of the crisis unfolded in the national spotlight. As the number of separations soared past two thousand, and their wrenching details surfaced, hundreds of thousands of Americans protested in the streets. Laura Bush said that the practice broke her heart. The American Academy of Pediatrics denounced it as “abhorrent,” noting that the approach could inflict long-term, irrevocable trauma on children. On June 20th, the President issued an executive order purporting to end the practice.\n\nNow stage three has commenced—one in which separations are done quietly, *LUPE*{:.small}’s Tania Chavez asserts, and in which reunifications can be mysteriously stymied. According to recent Department of Justice numbers—released because of an ongoing A.C.L.U. lawsuit challenging family separations—a hundred and thirty-six children who fall within the lawsuit’s scope are still in government custody. An uncounted number of separated children in shelters and foster care fall outside the lawsuit’s current purview—including many like Helen, who arrived with a grandparent or other guardian, rather than with a parent. Many such children have been misclassified, in government paperwork, as “unaccompanied minors,” due to a sloppy process that the Department of Homeland Security’s Office of the Inspector General recently critiqued. Chavez believes that, through misclassification, many kids have largely disappeared from public view, and from official statistics, with the federal government showing little urgency to hasten reunifications. (O.R.R. and U.S. Customs and Border Protection did not respond to requests for comment.)\n\nNoehmi and Jeny connected with *LUPE*{:.small}’s newly hired attorney, Eugene Delgado. Delgado had grown up in the Rio Grande Valley, a child of migrant workers. He left the region for a life in corporate law, practicing in New York and in the United Arab Emirates. But, when the family-separation crisis flooded the news this summer, he told me, “I wanted to help my community.” He moved back to McAllen and joined *LUPE*{:.small} to fight deportations full time. He agreed to represent Noehmi and her family, and at the summer’s end he went with them to court to represent them in removal proceedings. There, a judge granted Noehmi and her relatives more time to apply for asylum. Toward the end of the hearing, Delgado brought up Helen.\n\n“Judge, this case doesn’t stop here,” Delgado said. “What about the little child lost in the system?”\n\nThe judge looked confused. “What do you mean?” he asked.\n\n“Well, where is Helen, the five-year-old?”\n\nThe judge, Delgado recalled, seemed startled. Both he and the government prosecutor had no idea that Helen existed, let alone where she was being held. “I could give you a couple of phone numbers to call?” the prosecutor offered.\n\nDelgado began the search. “It was just a complete maze, trying to trace the girl down,” he recalled. “I talked to at least ten people—case workers, social workers.” Eventually, he learned of Helen’s placement in Baytown, the Houston shelter. After that, Noehmi and Jeny were allowed two ten-minute calls with Helen per week, during which the girl often pleaded, “Come get me, Grandma!” The government collected fingerprints and other information from Noehmi and Jeny, to determine whether they were Helen’s rightful guardians; the Office of Refugee Resettlement soon deemed Jeny a fit sponsor, Delgado told me, but the completion of Noehmi’s background check was delayed for unexplained reasons.\n\nOn August 17th, Helen was transferred to a foster home in San Antonio. “I feared, did they give Helen away?” Noehmi told me; she worried about the prospect of adoption. Delgado managed to arrange a supervised visit between Noehmi and her granddaughter. At the visit’s start, Helen was gleeful, shouting, “Grandma, you came to get me!” But the girl exhibited strange new behaviors that troubled Noehmi. “She kept hiding under the table,” Noehmi said. After an hour, the two were separated again; again, they both cried. A case worker offered Noehmi a chance to ride the elevator downstairs with Helen before the girl was taken away. Noehmi declined. “I took the stairs, so I could scream and cry,” she told me. But she raced down to meet Helen outside and hugged her one more time before Helen was loaded into a minivan and carted back to foster care.\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nBy the end of August, Noehmi felt desperate. She ate only a few spoonfuls of beef stew each day. Again, she sought hospitalization, for anxiety. “I was sick in the head,” she told me. Tania Chavez asked if the family wanted to escalate their tactics for getting Helen back. “People forget that family separation has been happening in our community for decades—it’s not a new thing,” Chavez told me, referencing the routine nature of deportations for mothers, fathers, and grandparents with deep Texas roots, and the children often left behind. Chavez had found, in these cases, that authorities sometimes responded to public pressure; she’d never tried this in family-separation cases, but it seemed worth a shot. Chavez reached out to Alida Garcia, the vice-president of advocacy for the group FWD.us, and Jess Morales Rocketto, the chair of an alliance known as Families Belong Together. These teams worked together to craft a national social-media campaign, using Helen’s O.R.R. case-file photograph: an image that eerily resembled a cherub-cheeked mug shot. On August 31st, they began to circulate a petition addressing the O.R.R. official in charge of Helen’s case. “By that Friday, we already had six hundred signatures,” Chavez said. Right away, they began receiving calls from O.R.R., promising that Helen would be returned to her family as soon as possible. There was simply a holdup with her grandmother’s fingerprint check, they said.\n\nOn September 7th, *LUPE*{:.small} was told that Helen would finally be released, nearly two months after she was taken from Noehmi. “We were attached to our phones all freaking Saturday,” Chavez said. “Then she wasn’t released—they played us!” *LUPE*{:.small}’s team adjusted the petition to address a greater number of O.R.R. officials, each of whom received a personal e-mail every time a person signed. Paola Mendoza, an artist and prominent voice for immigrant rights, tweeted about the petition, as did the actress Alyssa Milano. “We got six thousand signatures, then ten thousand,” Chavez said. Then, that Monday, Noehmi and Jeny got a phone call: they should be at their local airport at 6:20 *P.M.*{:.small}\n\nAt the airport, Noehmi breathlessly scanned the gates: nothing. Then, she heard a little voice cry out, “That’s my grandma! That’s my grandma!” Helen raced into her arms. “Is that my mom?” Helen asked. She hadn’t seen her mother since she was an infant. The whole family held one another, and then went home. Noehmi had prepared a surprise for Helen: a giant Teddy bear, a pizza party, a stack of new clothes, and a Disney princess castle with a “Mulan” theme (“She’s a princess fanatic,” Noehmi told me). \n\nSoon after, the shelter sent a small black backpack that Helen had left behind. It held Helen’s legal paperwork, including the document that the five-year-old had been told to sign, withdrawing her request to see a judge. The backpack also held Helen’s colored sketch of Lady Liberty. Beneath the statue’s image, a lesson summary, in Spanish, read, “Objective: That the students draw one of the most representative symbols of the United States.”\n\nLast Thursday, Helen’s family held another party, with cake and more princess gear, to celebrate the reunion and to thank the advocacy groups that helped make it happen. Chavez hoped that the party would also help the family’s healing. “Helen had resentment,” she said, “because I think she thought she was abandoned by her family.” \n\nJess Morales Rocketto, of Families Belong Together, told me that Helen’s reunion—the result of the first known public mobilization to free a specific kid from O.R.R. custody—holds lessons for a broader organizing effort. “One of the things Helen’s story really showed us is that the Trump Administration never stopped separating children from their families,” Morales Rocketto said. “In fact, they’ve doubled down, but it’s even more insidious now, because they are doing it in the cover of night.” She added, “We believe that there are more kids like Helen. We have learned we cannot take this Administration at their word.”\n\nNoehmi fears that some of the damage inflicted on her family can never be mended. “Helen was always a very calm girl,” she told me, sitting in *LUPE*{:.small}’s office on a recent Friday night. “Now I have to be very patient with her—she’s very attention-seeking.” Lately, at bedtime, Helen hides in the closet and refuses to go to sleep, afraid that her family might leave her in the night. Sometimes Noehmi wants to hide, too; she buried her round face in her hands, weeping, when she recounted one of Helen’s declarations upon her return: “You left me behind.” But Noehmi decided to share their story with me because she worries that other families are still living out a similar search. “I fear there are still other children suffering,” she said. “Other families are feeling this anguish, this struggle, and they need us to act.”\n\n----------\n\n*A document from July shows a checked box where Helen asserted her legal right to have her custody determination reviewed by a judge.*\n\n----------\n\n[#iframe: https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5000506-Stillman-Hellen-1.html](100%x800px)\n\n\n\n----------\n\n*Later, in August, officials assisted Helen in filling out a form—signed by the five-year-old, while separated from her family—withdrawing her request for a hearing before a judge. While in custody, she was also given crayons and asked to color patriotic images, including one of the Statue of Liberty.*\n\n----------\n\n[#iframe: https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5000507-Stillman-Hellen-2.html](100%x800px)","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"sections":[{"id":"590a02541c7a8e33fb390be1","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"590a02541c7a8e33fb390be1","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News Desk","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news-desk"},{"id":"5904126172dadf5d0a508800","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news"},{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"}],"name":"News Desk","parent":[{"id":"5904126172dadf5d0a508800","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"},"slug":"news-desk"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"web","contributors":[{"id":"590a02abc14b3c606c109f00","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Sarah Stillman is a staff writer at _The New Yorker._ She is also the director of the Global Migration Program at Columbia University’s Graduate School of Journalism, where she teaches a course on covering immigration and refugee issues.

Wednesday and call an end to his policy of separating migrant families detained at the southern border? It was clear from the start that the policy was cruel, heartless, and unnecessary. Although there has been a spike in the number of asylum seekers in recent months, the over-all number of undocumented immigrants coming into the United States from Mexico and other Latin American countries is significantly lower than it was a decade ago. There is no “crisis” at the southern border, except the humanitarian one of Trump’s own making. Trump’s picture of the United States being swamped—or, in his words, “infested”—by Latino migrants is a fantasy that he concocted to whip up the racial fears and antipathies of his core supporters.\n\nClearly, Trump didn’t make this U-turn because he had grown tired of fear-mongering and racial incitement, or because he had experienced a crisis of conscience. (It’s far from clear that he’s even capable of such a thing.) He reversed course because he had no choice politically. Although he often adopts the rhetoric and body language of an authoritarian strongman, he’s an elected politician. And in the face of mass outrage, bipartisan opposition, and condemnation from church groups and other civil-society institutions, the child-separation policy was no longer  sustainable. \n\nBut Trump didn’t reverse the policy of “zero tolerance” that his Administration introduced in May, which obliges immigration agents to arrest and detain anybody who crosses the border outside an official entry point. The [*Times*](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/20/us/politics/trump-immigration-children-executive-order.html) reported that the new executive order was designed “to get around an existing 1997 consent decree, known as the Flores settlement, that prohibits the federal government from keeping children in immigration detention—even if they are with their parents—for more than 20 days.” If Trump gets his way, families stopped at the border will now be detained indefinitely under the custody of *ICE*{: .small}. That is precisely the outcome that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit deemed illegal in a 2016 ruling about the Flores settlement.\n\nIn another alarming sign, on Wednesday evening, CBS News reported that despite Trump’s executive order the Department of Health & Human Services, which runs the child-detention centers, won’t make any special efforts to reunite the families that have already been split up, and that the separated children will be dealt with under the same processes that have been in effect since May.  Kenneth Wolfe, a spokesman for the Department, confirmed this to the *Times*, saying, “There will not be a grandfathering of existing cases.” (Later Wednesday night, the Department put out a statement saying its spokesman had “misspoke” and it was “awaiting further guidance on the matter.”) \n\nAt most, this was a very partial U-turn. If Trump’s executive order survives the inevitable legal challenges, which is far from certain, it will keep more than two thousand children away from their parents, and it could well lead to the creation of a chain of semi-permanent refugee camps on the southern border. Trump only went this far because he was facing a public-relations disaster and a rebellion from Republicans fearful of losing control of Congress in the midterms.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Senate Majority Leader, Mitch McConnell, until now Trump’s faithful enabler on Capitol Hill, stated publicly that he and his fellow Republican Senators were in agreement that the child-separation policy “needs to be fixed.” On Wednesday morning, Paul Ryan, the Speaker of the House, said that on Thursday the lower chamber would “vote on legislation to keep families together.” In the past year and a half, congressional Republicans have demonstrated that there is little they won’t do to abase themselves before Trump, if it means getting the policy results they desire. But even usually  gutless pro-Trump Republicans weren’t willing to enter a campaign season defending a policy of tearing infants from their parents and keeping them detained in tents and metal cages.\n\nA Quinnipiac University opinion poll that was released earlier this week indicated that Americans opposed the child-separation policy by an overwhelming margin, more than two to one. Only a majority of Republicans supported the policy. As *The Atlantic’s* Ronald Brownstein pointed out, [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/RonBrownstein/status/1009483547306962944), white, non-college-educated white women, a key voting group for the G.O.P., were opposed to the policy by the whopping margin of fifty-six per cent to thirty per cent. And this poll was taken before the latest reports and pictures from inside the child-detention centers. \n\nWhen Trump went up to Capitol Hill on Tuesday night to meet with House Republicans, he was sticking  to the fallacious line that only Congress could fix the problem. Less than twenty-four hours later,  he finally dropped this pretense. “We are going to be signing an executive order in a little while,” he said at the White House, at lunchtime on Wednesday. “We’re gonna keep families together. But we still have to maintain toughness, or our country will be overrun by people, by crime, by all of the things that we don’t stand for, that we don’t want.” \n\nThis statement, and similar ones he made later in the day, indicated that he intends to stick with his campaign theme of targeting undocumented immigrants, and depicting them as base creatures who could “infest” the United States. The political crisis is by no means over, nor is the migrant crisis. Until the children in the detention camps are reunited with their parents, and a reasonable system is reinstituted for dealing with families detained at the border, there is no cause for celebration. \n\n +++inset-right\n\n[#externallink: /externallinks/5b2d043f87016730a4fd0ea7]||||||\n\n+++\n\nBut at least Trump has been forced to retreat on one political front. And for that we have to thank the media, some civic and religious institutions, and the conscience of the American public. After Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced the zero-tolerance policy, in May, the number of children who were separated from their parents quickly grew. Civil-rights groups monitored the situation, and the news media began to focus on it. Before long, some religious leaders expressed concerns, and so did some elected politicians, including Senator Jeff Merkley, Democrat of Oregon, who tried to visit a detention center in Brownsville, Texas, but got turned away. \n\nAs public outrage  mounted, the policy turned into a major news story. Eventually, some media organizations obtained shocking pictures from inside the detention centers, and one, ProPublica, [posted an audiotape](https://www.propublica.org/article/children-separated-from-parents-border-patrol-cbp-trump-immigration-policy) of young children crying for their parents, and an immigration agent joking about it, saying, “Well, we have an orchestra here.” In the face of these stories, all of the Trump Administration’s rationalizations, deceptions, and outright lies couldn’t hide the fact that it was carrying out an iniquitous and indefensible policy. This was real news, not fake news, and, ultimately, it forced Trump to back down.  \n\n*This post was updated to include the statement issued Wednesday night by the Department of Health & Human Services.*","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"sections":[{"id":"59ef6620c6604764e97c762c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Our Columnists","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"our-columnists"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5909e8fb8b51cf59fc4246ae","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"John Cassidy has been a staff writer at *The New Yorker* since 1995.

The pair had been split up as a consequence of the Trump Administration’s [zero-tolerance policy](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-the-trump-administration-got-comfortable-separating-immigrant-kids-from-their-parents) at the border, which calls for the criminal prosecution of all migrants, including asylum seekers, who cross the border without turning themselves in to officials at so-called ports of entry. Now the father was in an immigration-detention facility in Arizona, awaiting deportation. He had no idea where his child was. Kephart was put on the case after the father called his family, back in a small town outside of Huehuetenango City, in Guatemala’s western highlands, and his family, in turn, contacted a local nonprofit that works with Kids in Need of Defense. \n\nEvery undocumented immigrant who enters government custody is assigned what’s called an alien number. But the girl’s family didn’t know hers. Armed with only the girl’s name and birth date, Kephart dialed a 1-800 hotline set up by the Office of Refugee Resettlement (O.R.R.), the federal body in charge of handling unaccompanied immigrant children. This hotline, Kephart told me, is difficult to access for parents who are in a detention facility (hold times can last half an hour; it’s impossible to leave a call-back number) or who have been deported (international calls are expensive, and 1-800 numbers don’t often work from abroad).\n\n“We hit a dead end,” Kephart said. “The person I spoke with just made a note in the file of the girl they thought it might be. But we didn’t get confirmation that we were talking about the same child. They were looking at the record of someone whose first name was spelled differently, and whose date of birth was a month off.”\n\nIn the past two months, the government has taken some two thousand immigrant children away from their parents. Under the zero-tolerance policy, border crossers are arrested and charged with a crime before being placed in immigration detention. If they came with their children, the children are turned over to O.R.R. and treated as though they travelled to the U.S. alone. No protocols have been put in place for keeping track of parents and children concurrently, for keeping parents and children in contact with each other while they are separated, or for eventually reuniting them. Immigration lawyers, public defenders, and advocates along the border have been trying to fill the void.\n\nKephart had one other lead. The family in Guatemala had the phone number of a children’s shelter run by O.R.R. where they thought that the girl might be. The number had come from a neighbor who had also been separated from a child in the U.S. When Kephart called that shelter, she was told that the girl wasn’t there but that someone with a similar name and date of birth might be at a facility nearby. Eventually, Kephart tracked down a case manager at the second facility. “I told her, ‘Look, I have this situation. I think you have a girl there,’&nbsp;” Kephart told me. “The case manager said, ‘Oh, my God, yes!’ The case manager had a kid whose parents she couldn’t find. She was trying to help, but she’d had nothing to go on.”\n\nAlthough the zero-tolerance policy was officially announced last month, it has been in effect, in more limited form, since at least last summer. Several months ago, as cases of family separation started surfacing across the country, immigrant-rights groups began calling for the Department of Homeland Security (D.H.S.), which is in charge of immigration enforcement and border security, to create procedures for tracking families after they are split up. At the time, D.H.S. said that it would address the problem, but there is no evidence that it actually did so. Erik Hanshew, a federal public defender in El Paso, told me that the problems begin at the moment of arrest. “Our client gets arrested with his or her child out in the field. Sometimes they go together at the initial processing, sometimes they get separated right then and there for separate processing,” he said. “When we ask the Border Patrol agents at detention hearings a few days after physical arrest about the information they’ve obtained in their investigation, they tell us that the only thing they know is that the person arrested was with a kid. They don’t seem to know gender, age, or name.” \n\nJennifer Podkul, who is the policy director of Kids in Need of Defense, told me that advocates are trying to piece together information about the whereabouts of children based on the federal charging documents used in the parent’s immigration case. “You can try to figure out where and when the child was apprehended based on that,” she said. “But where the child is being held often has nothing to do with where she and her parent were arrested. The kids get moved around to different facilities.” \n\n +++inset-right\n\n[#externallink: /externallinks/5b2d043f87016730a4fd0ea7]||||||\n\n+++\n\nThe federal departments involved in dealing with separated families have institutional agendas that diverge. Immigration and Customs Enforcement—the agency at the D.H.S. that handles immigrant parents—is designed to deport people as rapidly as it can, while O.R.R.—the office within the Department of Health and Human Services (H.H.S.) that assumes custody of the kids—is designed to release children to sponsor or foster families in the U.S. Lately, O.R.R. has been moving more slowly than usual, which has resulted in parents getting deported before their children’s cases are resolved. There’s next to no coördination between D.H.S. and H.H.S. “*ICE*{:.small} detainees are not allowed to receive calls, so any calls need to be individually arranged,” Michelle Brané, of the Women’s Refugee Commission, told me. “A phone call is not a fix for separation. It is a call, often with a very young child. A call is a Band-Aid.” A number of lawyers that I’ve spoken with described personally pressuring individual deportation officers to delay a parent’s deportation until she can be reunified with her child or, failing that, until children and parents can be deported at roughly the same time. \n\nLate last week, Kephart heard that the Guatemalan family had at last learned where the young girl was. A month after they’d been separated, though, it still wasn’t clear that the father had been informed in detention of his daughter’s location. “I hope that she’s spoken to her father,” Kephart told me. “But I haven’t gotten confirmation yet.” Even if father and daughter have spoken, getting reunited is far from assured. There is no formal process in place to insure that a family that’s been separated at the border gets deported back to their home country together. For now, just knowing the whereabouts of a child is a start. “I have a master’s degree, and I’m fluent in English,” Kephart said. “And it takes me days to figure one of these cases out.”","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"sections":[{"id":"590a02541c7a8e33fb390be1","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News Desk","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news-desk"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"590a0738fba4e90c8d8d92ff","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Jonathan Blitzer is a staff writer at *The New Yorker*.

The policy, which called for the criminal prosecution of anyone crossing the border illegally, and led to the separation of more than twenty-five hundred children from their parents, has coincided with a broader effort to [dismantle](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-trump-administration-is-completely-unraveling-the-us-asylum-system) the U.S. asylum system. Yet the government [never had a plan](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-government-has-no-plan-for-reuniting-the-immigrant-families-it-is-tearing-apart) for keeping track of the separated parents and children once they were in custody, and, even after a federal judge in San Diego, Dana Sabraw, ordered the government to reunite them, it [struggled](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-activist-effort-to-find-the-children-that-the-government-took-from-their-parents) to comply. “I definitely haven’t seen contrition,” an Administration official, who told me about the weekly meetings, said. “But there was frustration with the incompetence of how zero tolerance got implemented. From the perspective of the political leaders here, there’s recognition of how badly the policy failed.” The lesson, according to the official, didn’t seem to be that the Administration had gone too far in separating families but, rather, that “we need to be smarter if we want to implement something on this scale” again.\n\nThe meetings—which, the official said, were first called by a team at the White House that reports directly to Stephen Miller, the President’s senior adviser on policy—include representatives from the Department of Justice, the Office of Management and Budget, the Department of Defense, and the Department of Homeland Security. The main focus, the official added, has been to “map out” how the government can detain asylum seekers as they wait for a hearing before an immigration judge, which can take several months: “The job is to model all the steps in the process. If we go after families, where do we detain them? What are the resources required at each step?” (While officials from the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice declined to comment on the meetings, a spokesperson for the Department of Defense said in a statement that “the Department of Defense participates in many border planning meetings with DHS, CBP, and other federal partners,” adding that it “has also been asked by DHS and HHS”—the Department of Health and Human Services—“to plan for potential sheltering of family units and unaccompanied children on military installations.“)\n\nIn the next week, officials are planning to generate a first round of proposals, which is expected to include projections such as how many beds might be needed in detention centers and children’s shelters, as well as how many additional immigration judges and asylum officers should be hired to keep the system moving. The official told me that the proposals need not be restricted by existing federal laws and court agreements, such as the Flores settlement, which provides protections for the treatment of immigrant children in custody and guidelines on how long they can be detained. (The Administration is also trying to [rewrite](https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/nation/2018/05/09/dhs-proposal-would-change-rules-for-minors-immigration-detention/cPjW3GwlCa9XFa7QzRnr5K/story.html) the terms of the Flores settlement.) It is all part of a “planning exercise,” in which the participants are encouraged to explore any option to end the “catch and release” of asylum seekers.\n\nSuch boldness doesn’t exactly come as a surprise. To date, no one in the Trump Administration has been held accountable for its family-separation policy, even after evidence has steadily mounted as to its immense human costs and [administrative failures](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/social-issues/deleted-families-what-went-wrong-with-trumps-family-separation-effort/2018/07/28/54bcdcc6-90cb-11e8-8322-b5482bf5e0f5_story.html). The government’s own data show that it has had no appreciable effect on migration patterns throughout the summer, but the Administration pursued the policy anyway, targeting immigrant families. Zero tolerance was designed for the government to criminally prosecute all migrants who crossed the border illegally, yet, in May, less than a third of those arrested by Border Patrol were referred to the Department of Justice for prosecution, and a significant number of those referrals involved parents who crossed the border with their children. For years, there has been frustration among federal immigration authorities who felt that parents were taking advantage of laxer enforcement at the border when they travelled to the United States with their children. There are certainly flaws in the system, but the zero-tolerance policy was intended to send a message of unprecedented harshness. According to a [report](http://trac.syr.edu/immigration/reports/520/) by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, at Syracuse University, “The Administration has not explained its rationale for prosecuting parents with children when that left so many other adults without children who were not being referred for prosecution.” Michelle Brané, of the Women’s Refugee Commission, told me, “It’s still baffling to me that no one has had to answer for this.”\n\nSo who is to blame, and will there be any accountability? The family-separation policy raised questions about Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which is responsible for the [treatment of parents](https://www.vox.com/2018/7/29/17626588/separated-families-lawsuit-deport-ice) in detention, and the Department of Health and Human Services, which is tasked with caring for the [separated children](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/scott-lloyd-refugee-resettlement_us_5b58cd0fe4b0fd5c73cb3c1a). But, a former government official told me, the prime movers behind zero tolerance were members of a “cabal of anti-immigration guys” at the White House, the D.H.S., and the Department of Justice. Stephen Miller and a Justice Department adviser named Gene Hamilton led the discussion, the former official said. “They want to have a different America, and they’re succeeding. Now they’re doubling down—they’re making another run at lowering the number of refugees who are admitted to the United States.” The failure of the zero-tolerance policy has done little, if anything, to diminish the group’s standing; on the contrary, Miller has only seemed to [gain](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/01/us/politics/trump-refugees-reduction.html) allies in the government. Within the President’s inner circle, according to the [*Times*](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/28/us/politics/jared-ivanka-trump.html), he is considered a “walking policy encyclopedia” on immigration. \n\nDespite the public outcry over family separation, Customs and Border Protection, which is in charge of immigration enforcement at the border, has been largely overlooked, perhaps because it’s been upstaged by the notoriety of *ICE*{:.small}, its better-known institutional sibling. But decisions about whom the government would refer for prosecution were made by officials at C.B.P., and it was Border Patrol agents at C.B.P., not *ICE*{:.small} officers, who [took](https://www.newyorker.com/news/dispatch/in-ice-detention-a-honduran-woman-fears-deportation-without-her-son) children [from their parents’ arms](https://www.newyorker.com/news/dispatch/in-ice-detention-a-honduran-woman-fears-deportation-without-her-son). During the summer, the commissioner of the agency, Kevin McAleenan, [denied](http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-border-patrol-immigration-20180611-htmlstory.html) that the Trump Administration was deliberately separating families, even as he directed implementation of a policy doing just that. In late June, just days after Sabraw ordered the government to reunite the separated families, [Kirstjen Nielsen](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-dhs-secretary-kirstjen-nielsen-became-one-of-president-trumps-fiercest-loyalists), the head of D.H.S., made an announcement. Ronald Vitiello, the deputy commissioner of C.B.P. and a law-enforcement veteran, was tapped to replace Thomas Homan as the director of *ICE*{:.small}. I was in El Paso just before the news broke, when I received a text message from an *ICE*{:.small} officer: “From the frying pan to the fire.” \n\nSome five hundred and sixty children are still separated from their parents, including twenty-four who are five years old or younger, and the parents of more than three hundred and sixty of them have already been deported. Between seven hundred and eight hundred other children were reunited with their parents in detention, where their situation is especially confounding. About half of the reunited parents have final orders of deportation—in many instances, because they’d been [pressured](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/immigrant-parents-face-a-dilemma-will-making-an-asylum-claim-make-it-harder-to-reunite-with-their-kids) to sign papers waiving their rights to pursue their immigration cases. As a result, families face a choice: either a parent and child can agree to be deported together, or the child can stay in this country alone while her own case is decided. Last Thursday night, Sabraw issued an order [temporarily blocking](https://www.vox.com/2018/8/17/17714918/children-separated-parents-deport-asylum) the deportation of reunited parents so that they could have more time to weigh their legal options with immigration lawyers. As Dara Lind wrote, at [Vox](https://www.vox.com/2018/8/17/17714918/children-separated-parents-deport-asylum), “The question right now is *when* they will actually be deported, not *whether* they will be.”  \n\nI asked the current Administration official whether the outcry over family separation had caught the government by surprise. It had, the official said. “The expectation was that the kids would go to the Office of Refugee Resettlement, that the parents would get deported, and that no one would care.” Yet, when it became clear that the public did, the Administration chose not to change course.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"sections":[{"id":"5907f159ebe912338a3717d7","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Daily Comment","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"daily-comment"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"590a0738fba4e90c8d8d92ff","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Jonathan Blitzer is a staff writer at *The New Yorker*.
