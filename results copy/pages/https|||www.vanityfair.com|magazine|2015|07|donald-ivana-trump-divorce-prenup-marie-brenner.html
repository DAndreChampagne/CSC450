118-room winter palace in Palm Beach. “Our custom is to go around the table after dinner and introduce ourselves to each other.” Trump had seemed fidgety that night, understandably eager to move the dinner party along so that he could go to bed.</p><p data-reactid="219">“Old custom? He’s only had Mrs. Post’s house a few months. Really! I’m going home,” one Palm Beach resident whispered to his date.</p><p data-reactid="220">“Oh, stay,” she said. “It will be so amusing.”</p><p data-reactid="221">It was spring, four years ago. Donald and Ivana Trump were seated at opposite ends of their long Sheraton table in Mrs. Marjorie Merriweather Post’s former dining room. They were posed in imperial style, as if they were a king and queen. They were at the height of their ride, and it was plenty glorious. Trump was seen on the news shows offering his services to negotiate with the Russians. There was talk that he might make a run for president. Ivana had had so much publicity that she now offered interviewers a press kit of flattering clips. Anything seemed possible, the Trumps had grown to such stature in the golden city of New York.</p><div id="AMS_VYF_INLINE_TEXT" class="component-consumer-marketing cm-unit article-in-text-mobile-cm-container"><div class="component-consumer-marketing-failsafe cm-failsafe"><div class="component-lazy loaded" data-component="Lazy"><a href="https://subscribe.vanityfair.com/subscribe/splits/vanityfair/VYF_FAILSAFE?source=FAILSAFE" target="_blank"><div class="component-in-article-cm"><span class="component-in-article-cm__hed"><!-- react-text: 718 -->Try <!-- /react-text --><em>Vanity Fair</em><!-- react-text: 720 --> and receive a free tote.<!-- /react-text --></span><span class="component-in-article-cm__cta">Join Now</span></div></a></div></div></div><div id="AMS_VYF_INLINE_TEXT" class="component-consumer-marketing cm-unit article-in-text-tablet-cm-container"><div class="component-consumer-marketing-failsafe cm-failsafe"><div class="component-lazy loaded" data-component="Lazy"><a href="https://subscribe.vanityfair.com/subscribe/splits/vanityfair/VYF_FAILSAFE?source=FAILSAFE" target="_blank"><div class="component-in-article-cm"><span class="component-in-article-cm__hed"><!-- react-text: 728 -->Try <!-- /react-text --><em>Vanity Fair</em><!-- react-text: 730 --> and receive a free tote.<!-- /react-text --></span><span class="component-in-article-cm__cta">Join Now</span></div></a></div></div></div><div id="AMS_VYF_INLINE_TEXT" class="component-consumer-marketing cm-unit article-in-text-desktop-cm-container"><div id="cns-ads-slot-type-ams-vyf-inline-text-0" class="cns-ads-stage cns-ads-slot-type-ams-vyf-inline-text cns-ads-slot-type-ams-vyf-inline-text-0 cns-ads-slot-state-filled cns-ads-slot-size-793x74" data-name="AMS_VYF_INLINE_TEXT_0" data-slot-type="AMS_VYF_INLINE_TEXT" style="font-size: 0px; line-height: 0; overflow: hidden; left: 0px; right: 0px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><div id="AMS_VYF_INLINE_TEXT_0" class="cns-ads-container" data-ad-seq="0" data-google-query-id="CKfbld-fot4CFUj0ZAodUwkGYg" style="margin: 0px auto; box-sizing: content-box; height: 74px; min-height: 74px; width: 100%; min-width: 793px;"><div id="google_ads_iframe_3379/vanityfair.cm/news_5__container__" style="border: 0pt none; margin: auto; text-align: center; height: 74px; min-height: 74px; width: 793px; min-width: 793px;"><iframe id="google_ads_iframe_3379/vanityfair.cm/news_5" title="3rd party ad content" name="google_ads_iframe_3379/vanityfair.cm/news_5" width="793" height="74" scrolling="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" frameborder="0" srcdoc="" style="border: 0px; vertical-align: bottom; height: 74px; min-height: 74px; width: 793px; min-width: 793px;" data-load-complete="true"></iframe></div></div></div><div class="component-consumer-marketing-failsafe cm-failsafe"><div class="component-lazy pending" data-component="Lazy"></div></div></div><p data-reactid="225">It was balmy that night in Palm Beach; Ivana wore a strapless dress. The air was redolent with the fragrance of oleander and bougainvillea, mingled with the slight smell of mildew which clung to the old house. To his credit, Trump had no interest in mastering the Palm Beach style of navy blazers and linen trousers. Often he wore a business suit to his table; his only concession to local custom was to wear a pink tie or pale shoes. To her credit, Ivana still served the dinners her husband preferred, so on that warm night the guests ate beef with potatoes. Mrs. Post’s faux-Tiepolo ceiling remained in the dining room, but an immense silver bowl now rested in the center of the table, filled with plastic fruit. As always, it was business with the Trumps, for that was their common purpose, the bond between them. In recent years, they never seemed to touch each other or exchange intimate remarks in public. They had become less like man and wife and more like two ambassadors from different countries, each with a separate agenda.</p><p data-reactid="226">The Trumps had bought Mar-a-Lago only a few months earlier, but already they had become Palm Beach curiosities. Across the road was the Bath and Tennis Club, “the B and T,” as the locals called it, and it was said that the Trumps had yet to be invited to join. “Utter bullshit! They kiss my ass in Palm Beach,” Trump told me recently. “Those phonies! That club called me and asked me if they could have my consent to use part of my beach to expand the space for their cabanas! I said, ‘Of course!’ Do you think if I wanted to be a member they would have turned me down? I wouldn’t join that club, because they don’t take blacks and Jews.”</p><p data-reactid="227">As if Mar-a-Lago and the <em>Trump Princess</em> yacht were James Gatz’s West Egg estate, invitations were much prized, for the local snobs loved to dine out on tales of the Trumps. And now this! Embarrassing their guests by having them make speeches, as if they were at a sales convention!</p><p data-reactid="228">When it was Ivana’s turn to introduce herself that night, she rose quickly. “I am married to the most <em>wonderful</em> husband. He is so generous and smart. We are so lucky to have this life.” She was desperately playing to him, but Donald said nothing in return. He seemed tired of hearing Ivana’s endless praise; her subservient quality appeared to be getting to him. Perhaps he was spoiling for something to excite him, like a fight. Maybe all the public posturing was beginning to get boring, too. “Well, I’m done,” he said before dessert, tossing his napkin on the table and vanishing from the room.</p><p data-reactid="229">Palm Beach had been Ivana Trump’s idea. Long ago, Donald had screamed at her, “I want nothing social that you aspire to. If that is what makes you happy, get another husband!” But she had no intention of doing that, for Ivana, like Donald, was living out a fantasy. She had seen that in the Trump life everything and everybody appeared to come with a price, or a marker for future use. Ivana had learned to look through Donald with glazed eyes when he said to close friends, as he had in the early years of their marriage, “I would never buy Ivana any decent jewels or pictures. Why give her negotiable assets?” She had gotten out of Eastern Europe by being tough and highly disciplined, and she had compounded her skills through her husband, the master manipulator. She had learned the lingua franca in a world where everyone seemed to be using everyone else in a relentless drive for power. How was she to know that there was another way to live? Besides, she often told her friends, however cruel Donald could be, she was very much in love with him.</p><p data-reactid="230">This night Ivana had managed to wedge in the publisher of the local social paper, “the Shiny Sheet.” As usual, Donald’s weekend guests were paybacks, for he trusted few people. He had invited one of his construction executives, the mayor of West Palm Beach, and the former governor of New York, Hugh Carey, who in his days running the state as “Society Carey,” boosted by huge Trump donations, had been crucial to Trump’s early success.</p><p data-reactid="231">For years, Ivana appeared to have studied the public behavior of the royals. Her friends now called this “Ivana’s imperial-couple syndrome,” and they teased her about it, for they knew that Ivana, like Donald, was inventing and reinventing herself all the time. When she had first come to New York, she wore elaborate helmet hairdos and bouffant satin dresses, very Hollywood; her image of rich American women probably came from the movies she had seen as a child. Ivana had now spent years passing through the fine rooms of New York, but she had never seemed to learn the real way of the truly rich, the art of understatement. Instead, she had become regal, filling her houses with the kind of ormolu found in palaces in Eastern Europe. She had taken to waving to friends with tiny hand motions, as if to conserve her energy. At her own charity receptions, she insisted that she and Donald form a receiving line, and she would stand in pinpoint heels, never sinking into the deep grass—such was her control.</p><p data-reactid="232">This spring night, a squad of servants had been outside to greet the guests, as if they had arrived at Cliveden between the wars. Most of the staff, however, were not a permanent part of Mar-a-Lago; they were local caterers and car parks, hired for the evening. In addition to the dining-room ceiling, Ivana had left Mrs. Post’s shabby fringed sofas and Moroccan suites totally in place, giving the impression that she was trying on Mrs. Post’s persona too. One of the few signs of the new owners’ taste was the dozens of silver frames on the many end tables. The frames did not contain family pictures, but magazine covers. Each cover featured the face of Donald Trump.</p><p data-reactid="233">When the Trump plane landed in Palm Beach, two cars were usually waiting, the first a Rolls-Royce for the adults, the second a station wagon for the children, the nannies, and a bodyguard. Occasionally, state troopers were on hand to speed the Trump motorcade along. This took a certain amount of planning and coordination, but the effort was crucial for what Ivana was trying to achieve. “In fifty years Donald and I will be considered old money like the Vanderbilts,” she once told the writer Dominick Dunne.</p></section><section class="content-section" data-reactid="234"><p data-reactid="235">This past April, when his empire was in danger of collapse, Trump isolated himself in a small apartment on a lower floor of Trump Tower. He would lie on his bed, staring at the ceiling, talking into the night on the telephone. The Trumps had separated. Ivana remained upstairs in the family triplex with its beige onyx floors and low-ceilinged living room painted with murals in the style of Michelangelo. The murals had occasioned one of their frequent fights: Ivana wanted cherubs, Donald preferred warriors. The warriors won. “If this were on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, it would be very much in place in terms of quality,” Trump once said of the work. That April, Ivana began to tell her friends that she was worried about Donald’s state of mind.</p><p data-reactid="236">She had been completely humiliated by Donald through his public association with Marla Maples. “How can you say you love us? You don’t love us! You don’t even love yourself. You just love your money,” twelve-year-old Donald junior told his father, according to friends of Ivana’s. “What kind of son have I created?” Trump’s mother, Mary, is said to have asked Ivana.</p><p data-reactid="237">However unlikely it seemed, Ivana was now considered a tabloid heroine, and her popularity seemed in inverse proportion to the fickle city’s new dislike of her husband. “Ivana is now a media goddess on par with Princess Di, Madonna, and Elizabeth Taylor,” Liz Smith reported. Months earlier, Ivana had undergone cosmetic reconstruction with a California doctor. She emerged unrecognizable to her friends and perhaps her children, as fresh and innocent of face as Heidi of Edelweiss Farms. Although she had negotiated four separate marital-property agreements over the last fourteen years, she was suing her husband for half his assets. Trump was trying to be philosophical. “When a man leaves a woman, especially when it was perceived that he has left for a piece of ass—a good one!—there are 50 percent of the population who will love the woman who was left,” he told me.</p><div id="cns-ads-slot-type-article-in-text-0" class="cns-ads-stage cns-ads-slot-type-article-in-text cns-ads-slot-type-article-in-text-0" data-name="article_in_text_0" data-slot-type="article_in_text" style="font-size: 0px; line-height: 0; overflow: hidden;"><div id="article_in_text_0" class="cns-ads-container" data-ad-seq="0" style="margin: 0px auto; box-sizing: content-box;"></div></div><p data-reactid="238">Ivana had hired a public-relations man to help her in her new role. “This is all very calculated,” one of her advisers told me. “Ivana is very shrewd. She’s playing it to the hilt.”</p><p data-reactid="239">Many floors beneath the Trumps, Japanese tourists roamed the Trump Tower lobby with their cameras. Inevitably, they took pictures of the display of Trump’s familiar portrait from the cover of his book <em>Trump: The Art of the Deal</em>, which was propped on an easel outside the Trump Tower real-estate office. The Japanese still took Donald Trump to be the very image of power and money, and seemed to believe, as Trump once had, that this red-marble-and-brass monument was the center of the world.</p><p data-reactid="240">For days, Trump rarely left his building. Hamburgers and French fries were sent up to him from the nearby New York Delicatessen. His body ballooned, his hair curled down his neck. “You remind me of Howard Hughes,” a friend told him. “Thanks,” Trump replied, “I admire him.” On the telephone he sounded ebullient, without a care, as confident as the image he projected in his lobby portrait.</p><p data-reactid="241">Like John Connally, the former governor of Texas, Trump had millions of dollars signed away in personal guarantees. The personal debt on the Trump Shuttle alone was $135 million. Bear Stearns had been guaranteed $56 million for Trump’s Alexander’s and American Airlines positions. The Taj Mahal casino had a complicated set of provisions which made Trump responsible for $35 million. Trump had personally guaranteed $125 million for the Plaza hotel. In West Palm Beach, Trump Plaza was so empty it was nicknamed “the Trump See-Through.” That building alone carried $14 million worth of personal debt. Trump’s mansions in Greenwich and Palm Beach, as well as the yacht, had been promised to the banks for $40 million in outstanding loans. <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> estimated that Trump’s guarantees could exceed $600 million. In one astonishing decade, Donald Trump had become the Brazil of Manhattan.</p><div data-reactid="242"><div class="embed cneembed"><div style="box-sizing:content-box;display:inline-block;height:0px;padding-top:56.25%;position:relative;transition:height 300ms ease-in-out;vertical-align:top;width:100%;" class="cne-player-container" id="4fede314-2fc6-d8b9-1d7f-a76a4aa3c501"><iframe style="height:1px !important;left:0px;min-height:100%;min-width:100%;position:absolute;top:0px;width:1px !important;" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="true" msallowfullscreen="true" allowtransparency="true" title="Video Player"></iframe></div><script type="text/javascript" async="" src="//player.cnevids.com/script/video/56749b2dff2afb22c600000d.js?autoplay=1&amp;muted=1" class="processed"></script><div class="embed block cneembed" data-url="//player.cnevids.com/script/video/56749b2dff2afb22c600000d.js?autoplay=1&amp;muted=1"></div></div></div></section><section class="content-section" data-reactid="243"><p data-reactid="244">“Anybody who is anybody sits between the columns. The food is the worst, but you’ll see everybody here,” Donald Trump told me ten years ago at the “21” Club. Donald had already cut a swath in this preserve of the New York establishment; we were immediately seated between the columns in the old upstairs room, then decorated with black paneling and red Naugahyde banquettes. It was the autumn of 1980, a fine season in New York. The Yankees were in the pennant race; a movie star was running for president and using the term “deregulation” in his campaign. Donald was new then, thirty-four years old and very brash, just beginning to make copy and loving it. He was already fodder for the dailies and the weeklies, but he was desperate for national attention. “Did you see that <em>The New York Times</em> said I looked like Robert Redford?” he asked me.</p><p data-reactid="245">Trump hasn’t changed much physically in the last ten years. Then, as now, he was all cheeks and jaw, with a tendency to look soft in the middle. He retains the blond hair, youthful swagger, and elastic face that give him the quality of the cartoon tough Baby Huey. Trump is a head swiveler, always looking around to see who else is in the room. As a boy, he was equally restless. “Donald was the child who would throw the cake at the birthday parties,” his brother Robert once told me. “If I built the bricks up, Donald would come along and glue them all together, and that would be the end of my bricks.”</p><p data-reactid="246">He was already married to Ivana, a former model and athlete from Czechoslovakia. One night in 1976, Trump had been at the bar in Maxwell’s Plum. Maxwell’s Plum is gone now, but the very name evokes the era of frantic singles underneath the Art Nouveau ceiling. It was the place where flight attendants hoped to find bankers, and models looked for dates. Donald met his model, Ivana Zelnickova, visiting from Montreal. She liked to tell the story of how she had gone skiing with Donald, pretending to be a learner like him, and then humiliated him by whizzing past him down the slopes.</p><p data-reactid="247">They were married in New York during Easter of 1977. Mayor Beame attended the wedding at Marble Collegiate Church. Donald had already made his alliance with Roy Cohn, who would become his lawyer and mentor. Shortly before the wedding, Donald reportedly told Ivana, “You have to sign this agreement.” “What is this?” she asked. “Just a document that will protect my family money.” Cohn gallantly offered to find Ivana a lawyer. “We don’t have these documents in Czechoslovakia,” Ivana reportedly said, but she told friends that she was terrified of Cohn and his power over Donald. The first agreement gave Ivana $20,000 a year. Two years later, Trump had made his own fortune. “You better redo the agreement, Donald,” Cohn reportedly told him. “Otherwise you’re going to look hard and greedy.” Ivana resisted. “You don’t like it, stick to the old agreement,” Trump is said to have replied.</p><p data-reactid="248">Donald was determined to have a large family. “I want five children, like in my own family, because with five, then I will know that one will be guaranteed to turn out like me,” Donald told a close friend. He was willing to be generous with Ivana, and a story went around that he was giving her a cash bonus of $250,000 for each child.</p><p data-reactid="249">The Trumps and their baby, Donald junior, lived in a Fifth Avenue apartment decorated with beige velvet sectional sofas and a bone-and-goatskin table from the Italian furniture store Casa Bella. They had a collection of Steuben glass animals which they displayed on glass shelves in the front hall. The shelves were outlined with a string of tiny white lights usually seen on a Christmas tree.</p><p data-reactid="250">Donald was trying to make time in the world of aesthetes and little black cocktail dresses. He had just completed the Grand Hyatt, on East Forty-second Street, and was considered a comer. He had put together the Fifth Avenue parcel that would become Trump Tower and had enraged the city establishment with his demolition of the cherished Art Deco friezes that had decorated the Bonwit Teller building. Even then, Trump’s style was to turn on his audience.</p><p data-reactid="251">“What do you think? Do you think blowing up the sculptures has hurt me?” he asked me that day at “21.”</p><p data-reactid="252">“Yes.”</p><p data-reactid="253">“Who cares?” he said. “Let’s say that I had given that junk to the Met. They would have just put them in their basement. I’ll never have the goodwill of the Establishment, the tastemakers of New York. Do you think, if I failed, these guys in New York would be unhappy? They would be thrilled! Because they have never tried anything on the scale that I am trying things in this city. I don’t care about their goodwill.”</p><p data-reactid="254">Donald was like an overgrown kid, all rough edges and inflated ego. He had brought the broad style of Brooklyn and Queens into Manhattan, flouting what he considered effete conventions, such as landmark preservation. His suits were badly cut, with wide cuffs on his trousers; he was a shade away from cigars. “I don’t put on any airs,” he told me. He tooled around New York in a silver Cadillac with “DJT” plates and tinted windows and had a former city cop for his driver.</p><p data-reactid="255">Donald and I were not alone at lunch that day. He had invited Stanley Friedman to join us. Friedman was a partner of Roy Cohn’s and, like Cohn, a legend in the city. He was part of the Bronx political machine, and would soon be appointed the Bronx County leader. Later, Friedman would go to jail for his role in the city parking-meter scandal. Trump and Friedman spent most of our lunch swapping stories about Roy Cohn. “Roy could fix anyone in the city,” Friedman told me. “He’s a genius.” “He’s a lousy lawyer, but he’s a genius,” Trump said.</p><div id="cns-ads-slot-type-article-in-text-1" class="cns-ads-stage cns-ads-slot-type-article-in-text cns-ads-slot-type-article-in-text-1" data-name="article_in_text_1" data-slot-type="article_in_text" style="font-size: 0px; line-height: 0; overflow: hidden;"><div id="article_in_text_1" class="cns-ads-container" data-ad-seq="1" style="margin: 0px auto; box-sizing: content-box;"></div></div><p data-reactid="256">At one point, Preston Robert Tisch, known to all as Bob, came into the upstairs room at “21.” Bob Tisch and his brother, Laurence, now the head of CBS, had made their fortune in New York and Florida real estate and hotels. Bob Tisch, like his brother, was a city booster, a man of goodwill and manners, a benefactor of hospitals and universities.</p><p data-reactid="257">“I beat Bob Tisch on the convention-center site,” Donald said loudly when Tisch stopped by our table. “But we’re friends now, good friends, isn’t that right, Bob? Isn’t that right?”</p><p data-reactid="258">Bob Tisch’s smile remained on his face, but there was a sudden strain in his tone, as if a child had misbehaved. “Oh yes, Donald,” he said, “good friends. Very good friends.”</p></section><section class="content-section" data-reactid="259"><p data-reactid="260">Late on summer Friday afternoons, the city of noise takes on an eerie quiet. In June I was with one of Donald Trump’s more combative lawyers. “We certainly won’t win in the popular press,” he told me, “but we will win. You’ll see.” I thought of Trump a few blocks away, isolated in Trump Tower, fighting for his financial life.</p><p data-reactid="261">The phone rang several times. “Yeah, yeah? Is that so?” the lawyer said, and then laughed at the sheer—as he phrased it—“brass balls” of his client, standing up to the numbers guys who were representing Chase Manhattan and Bankers Trust, whom he was into for hundreds of millions of dollars. “Donald’s very up. This is the kind of challenge Donald likes,” the lawyer told me. “It’s weird. You would never know anything is wrong.” “Don’t believe anything you read in the papers,” Trump had told his publisher Joni Evans. “When they hear the good news about me, what are they going to do?” Random House was rushing to publish his new book, <em>Trump: Surviving at the Top</em>, with a first printing of 500,000.</p><p data-reactid="262">In the Trump Tower conference room that week, one lawyer had reportedly told Trump the obvious: the Plaza hotel might never bring the $400 million he had paid for it. Trump stayed cool. “Get me the Sultan of Brunei on the telephone,” he said. “I have a personal guarantee that the Sultan of Brunei will take me out of the Plaza at an immense profit.”</p><p data-reactid="263">The bankers and lawyers in the conference room looked at Trump with a combination of awe and disbelief. Whatever their cynical instincts, Trump, the Music Man of real estate, could set off in them the power of imagination, for his real skill has always been his ability to convince others of his possibilities. The line between a con man and an entrepreneur is often fuzzy. “They say the Plaza is worth $400 million? Trump says it’s worth $800 million. Who the hell knows what it is worth? I can tell you one thing: it is worth a lot more than I paid for it,” Trump told me. “When <em>Forbes</em> puts low values on all my properties, they say I am only worth $500 million! Well, that’s $500 million more than I started with.”</p></section><section class="content-section" data-reactid="264"><p data-reactid="265">“Do people really think I am in trouble?” Trump asked me recently.</p><p data-reactid="266">“Yes,” I said, “they think you’re finished.”</p><p data-reactid="267">It was an afternoon in July, when the dust seemed to be settling, and we were in the middle of a two-hour phone conversation. The conversation itself was a negotiation. Trump attempted to put me on the defensive. I had written about him ten years before. Trump had talked about a close friend of his who was the son of a famous New York real-estate developer. “I told him to get out from under his father’s thumb,” Trump told me then. “That was off the record,” Trump told me now. I looked up my old notes. “Wrong, Donald,” I said. “What was off the record was when you attacked your other friend and said he was an alcoholic.” Without missing a beat, Trump said, “I believe you.” Then Trump laughed. “Some things never change.”</p><p data-reactid="268">“Just wait five years,” Trump told me. “This is really a no-brainer. Just like the Merv Griffin deal. When I took him to the cleaners, the press wanted me to lose. They said, ‘Holy shit! Trump got taken!’ Let me tell you something. It’s good for me to be thought of as poor right now. You wouldn’t believe some of the deals I am making! I guess I have a perverse personality. . . . I’ve really enjoyed the last few weeks,” he said, as if he had been rejuvenated at a spa.</p><p data-reactid="269">Deals had always been his only art. He was reportedly getting unbelievable deals now from the contractors he had hired to build his casinos and the fiberglass elephants that decorate the Boardwalk in front of the Taj Mahal, for they were desperate, unsure that they would ever get paid for months of work. Trump was famous for his skill at squeezing every last bit out of his transactions. He was known to be making shocking deals now that he never could have made two months before. “Trump won’t do a deal unless there’s something extra—a kind of moral larceny—in it,” one of his rivals once said of him. “Things had gotten too easy for me,” Trump told me. “I made a lot of money and I made it too easily, to the point of boredom. Anything I did worked! I took on Bally, I made $32 million. After a while it was too easy.”</p><p data-reactid="270">The fear of boredom has always loomed large in Trump’s life. He has a short attention span. He even gave the appearance of having grown bored with his wife. He told me he had grown weary of his deals, his companies, “New York phonies,” “Palm Beach phonies,” most social people, “negative” writers, and “negatives” in general. “You keep hitting and hitting and hitting, and after a while it doesn’t mean as much to you,” Trump told me. “Hey, when you first knew me, I basically had done nothing! So I had built a building or two, big deal.”</p><p data-reactid="271">That morning, Trump had been yet again on the front page of the New York <em>Daily News</em>, because <em>Forbes</em> had dropped him off the list of the world’s richest men, placing his net worth at $500 million, down from $1.7 billion in 1989. “They put me on the front page for this bullshit reason!” Trump said. “If they put me on the cover of the <em>Daily News</em>, they sell more papers! They put me on the cover of the <em>Daily News</em> today with wars breaking out! You know why? Malcolm Forbes got thrown out of the Plaza by me! You know the story about me and Malcolm Forbes, when I kicked him out of the Plaza hotel? No? Well, I did. You’ll read all about it in my new book. And I didn’t throw him out because he didn’t pay his bill. So I’ve been expecting this attack from <em>Forbes.</em> The same writer who wrote about this also wrote that Merv kicked my ass! The same writer is under investigation. You heard about that, didn’t you?” (A <em>Forbes</em> writer is under investigation—for alleged use of outdated police credentials. He did not write that Trump was taken by Merv Griffin.) “What happened to me is what is happening in every company in America right now. There is not a company in America that isn’t restructuring! Didn’t you see <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> this morning about Revlon? What is going on at Revlon is what has happened to Donald Trump. But no one makes Revlon a front-page story. My problems didn’t even merit a <em>column</em> in <em>The Wall Street Journal.</em>” (Revlon was selling $182 million worth of stock to raise cash, but that was hardly the same as Trump’s crisis.)</p><p data-reactid="272">Trump spoke in a hypnotic, unending torrent of words. Often he appeared to free-associate. He referred to himself in the third person: “Trump says. . . Trump believes.” His phrases skibbled around and doubled back on themselves like fireworks in a summer sky. He reminded me of a carnival barker trying to fill his tent. “I’m more popular now than I was two months ago. There are two publics as far as I’m concerned. The real public and then there’s the New York society horseshit. The real public has always liked Donald Trump. The real public feels that Donald Trump is going through Trump-bashing. When I go out now, forget about it. I’m mobbed. It’s bedlam,” Trump told me.</p><p data-reactid="273">Trump is often belligerent, as if to pep things up. On the telephone with me, he attacked a local writer as “a disgrace” and savaged a financier’s wife I knew as “a giant, a three in the looks department.” After the Resorts International deal, at a New Year’s Eve party at the Aspen home of Barbara Walters and Merv Adelson, Trump was asked to make a wish for the coming year. “I wish I had another Merv Griffin to bat around,” he said.</p><p data-reactid="274">Before the opening of the Taj Mahal, Marvin Roffman, a financial analyst from Philadelphia, correctly stated that the Taj was in for a rough ride. For that, Roffman believes, Trump had him fired. “Is that why you attacked him?” I asked Trump. “I’d do it again. Here’s a guy that used to call me, begging me to buy stock through him, with the implication that if I’d buy stock he’d give me positive comments.” “Are you accusing him of fraud?” I asked. “I’m accusing him of being not very good at what he does.” Congressman John Dingell of Michigan asked the S.E.C. to investigate the circumstances of Roffman’s firing. When I asked Roffman about Trump’s charges he said, “That’s the most unbelievable garbage I’ve ever heard in my entire life.” Roffman’s attorney James Schwartzman called Trump’s allegations “the desperate act of a desperate man.” Roffman is now suing Trump for defamation of character.</p></section><section class="content-section" data-reactid="275"><p data-reactid="276">“Donald is a believer in the big-lie theory,” his lawyer had told me. “If you say something again and again, people will believe you.”</p><div id="cns-ads-slot-type-article-in-text-2" class="cns-ads-stage cns-ads-slot-type-article-in-text cns-ads-slot-type-article-in-text-2" data-name="article_in_text_2" data-slot-type="article_in_text" style="font-size: 0px; line-height: 0; overflow: hidden;"><div id="article_in_text_2" class="cns-ads-container" data-ad-seq="2" style="margin: 0px auto; box-sizing: content-box;"></div></div><p data-reactid="277">“One of my lawyers said that?” Trump said when I asked him about it. “I think if one of my lawyers said that, I’d like to know who it is, because I’d fire his ass. I’d like to find out who the scumbag is!”</p><p data-reactid="278">One of Trump’s first major deals in New York was to acquire a large tract of land on West Thirty-fourth Street being offered by the bankrupt Penn Central railroad. Trump submitted a plan for a convention center to city officials. “He told us he’d forgo his $4.4 million fee if we would name the new convention center after his father,” former deputy mayor Peter Solomon said. “Someone finally read the contract. He wasn’t entitled to anywhere near the money he was claiming. It was unbelievable. He almost got us to name the convention center after his father in return for something he never really had to give away.”</p><p data-reactid="279">Trump’s first major real-estate coup in New York was the acquisition of the Commodore Hotel, which would become the Grand Hyatt. This deal, secured with a controversial tax abatement from the city, made Trump’s reputation. His partner at the time was the well-respected Pritzker family of Chicago, who owned the Hyatt chain. Their contract was specific: Trump and Jay Pritzker agreed that if there were any sticking points they would have a ten-day period to arbitrate their differences. At one point, they had a minor disagreement. “Jay Pritzker was leaving for a trip to Nepal, where he was to be incommunicado,” a lawyer for the Pritzker family told me. “Donald waited until Jay was in the airplane before he called him. Naturally, Jay couldn’t call him back. He was on a mountain in Nepal. Later, Donald kept saying, ‘I tried to call you. I gave you the ten days. But you were in Nepal.’ It was outrageous. Pritzker was his partner, not his enemy! This is how he acted on his first important deal.” Trump later even reported the incident in his book.</p><p data-reactid="280">“Give them the old Trump bullshit,” he told the architect Der Scutt before a presentation of the Trump Tower design at a press conference in 1980. “Tell them it is going to be a million square feet, sixty-eight stories.” “I don’t lie, Donald,” the architect replied.</p><p data-reactid="281">Eventually Trump bought out the Equitable Life Assurance company’s share of the commercial space in Trump Tower. “He paid Equitable $60 million after an arm’s-length negotiation,” a top real-estate developer told me. “The equity for the entire commercial space was $120 million. Suddenly, Donald was saying that it was worth $500 million!”</p><p data-reactid="282">When <em>The Art of the Deal</em> was published, he told <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> that the first printing would be 200,000. It was 50,000 fewer than that.</p><p data-reactid="283">When Charles Feldman of CNN questioned Trump in March about the collapse of his business empire, Trump stormed off the set. Later, he told Feldman’s boss, Ted Turner, “Your reporter threatened my secretary and made her cry.”</p><p data-reactid="284">When the stock market collapsed, he announced that he had gotten out in time and had lost nothing. In fact, he had taken a beating on his Alexander’s and American Airlines stock. “What I said was, <em>other than</em> my Alexander’s and American Airlines stock, I was out of the market,” Trump told me swiftly.</p></section><section class="content-section" data-reactid="285"><p data-reactid="286">What forces in Donald Trump’s background could have set off in him such a need for self-promotion?</p><p data-reactid="287">Ten years ago, I went to visit Trump’s father in his offices on Avenue Z on the border of Coney Island in Brooklyn. Fred Trump’s own real-estate fortune had been made with the help of the Brooklyn political machine and especially Abe Beame. In the 1940s, Trump and Beame shared a close friend and lawyer, a captain in a Brooklyn political club named Bunny Lindenbaum. At that time, Beame worked in the city budget office; thirty years later he would become mayor of the city. Trump, Lindenbaum, and Beame often saw one another at dinner dances and fund-raisers of the Brooklyn political clubs. It is impossible to overestimate the power of these clubs in the New York of the 1950s; they created Fred Trump and gave him access to his largest acquisition, the seventy-five-acre parcel of city land that would become the 3,800-unit Trump Village.</p><p data-reactid="288">In 1960, an immense tract of land off Ocean Parkway in Brooklyn became available for development. The City Planning Commission had approved a generous tax abatement for a nonprofit foundation to build a housing cooperative. Fred Trump attacked this abatement as “a giveaway.” Soon after, Trump himself decided to go after the tax abatement. Although the City Planning Commission had already approved the nonprofit plan, Lindenbaum went to see Mayor Robert Wagner, and Beame, who was in Wagner’s camp, supported Trump.</p><p data-reactid="289">Fred Trump wound up with two-thirds of the property, and within a year he had broken ground on Trump Village. Lindenbaum was given the City Planning Commission seat formerly held by Robert Moses, the power broker who built many of New York’s highways, airports, and parks. The following year, Lindenbaum organized a fund-raising lunch for Wagner, who was running for re-election. Forty-three builders and landlords pledged thousands of dollars; Trump, according to reporter Wayne Barrett, pledged $2,500, one of the largest contributions. The lunch party made the front page of the newspapers, and Lindenbaum, disgraced, was forced off the commission. But Robert Wagner won the election, and Beame became his comptroller.</p><p data-reactid="290">In 1966, as Donald was entering his junior year at the Wharton business school, Fred Trump and Lindenbaum were investigated for their role in a $60 million Mitchell-Lama mortgage. “Is there any way of preventing a man who does business in that way from getting another contract with the state?” the investigations-commission chairman asked about Trump and Lindenbaum. Ultimately, Trump was forced to return $1.2 million that he had overestimated on the land—part of which money he had used to buy a site nearby on which to build a shopping center.</p><p data-reactid="291">Fred Trump’s office was pleasantly modest; the rooms were divided by glass partitions. The Trump Organization, as Donald had already grandly taken to calling his father’s company, was a small cottage on the grounds of Trump Village. At the time, Donald told reporters that “the Trump Organization” had 22,000 units, although it had about half that number. Fred Trump was seventy-five then, polite, but nobody’s fool. He criticized many of his son’s early deals, warning him at one point that expanding into Manhattan was “a ticket on the <em>Titanic</em>.” Donald ignored him. “A peacock today, a feather duster tomorrow,” the developer Sam Lefrak is said to have remarked of Donald Trump. But ten years ago it was clear that Donald was the embodiment of his father’s dreams. “I always tell Donald, ‘The elevator to success is out of order. Go one step at a time,’ ” Fred Trump told me. “But what do you think of what my Donald has put together? It boggles the mind!”</p><p data-reactid="292">Donald Trump has always viewed his father as a role model. In <em>The Art of the Deal</em>, he wrote, “Fred Trump was born in New Jersey in 1905. His father, who came here from Sweden . . . owned a moderately successful restaurant.” In fact, the Trump family was German and desperately poor. “At one point my mother took in stitching to keep us going,” Trump’s father told me. “For a time, my father owned a restaurant in the Klondike, but he died when I was young.” Donald’s cousin John Walter once wrote out an elaborate family tree. “We shared the same grandfather,” Walter told me, “and he was German. So what?”</p><p data-reactid="293">Although Fred Trump was born in New Jersey, family members say he felt compelled to hide his German background because most of his tenants were Jewish. “After the war, he thought that Jews would never rent from him if they knew his lineage,” Ivana reportedly said. Certainly, Fred Trump’s camouflage could easily convey to a child the impression that in business anything goes. When I asked Donald Trump about this, he was evasive: “Actually, it was very difficult. My father was not German; my father’s <em>parents</em> were German . . . Swedish, and really sort of all over Europe . . . and I was even thinking in the second edition of putting more emphasis on other places because I was getting so many letters from Sweden: Would I come over and speak to Parliament? Would I come meet with the president?”</p><div id="cns-ads-slot-type-article-in-text-3" class="cns-ads-stage cns-ads-slot-type-article-in-text cns-ads-slot-type-article-in-text-3" data-name="article_in_text_3" data-slot-type="article_in_text" style="font-size: 0px; line-height: 0; overflow: hidden;"><div id="article_in_text_3" class="cns-ads-container" data-ad-seq="3" style="margin: 0px auto; box-sizing: content-box;"></div></div><p data-reactid="294">Donald Trump appears to take aspects of his German background seriously. John Walter works for the Trump Organization, and when he visits Donald in his office, Ivana told a friend, he clicks his heels and says, “<em>Heil</em> Hitler,” possibly as a family joke.</p><p data-reactid="295">Last April, perhaps in a surge of Czech nationalism, Ivana Trump told her lawyer Michael Kennedy that from time to time her husband reads a book of Hitler’s collected speeches, <em>My New Order</em>, which he keeps in a cabinet by his bed. Kennedy now guards a copy of <em>My New Order</em> in a closet at his office, as if it were a grenade. Hitler’s speeches, from his earliest days up through the Phony War of 1939, reveal his extraordinary ability as a master propagandist.</p><p data-reactid="296">“Did your cousin John give you the Hitler speeches?” I asked Trump.</p><p data-reactid="297">Trump hesitated. “Who told you that?”</p><p data-reactid="298">“I don’t remember,” I said.</p><p data-reactid="299">“Actually, it was my friend Marty Davis from Paramount who gave me a copy of <em>Mein Kampf</em>, and he’s a Jew.” (“I did give him a book about Hitler,” Marty Davis said. “But it was <em>My New Order</em>, Hitler’s speeches, not <em>Mein Kampf.</em> I thought he would find it interesting. I am his friend, but I’m not Jewish.”)</p><p data-reactid="300">Later, Trump returned to this subject. “<em>If</em> I had these speeches, and I am not saying that I do, I would never read them.”</p><p data-reactid="301">Is Ivana trying to convince her friends and lawyer that Trump is a crypto-Nazi? Trump is no reader or history buff. Perhaps his possession of Hitler’s speeches merely indicates an interest in Hitler’s genius at propaganda. The <em>Führer</em> often described his defeats at Stalingrad and in North Africa as great victories. Trump continues to endow his diminishing world with significance as well. “There’s nobody that has the cash flow that I have,” he told <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> long after he knew better. “I want to be king of cash.”</p><p data-reactid="302">Fred Trump, like his son, has never resisted exaggeration. When Donald was a child, his father bought a house that “had nine bathrooms and columns like Tara,” Fred Trump said. The house, however, was in Queens. Donald would someday envision a larger world. It was Donald’s mother, Mary, who revered luxury. “My mother had a sense of the grand,” Trump told me. “I can remember her watching the coronation of Queen Elizabeth and being so fascinated by it. My father had no interest in that kind of thing at all.”</p><p data-reactid="303">Donald Trump often went with his father to construction sites, for they were extraordinarily close, almost kindred spirits. In family photographs, Fred and Donald stand together, often arm in arm, while Donald’s sisters and younger brother, Robert, seem off in the ether. Ivana has told friends that Donald even persuaded his father to put him in charge of his three siblings’ trust funds.</p><p data-reactid="304">Donald was one of five children, the second son. As a child, he was so boisterous that his parents sent him away to military school. “That was the way it worked in the Trump family,” a longtime friend told me. “It was not a loving atmosphere.” Donald was chubby then, but military school slimmed him down. He became forceful, and grew even closer to his father. “I had to fight back all the time,” Trump once told me. “These guys like my father are tough. You have to be hitting back! Otherwise they don’t respect you!”</p><p data-reactid="305">Family members say that the firstborn son, Fred junior, often felt shut out by the relationship between Donald and his father. As a young man, he announced his intention to be an airplane pilot. Later, according to a friend of Ivana’s, Donald and his father often belittled Fred junior for this career choice. “Donald would say, ‘What is the difference between what you do and driving a bus? Why aren’t you in the family real-estate business?’ ” Fred junior became an alcoholic and died at age forty-three. Ivana has always told her close friends that she believed the pressure put on him by his father and his brother hastened his early death. “Perhaps unknowingly [we did put pressure on him],” Trump told me. “We assumed that [real estate] came rather easy to us and it should have come easily to him. I had success, and that put pressure on Fred too. What is this, a psychoanalysis of Donald?”</p><p data-reactid="306">Donald’s relationship with Robert has also had troubled moments. Robert, who did go into the family business, has always been “the nice guy,” in his brother’s shadow. There has been additional friction between Robert’s wife, Blaine, and Ivana. Blaine is considered a workhorse for New York charities, and Robert and Blaine are extremely popular—“the good Trumps,” they are called. “Robert and I feel that if we say anything about the family, then we become public people,” Blaine told me. The brothers’ suppressed hostility erupted after the opening of the Taj Mahal. “Robert told Donald that if he didn’t give him autonomy he would leave,” Ivana told a friend. “So Donald did leave him alone, and there was a mess with the slot machines which cost Donald $3 million to $10 million in the first three days. When Donald exploded, Robert packed his boxes and left. He and Blaine went to her family for Easter.”</p><div data-reactid="307"><div class="embed cneembed"><div style="box-sizing:content-box;display:inline-block;height:0px;padding-top:56.25%;position:relative;transition:height 300ms ease-in-out;vertical-align:top;width:100%;" class="cne-player-container" id="c5687200-d8f9-bb29-5dc9-ea3e2216fd7b"><iframe style="height:1px !important;left:0px;min-height:100%;min-width:100%;position:absolute;top:0px;width:1px !important;" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="true" msallowfullscreen="true" allowtransparency="true" title="Video Player"></iframe></div><script type="text/javascript" async="" src="//player.cnevids.com/script/video/56a92c1494c05f1e3800002a.js?autoplay=1&amp;muted=1" class="processed"></script><div class="embed block cneembed" data-url="//player.cnevids.com/script/video/56a92c1494c05f1e3800002a.js?autoplay=1&amp;muted=1"></div></div></div></section><section class="content-section" data-reactid="308"><p data-reactid="309">As his father had had Bunny Lindenbaum for his fixer, Donald Trump had Roy Cohn, the Picasso of the inside fix. “Cohn taught Donald which fork to use,” a friend told me. “I’ll bring my lawyer Roy Cohn with me,” Trump often told city officials a decade ago, before he learned better. “Donald calls me fifteen to twenty times a day,” Cohn once told me. “He has a maddening attention to detail. He is always asking, ‘What is the status of this? What is the status of that?’ ”</p><p data-reactid="310">In a Trump tax-abatement case, according to Cohn’s biographer Nicholas von Hoffman, the judge was handed a piece of paper that looked like an affidavit. It had just one sentence on it: “No further delays or adjournments. Stanley M. Friedman.” By then Friedman had become the county leader of the Bronx. It wasn’t necessary to exchange money for such favors. This was a classic “marker”; the power of suggestion of future favors was enough.</p><p data-reactid="311">Friedman had also been crucial to Trump’s plans for the Commodore Hotel. “In the final days of the Beame administration,” according to Wayne Barrett, “Friedman rushed a $160 million, forty-year tax abatement . . . and actually executed the documents for the lame duck Beame.” Friedman had already agreed to join Cohn’s law firm, which was representing Trump. “Trump lost his moral compass when he made an alliance with Roy Cohn,” Liz Smith once remarked.</p><div id="cns-ads-slot-type-article-in-text-4" class="cns-ads-stage cns-ads-slot-type-article-in-text cns-ads-slot-type-article-in-text-4" data-name="article_in_text_4" data-slot-type="article_in_text" style="font-size: 0px; line-height: 0; overflow: hidden;"><div id="article_in_text_4" class="cns-ads-container" data-ad-seq="4" style="margin: 0px auto; box-sizing: content-box;"></div></div><p data-reactid="312">In New York, Trump soon became known for his confrontational style. He also became the largest contributor to Governor Hugh Carey of New York, except for Carey’s brother. Trump and his father gave $135,000. He was moving quickly now; he had set himself up in a Fifth Avenue office and a Fifth Avenue apartment and had hired Louise Sunshine, Carey’s chief of fund-raising, as his “director of special projects.” “I knew Donald better than anyone,” she told me. “We’re a team, Sunshine and Trump, and when people shove us, we shove harder.” Sunshine had raised millions of dollars for Carey, and she had one of the greatest address books in the city. She took Donald to meet every city and state power broker and worked on the sale of the Trump Tower apartments.</p><p data-reactid="313">Real-estate tax is immensely complicated. Often profit-and-loss accounting does not run parallel with cash flow. Sometimes a developer can have tremendous cash flow and yet not report taxable earnings; tax laws also permit developers to have less cash flow and greater taxable earnings. It is up to the developer. When Donald Trump broke ground on a new apartment building at Sixty-first Street and Third Avenue, Louise Sunshine was given a 5 percent share of the new Trump Plaza, as it was called.</p><p data-reactid="314">There was some friction in Sunshine’s relationship with her boss. As a result of Trump’s accounting on Trump Plaza, Louise Sunshine, according to a close friend, would have had to pay taxes of $1 million. “Why are you structuring Trump Plaza this way?” she reportedly asked Donald. “Where am I going to get $1 million?” “Sell me back your 5 percent share of Trump Plaza and you can have it,” Trump said.</p><p data-reactid="315">Sunshine was so stunned by this that she went to her friend billionaire Leonard Stern for help. “I wrote out a check for $1 million on the spot so that my close friend would not find herself squeezed out by Donald,” Stern told me. “I said to Louise, ‘You tell Trump that unless he treats you fairly you will litigate! And as a result, the details of his duplicitous treatment would not only come to the attention of the public but also to the Casino Control Commission.’ ” Louise Sunshine hired Arthur Liman, who would later represent the financier Michael Milken, to handle her case. Liman worked out a settlement: Trump paid Louise Sunshine $2.7 million for her share of Trump Plaza. Sunshine repaid Leonard Stern. For several years, Trump and Sunshine had a cool relationship. But in fine New York style, they are now friends again. “Donald never should have used his money as a power tool over me,” Sunshine told me, adding, “I have absolved him.”</p><p data-reactid="316">Like Michael Milken, Trump began to believe that his inordinate skills could be translated into any business. He started to expand out of the familiar world of real estate into casinos, airlines, and hotels. With Citicorp as his enabler, he bought the Plaza and the Eastern shuttle. He managed them both surprisingly well, but he had paid too much for them. He always had the ready cooperation of the starstruck banks, which would later panic. A member of the board of the Chase Manhattan Bank recently demanded at a meeting, “What in God’s name were you thinking of to make these loans?” No satisfactory answer was forthcoming; the Rockefeller bank had once kept Brazil afloat, too. The bankers, like the Brooklyn-machine hacks from Trump’s childhood, were blame shufflers, frantic to keep the game going.</p><p data-reactid="317">“You cannot believe the money the banks were throwing at us,” a former top legal associate of Trump’s told me. “For every deal we did, we would have six or eight banks who were willing to give us hundreds of millions of dollars. We used to have to pick through the financings; the banks could not sign on fast enough to anything Donald conceived.”</p><p data-reactid="318">“He bought more and more properties and expanded so much that he guaranteed his own self-destruction. His fix was spending money. Well, his quick fix became his Achilles’ heel,” a prominent developer told me.</p><p data-reactid="319">Trump’s negotiations, according to one lawyer who worked on the acquisition of the Atlantic City casino of Resorts International, were always unusually unpleasant. After the success of <em>The Art of the Deal</em>, Trump’s lawyers began to talk about “Donald’s ego” as if it were a separate entity. “Donald’s ego will never permit us to accept that point,” one lawyer said over and over again during the negotiations. “The key to Donald, like with any bully, is to tell him to go fuck himself,” the lawyer told me. When Mortimer Zuckerman, the chairman and C.E.O. of Boston Properties, submitted a design that was chosen for the site of the Fifty-ninth Street coliseum, Trump became apoplectic. “He called everyone, trying to get his deal killed. Of course, Mort’s partner was Salomon Brothers, so Trump got nowhere,” a person close to Zuckerman remembered.</p></section><section class="content-section" data-reactid="320"><p data-reactid="321">One image of Ivana and Donald Trump sticks in my memory. Wintertime, three years ago. They were at the Wollman Rink. Donald had just fixed it up for the city. He had been crowing in the newspapers about what dummies Mayor Koch and the city had been, wasting years and money and coming up with nothing on the skating rink. Trump had taken over the job and done it well. If he grabbed more of the credit than he deserved, no one really held it against him; the rink was open at last and filled with happy skaters.</p><p data-reactid="322">Ivana was wearing a striking lynx coat which showed her blond hair to advantage. Their arms were around each other. They looked so very young and rich, living in the moment of their success. A polite crowd had gathered to congratulate them on the triumph of the rink. The people near Donald appeared to feel enlivened by his presence, as if he were a hero. His happiness seemed a reflection of the crowd’s adulation.</p><p data-reactid="323">Next to me a man called out, “Why don’t you negotiate the SALT talks for Reagan, Donald?” Ivana beamed. The snow began falling very lightly; from the rink below you could hear “The Skaters’ Waltz.”</p></section><section class="content-section" data-reactid="324"><p data-reactid="325">Some months before the Trumps’ separation, Donald and Ivana were due at a dinner party being given in their honor. The Trumps were late, and this was not a dinner to be taken lightly. The hosts had a family name that evoked the very history of New York, yet as if they had recognized another force coming up in the city, they were honoring Donald and Ivana Trump.</p><p data-reactid="326">Trump entered the room first. “I had to tape the Larry King show,” he said. “I’m on Larry King tonight.” He seemed very restless. Trump paid little attention to his blonde companion, and no one in the room recognized Ivana until she began to speak. “My God! What has she done to herself?” one guest asked. Ivana’s Slavic cheeks were gone; her lips had been fluffed up into a pout. Her limbs had been resculpted, and her cleavage astonishingly enhanced. The guests were so confused by her looks that her presence created an odd mood.</p><p data-reactid="327">All through dinner Donald fidgeted. He looked at his watch. He mentioned repeatedly that he was at that moment on the Larry King show, as if he expected the guests to get up from their places. He had been belligerent to King that night, and he wanted the guests to see him, perhaps to confirm his powers. “Do you mind if I sit back a little? Because your breath is very bad—it really is,” he had told Larry King on national TV.</p></section><section class="content-section" data-reactid="328"><p data-reactid="329">“Come on, Arnold! Pose with me! Come on!” Ivana Trump called out to the designer Arnold Scaasi on a warm night this past June. They were at the Waldorf-Astoria, at an awards ceremony sponsored by the Fragrance Foundation, and Ivana was a presenter. The carpet was shabby in the Jade Room; the paparazzi were waiting to pounce. P.R. materials covered the tables of this “must do” event, of the kind that often passes for New York social life. The most expensive couture dress looked, under the blue-green tint of the lights, cheap.</p><p data-reactid="330">I was surprised that she appeared. The day before, her husband’s crisis with the banks had provided the headlines on all three of the local tabloids. TRUMP IN A SLUMP! cried the <em>Daily News.</em> One columnist even said Trump’s problems were the occasion for city joy, and proposed a unity day. “Ivana! Ivana! Ivana!” the photographers called out to her. Ivana smiled, as if she were a presidential candidate. She wore a full-skirted mint-green satin beaded gown; her hair was swept off her face in a chignon. However humiliated for her children’s sake she may have felt by the bad publicity, she had elected to leave them at home that night. Ivana was at the Waldorf by 6:15 P.M., greeting reporters and paparazzi by name. She could not afford now to alienate the perfume establishment by canceling, for soon she would be merchandising a fragrance, and she would need their goodwill.</p><p data-reactid="331">Ivana seemed determined to keep her new stature in the city of alliances, for her financial future depended on her being able to salvage the brand name. As a woman alone, with a reduced fortune, Ivana was entering a tough world. She had no Rothkos to hock and no important jewels. But she did have the name Ivana, and she was making plans to market scarves, perfumes, handbags, and shoes, as once her husband had been able to market the name Trump.</p><p data-reactid="332">Several feet away from us, the local CBS reporter was doing a stand-up for the evening news. The reporter was commenting on the unraveling of the Trump empire while Ivana was chatting with Scaasi and Estée Lauder. Lauder, a tough businesswoman herself, had reportedly told Ivana several months earlier, “Go back with Donald. It is a cold world out here.” I was reminded of a crowd scene in Nathanael West’s <em>Day of the Locust.</em> Ivana even allowed the CBS reporter to shove a microphone into her face. “Donald and I are partners in marriage and in business. I will stand beside him through thick or thin, for better or worse,” she told the reporters with bizarre aplomb. Ivana had become, like Donald, a double agent, able to project innocence and utter confidence. She had, in fact, almost turned into Donald Trump.</p><div id="cns-ads-slot-type-article-in-text-5" class="cns-ads-stage cns-ads-slot-type-article-in-text cns-ads-slot-type-article-in-text-5" data-name="article_in_text_5" data-slot-type="article_in_text" style="font-size: 0px; line-height: 0; overflow: hidden;"><div id="article_in_text_5" class="cns-ads-container" data-ad-seq="5" style="margin: 0px auto; box-sizing: content-box;"></div></div><p data-reactid="333">“To tell you the truth, I’ve made Ivana a very popular woman. I’ve made a lot of satellites. Hey, whether it’s Marla or Ivana. Marla can do any movie she wants to now. Ivana can do whatever she wants,” Donald Trump told me on the phone.</p><p data-reactid="334">“New York City is a very tough place,” Ivana Trump told me years ago. “I’m tough, too. When people give me a punch in the nose, I react by getting even tougher.” We were walking through the rubble of the Commodore Hotel, which would soon reopen as the Grand Hyatt. Ivana had been given the responsibility of supervising all the decoration; she was hard at it, despite the fact that she was wearing a white wool Thierry Mugler jumpsuit and pale Dior shoes as she picked her way through the sawdust. “I told you never to leave a broom like this in a room!” she screamed at one worker. Screaming at her employees had become part of her hallmark, perhaps her way of feeling power. Later, in Atlantic City, she would become known for her obsession with cleanliness.</p><p data-reactid="335">The phrase “Stockholm syndrome” is now used by Ivana’s lawyer Michael Kennedy to describe her relationship with Donald. “She had the mentality of a captive,” Kennedy told me. “After a while she couldn’t fight her captor anymore, and she began to identify with him. Ivana is deaf, dumb, and blind when it comes to Donald.” If Donald worked eighteen-hour days, so would Ivana. The Trumps hired two nannies and a bodyguard for their children. She went to work running Trump Castle casino in Atlantic City, often spending two or three days a week there supervising the staff.</p><p data-reactid="336">Determined to bring glamour to Trump Castle, she became famous for her attention to appearances, once moving a pregnant waitress, desperate for big tips, off the casino floor. The woman was placed in a distant lounge and given a clown’s suit to disguise her condition.</p><p data-reactid="337">In New York, Ivana did not resist her husband’s grandiosity. Soon after Trump Tower was completed, the Trumps took possession of their triplex. Ivana’s lawyers often talk about her love of the domestic arts and describe her homemade jams and jellies. Yet the kitchen of her city apartment, which she designed, is tiny, no more than a kitchenette, tiled with gold linoleum. “The children’s wing has a kitchen, and that is where the nanny cooks,” a friend said. The Trump living room has a beige onyx floor with holes carved out to fit the carpets. There is a waterfall cascading down a marble wall, an Italianate fountain, and the famous murals. Their bedroom had a glass wall filled with arrangements of silk flowers. After a time, Ivana tired of the décor. She called in a renowned decorator. “What can I do with this interior?” she reportedly asked him. “Absolutely nothing,” he said.</p></section><section class="content-section" data-reactid="338"><p data-reactid="339">Christmas Eve, three years ago. Ivana had received another stack of legal documents the size of a telephone book. “What is this?” she is said to have asked Donald. “It is our new nuptial agreement. You get $10 million. Sign it!” “But I can’t look at this now, it’s Christmas,” Ivana said. Donald pressed her, according to Kennedy. Trump seemed extraordinarily concerned that she sign the papers, perhaps because an Atlantic City photographer was threatening to blackmail him with photos he had taken of him and Marla Maples. However efficiently Ivana ran Trump Castle, she seemed terrified of her husband. She signed the papers giving her $10 million and the mansion in Greenwich, Connecticut. Later, Trump would tell reporters, “Ivana has $25 million.”</p><p data-reactid="340">The tactics he used in business he now brought home. “Donald began calling Ivana and screaming all the time: ‘You don’t know what you are doing!’ ” one of Ivana’s top assistants told me. “When Ivana would hang up the phone, I would say, ‘How can you put up with this?’ and Ivana would say, ‘Because Donald is right.’ ” He began belittling her: “That dress is terrible.” “You’re showing too much cleavage.” “You never spend enough time with the children.” “Who would touch those plastic breasts?” Ivana told her friends that Donald had stopped sleeping with her. She blamed herself. “I think it was Donald’s master plan to get rid of Ivana in Atlantic City,” one of her assistants told me. “By then, Marla Maples was in a suite at the Trump Regency. Atlantic City was to be their playground.”</p><p data-reactid="341">Ivana had once warned her husband against Atlantic City. “Why expand somewhere where there is no airport?” Trump, however, was determined to invest there, even though Las Vegas associates had told him that Nevada gaming had profit factors that could total $200 million a year. But by now Marla Maples was in Atlantic City, and it was close to New York. Trump had become, according to one friend, “so focused on Marla he wasn’t paying attention to his business.”</p><p data-reactid="342">Though Ivana had established herself in Atlantic City to please Donald, her presence there now, with Marla on the scene, was an inconvenience to him. With the acquisition of the Plaza hotel, he could deliver an ultimatum: “Either you act like my wife and come back to New York and take care of your children or you run the casino in Atlantic City and we get divorced.”</p><p data-reactid="343">“What am I going to do?” she asked one of her assistants. “If I don’t do what he says, I am going to lose him.”</p><p data-reactid="344">Trump even called a press conference to announce Ivana’s new position as the president of the Plaza hotel: “My wife, Ivana, is a brilliant manager. I will pay her one dollar a year and all the dresses she can buy!” Ivana called her friends in tears. “How can Donald humiliate me this way?”</p><div data-reactid="345"><div class="embed cneembed"><div style="box-sizing:content-box;display:inline-block;height:0px;padding-top:56.25%;position:relative;transition:height 300ms ease-in-out;vertical-align:top;width:100%;" class="cne-player-container" id="e3f93876-851-efec-afa0-6037d7a35c8d"><iframe style="height:1px !important;left:0px;min-height:100%;min-width:100%;position:absolute;top:0px;width:1px !important;" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="true" msallowfullscreen="true" allowtransparency="true" title="Video Player"></iframe></div><script type="text/javascript" async="" src="//player.cnevids.com/script/video/55f9946461646d0c1c000001.js?autoplay=1&amp;muted=1" class="processed"></script><div class="embed block cneembed" data-url="//player.cnevids.com/script/video/55f9946461646d0c1c000001.js?autoplay=1&amp;muted=1"></div></div></div></section><section class="content-section" data-reactid="346"><p data-reactid="347">“I think Marla is very different from her image,” Donald Trump told me in July. “Her image is that of a very good-looking buxom blonde.” A Donna Rice? “She’s much different than that. She’s smart, she’s very nice, and not ambitious. She could have made a fortune in the last six months if she had wanted to!”</p><p data-reactid="348">“How could you have allowed Marla to be the No Excuses jeans girl?” I asked Trump. “Because I figured she could make $600,000 for doing one day’s work. For the negative publicity, I thought, that $600,000 she can live on the rest of her life,” Trump told me.</p><p data-reactid="349">This past February, Trump took off for Japan, telling reporters he would be attending the Mike Tyson fight. His real motive was reportedly to meet with bankers to try to sell the Plaza, for Arthur Andersen’s November audit had been dire. As he was flying back, he was radioed on the plane. Liz Smith had broken the story of the Trumps’ separation. The entire sordid history of Marla Maples and Ivana fighting on the Aspen ski slopes was all over the papers. Ivana had done to Donald what years ago he had done to Jay Pritzker in Nepal. From the airplane, Trump called Liz Smith. “Congratulations on your story,” he told her sarcastically. “I have had it with Ivana. She’s gotten to be like Leona Helmsley.” “Shame on you, Donald!” Smith replied. “How dare you say that about the mother of your children?” “Just write that someone from Howard Rubenstein’s office said it,” Trump told Smith, referring to his well-connected press agent. (“I never said that,” Trump told me. “Yes, he did,” said Smith.) The Japanese bankers with whom Trump had negotiated a tentative sale suddenly backed off. “The Japanese despise scandal,” one of their associates told me.</p><p data-reactid="350">Several weeks later, Donald called Ivana. “Why don’t we walk down Fifth Avenue together for the photographers and pretend that this entire scandal has been a publicity stunt? We could say that we wanted to see who would side with you and who would side with me.” As the press became more sympathetic to Ivana, Donald would scream at his lawyers, “This is bullshit!”</p><p data-reactid="351">Ivana began to repair old feuds all over town. “We can be friends now, Leonard, can’t we?” she said at a recent party, according to a friend of Leonard Stern’s. “Your problem was with Donald, never me. I always liked you.”</p><p data-reactid="352">Trump’s lawyers tried mightily to catch up with Ivana. “Donald saw a bill this week that Ivana charged $7,000 worth of Pratesi sheets for their daughter, Ivancka,” one lawyer said. “He called in a rage. ‘Why does a seven-year-old need $7,000 worth of sheets?’ She charged a $350 shirt at Montenapoleone. Who was that for, her new best friend, Jerry Zipkin?” The lawyer described Ivana’s bills from Carolina Herrera: “We will get a bill for $25,000, and Ivana will have photocopied over the invoice, so instead of one dress at $25,000, in her own handwriting she will write, ‘Six items for $25,000.’ ” (A spokesman for Ivana says that this is completely untrue.)</p><div id="cns-ads-slot-type-article-in-text-6" class="cns-ads-stage cns-ads-slot-type-article-in-text cns-ads-slot-type-article-in-text-6" data-name="article_in_text_6" data-slot-type="article_in_text" style="font-size: 0px; line-height: 0; overflow: hidden;"><div id="article_in_text_6" class="cns-ads-container" data-ad-seq="6" style="margin: 0px auto; box-sizing: content-box;"></div></div><p data-reactid="353">The scandal was seriously affecting the Trump children. Donny junior was being ridiculed at the Buckley School. Ivancka had been in tears at Chapin. When Donald and Marla Maples attended the same Elton John concert, Donny junior cried, for his father had told the children he would give Marla Maples up. “The children are all wrecks,” Ivana told Liz Smith. “I don’t know how Donald can say they are great and fine. Ivancka now comes home from school crying, ‘Mommy, does it mean I’m not going to be Ivancka Trump anymore?’ Little Eric asks me, ‘Is it true you are going away and not coming back?’ ” However cavalier Ivana’s public behavior was, in private she often cried. Once her husband’s co-conspirator, she told friends that she now felt she was his victim.</p></section><section class="content-section" data-reactid="354"><p data-reactid="355">On the Saturday of Donald Trump’s forty-fourth-birthday celebration, I tried to take a walk on the West Side yards above Lincoln Center in Manhattan. The railroad tracks were rusty, the land was overgrown. The property stretched on, block after block. It was cool by the Hudson River that morning, with a pleasant breeze whipping over the water. The only sign of Trump was a high storm fence topped with elaborate curls of barbed wire to keep out the homeless people who live nearby. It was on this land, at the height of his megalomania, that Trump said he would erect “the tallest building in the world,” a plan which was successfully thwarted by neighborhood activists who were resistant to having parts of the West Side obscured in shadow. “They have no power,” Trump said at the time, baffled that anyone would resist his grandiose schemes.</p><p data-reactid="356">Ivana had left for London to take part in one more public-relations event promoting the Plaza, only this time her friends the Baron and Baroness Ricky di Portanova were rumored to be paying the bill. Ivana had had her New York media campaign orchestrated by John Scanlon, who had handled public relations for CBS during the Westmoreland libel case. In London, she was cosseted by Eleanor Lambert, the doyenne of fashion publicists. A story went around London that she couldn’t afford her hotel and had moved in with a friend on Eaton Square. She was treading the same ground as Undine Spragg, who so carefully calculated her rise in Edith Wharton’s <em>The Custom of the Country.</em> Sir Humphry Wakefield assembled a list of titled guests for a dinner, but there was friction between him and Ivana. When the guests, including the Duchess of Northumberland, arrived, many of them were displeased that they had been lured to a dinner which, to their surprise, was in honor of Ivana Trump. “Humphry will pay for this,” one guest reportedly said.</p><p data-reactid="357">That Saturday, New York seemed oddly vacant without the Trumps. Donald had left for his birthday party in Atlantic City. Hundreds of casino employees had been told to be on the Boardwalk to greet him, since Manhattan boosters were in short supply. The day before, he had defaulted on $73 million owed to bondholders and bankers. Clowns and jesters borrowed from Trump’s Xanadu attempted to entertain the waiting employees and reporters underneath Trump’s minarets and elephants, which soon might be repossessed.</p><p data-reactid="358">Trump arrived very late, flanked by his bodyguards. His face was hard, his mouth set into a line. With an elaborate flourish, Trump’s executives pulled a curtain to reveal his birthday tribute, a huge portrait of Donald Trump, the same image the Japanese stared at in his Manhattan tower. The size of the portrait was unsettling on the Atlantic City Boardwalk: ten feet of the Donald, leaning forward on his elbow, his face frozen in the familiar defiant smirk.</p><p data-reactid="359">Within days, the bankers agreed to give Trump $65 million to pay his bills. Much of his empire would probably have to be dismantled, but he would retain control. His personal allowance would now be $450,000 a month. “I can live with that,” Trump said. “However absurd this sounds, it was smarter to do it this way than to let a judge preside over a fire sale in a bankruptcy court,” one banker told me. Trump crowed about the bailout. “This is a great victory. It’s a great agreement for everybody,” he said.</p><p data-reactid="360">Not exactly. Trump’s bankers were said to be so upset at Trump’s balance sheet— he was reportedly over half a billion dollars in the hole—that they demanded he sign over his future trust inheritance to secure the new loans. Trump’s father, who had created him by helping him achieve his first deals, now seemed to be rescuing him again. “Total bullshit,” Trump told me. “I have been given five years by the banks. The banks would never have asked me for my future inheritance, and I would never have given it.”</p><p data-reactid="361">Soon after, Trump announced that the French department store Galeries Lafayette would take over the vast space Bonwit Teller had vacated in Trump Tower. “This is in no way a comeback,” Trump told me. “Because I never went anywhere.”</p></section><section class="content-section" data-reactid="362"><p data-reactid="363">I was still searching for Donald Trump. On a rainy Thursday in July, I went down to federal court, where he was set to testify in a civil case in which he was a defendant. Along with his contractor, Trump had been accused of hiring scores of illegal Polish aliens to do the demolition work on the Trump Tower site. “The Polish brigade,” as they came to be called, had been astonishingly exploited on the job, earning four dollars an hour for work that usually paid five times that.</p><p data-reactid="364">The last time I had been in this neighborhood was to hear the verdict in the John Gotti trial. I had come to know the area well. The guard inside greeted me by name. I was often here dipping in and out of the courtrooms to observe the notorious figures of the last decade. I thought of Bess Myerson, Michael Milken, Ivan Boesky, Leona Helmsley, Imelda Marcos, and Adnan Khashoggi, shattered and brought down in the crazy kaleidoscope of the 1980s. Each one had, at one time in his or her life, been thought to be like Donald Trump, a figure of greatness, anointed with special powers. In front of the courthouse, the police barricades were up. So many celebrities passed through these revolving doors that the yellow saw-horses were left routinely on the massive courthouse steps.</p><p data-reactid="365">I thought about the ten years since I had first met Donald Trump. It is fashionable now to say that he was a symbol of the crassness of the 1980s, but Trump became more than a vulgarian. Like Michael Milken, Trump appeared to believe that his money gave him a freedom to set the rules. No one stopped him. His exaggerations and baloney were reported, and people laughed. His bankers showered him with money. City officials almost allowed him to set public policy by erecting his wall of concrete on the Hudson River. New York City, like the bankers from the Chase and Manny Hanny, allowed Trump to exist in a universe where all reality had vanished. “I met with a couple of reporters,” Trump told me on the telephone, “and they totally saw what I was saying. They completely believed me. And then they went out and wrote vicious things about me, as I am sure you will, too.” Long ago, Trump had counted me among his enemies in his world of “positives” and “negatives.” I felt that the next dozen people he spoke to would probably be subjected to a catalogue of my transgressions as imagined by Donald Trump.</p><p data-reactid="366">When I got to the courtroom, Trump had gone. His lawyer, the venerable and well-connected Milton Gould, was smiling broadly, for he appeared to believe that he was wiping the floor with this case. Trump had said that he knew nothing about the demolitions, that his contractor had been “a disaster.” Yet one F.B.I. informant testified that he had warned Trump of the presence of the Polish brigade and had told him that if he didn’t get rid of them his casino license might not be granted.</p><p data-reactid="367">I wandered down to the pressroom on the fifth floor to hear about Trump’s testimony. The reporters sounded weary; they had heard it all before. “Goddamn it,” one shouted at me, “we created him! We bought his bullshit! He was always a phony, and we filled our papers with him!”</p><p data-reactid="368">I thought about the last questions Donald Trump had asked me the day before on the telephone. “How long is your article?” “Long,” I said. Trump seemed pleased. “Is it a cover?” he asked.</p><div class="mvt-variant" style="min-width:1px;min-height:1px;" data-cn-variation="_8550255229" data-cn-test="_8546053398" data-reactid="369"><div

Donald and Ivana Trump were seated at opposite ends of their long Sheraton table in Mrs. Marjorie Merriweather Post&amp;#x2019;s former dining room. They were posed in imperial style, as if they were a king and queen. They were at the height of their ride, and it was plenty glorious. Trump was seen on the news shows offering his services to negotiate with the Russians. There was talk that he might make a run for president. Ivana had had so much publicity that she now offered interviewers a press kit of flattering clips. Anything seemed possible, the Trumps had grown to such stature in the golden city of New York.&lt;/p&gt;","isEmbed":false,"type":"p"},{"content":"&lt;p&gt;It was balmy that night in Palm Beach; Ivana wore a strapless dress. The air was redolent with the fragrance of oleander and bougainvillea, mingled with the slight smell of mildew which clung to the old house. To his credit, Trump had no interest in mastering the Palm Beach style of navy blazers and linen trousers. Often he wore a business suit to his table; his only concession to local custom was to wear a pink tie or pale shoes. To her credit, Ivana still served the dinners her husband preferred, so on that warm night the guests ate beef with potatoes. Mrs. Post&amp;#x2019;s faux-Tiepolo ceiling remained in the dining room, but an immense silver bowl now rested in the center of the table, filled with plastic fruit. As always, it was business with the Trumps, for that was their common purpose, the bond between them. In recent years, they never seemed to touch each other or exchange intimate remarks in public. They had become less like man and wife and more like two ambassadors from different countries, each with a separate agenda.&lt;/p&gt;","isEmbed":false,"type":"p"},{"content":"&lt;p&gt;The Trumps had bought Mar-a-Lago only a few months earlier, but already they had become Palm Beach curiosities. Across the road was the Bath and Tennis Club, &amp;#x201C;the B and T,&amp;#x201D; as the locals called it, and it was said that the Trumps had yet to be invited to join. &amp;#x201C;Utter bullshit! They kiss my ass in Palm Beach,&amp;#x201D; Trump told me recently. &amp;#x201C;Those phonies! That club called me and asked me if they could have my consent to use part of my beach to expand the space for their cabanas! I said, &amp;#x2018;Of course!&amp;#x2019; Do you think if I wanted to be a member they would have turned me down?

And now this! Embarrassing their guests by having them make speeches, as if they were at a sales convention!&lt;/p&gt;","isEmbed":false,"type":"p"},{"content":"&lt;p&gt;When it was Ivana&amp;#x2019;s turn to introduce herself that night, she rose quickly. &amp;#x201C;I am married to the most &lt;em&gt;wonderful&lt;/em&gt; husband. He is so generous and smart. We are so lucky to have this life.&amp;#x201D; She was desperately playing to him, but Donald said nothing in return. He seemed tired of hearing Ivana&amp;#x2019;s endless praise; her subservient quality appeared to be getting to him. Perhaps he was spoiling for something to excite him, like a fight. Maybe all the public posturing was beginning to get boring, too. &amp;#x201C;Well, I&amp;#x2019;m done,&amp;#x201D; he said before dessert, tossing his napkin on the table and vanishing from the room.&lt;/p&gt;","isEmbed":false,"type":"p"},{"content":"&lt;p&gt;Palm Beach had been Ivana Trump&amp;#x2019;s idea. Long ago, Donald had screamed at her, &amp;#x201C;I want nothing social that you aspire to. If that is what makes you happy, get another husband!&amp;#x201D; But she had no intention of doing that, for Ivana, like Donald, was living out a fantasy. She had seen that in the Trump life everything and everybody appeared to come with a price, or a marker for future use. Ivana had learned to look through Donald with glazed eyes when he said to close friends, as he had in the early years of their marriage, &amp;#x201C;I would never buy Ivana any decent jewels or pictures. Why give her negotiable assets?&amp;#x201D; She had gotten out of Eastern Europe by being tough and highly disciplined, and she had compounded her skills through her husband, the master manipulator. She had learned the lingua franca in a world where everyone seemed to be using everyone else in a relentless drive for power. How was she to know that there was another way to live? Besides, she often told her friends, however cruel Donald could be, she was very much in love with him.&lt;/p&gt;","isEmbed":false,"type":"p"},{"content":"&lt;p&gt;This night Ivana had managed to wedge in the publisher of the local social paper, &amp;#x201C;the Shiny Sheet.&amp;#x201D; As usual, Donald&amp;#x2019;s weekend guests were paybacks, for he trusted few people. He had invited one of his construction executives, the mayor of West Palm Beach, and the former governor of New York, Hugh Carey, who in his days running the state as &amp;#x201C;Society Carey,&amp;#x201D; boosted by huge Trump donations, had been crucial to Trump&amp;#x2019;s early success.&lt;/p&gt;","isEmbed":false,"type":"p"},{"content":"&lt;p&gt;For years, Ivana appeared to have studied the public behavior of the royals. Her friends now called this &amp;#x201C;Ivana&amp;#x2019;s imperial-couple syndrome,&amp;#x201D; and they teased her about it, for they knew that Ivana, like Donald, was inventing and reinventing herself all the time. When she had first come to New York, she wore elaborate helmet hairdos and bouffant satin dresses, very Hollywood; her image of rich American women probably came from the movies she had seen as a child. Ivana had now spent years passing through the fine rooms of New York, but she had never seemed to learn the real way of the truly rich, the art of understatement. Instead, she had become regal, filling her houses with the kind of ormolu found in palaces in Eastern Europe. She had taken to waving to friends with tiny hand motions, as if to conserve her energy. At her own charity receptions, she insisted that she and Donald form a receiving line, and she would stand in pinpoint heels, never sinking into the deep grass&amp;#x2014;such was her control.&lt;/p&gt;","isEmbed":false,"type":"p"},{"content":"&lt;p&gt;This spring night, a squad of servants had been outside to greet the guests, as if they had arrived at Cliveden between the wars. Most of the staff, however, were not a permanent part of Mar-a-Lago; they were local caterers and car parks, hired for the evening. In addition to the dining-room ceiling, Ivana had left Mrs. Post&amp;#x2019;s shabby fringed sofas and Moroccan suites totally in place, giving the impression that she was trying on Mrs. Post&amp;#x2019;s persona too. One of the few signs of the new owners&amp;#x2019; taste was the dozens of silver frames on the many end tables. The frames did not contain family pictures, but magazine covers. Each cover featured the face of Donald Trump.&lt;/p&gt;","isEmbed":false,"type":"p"},{"content":"&lt;p&gt;When the Trump plane landed in Palm Beach, two cars were usually waiting, the first a Rolls-Royce for the adults, the second a station wagon for the children, the nannies, and a bodyguard. Occasionally, state troopers were on hand to speed the Trump motorcade along. This took a certain amount of planning and coordination, but the effort was crucial for what Ivana was trying to achieve. &amp;#x201C;In fifty years Donald and I will be considered old money like the Vanderbilts,&amp;#x201D; she once told the writer Dominick Dunne.&lt;/p&gt;","isEmbed":false,"type":"p"}],"isEmbed":false,"type":"section"},{"content":[{"content":"&lt;p&gt;This past April, when his empire was in danger of collapse, Trump isolated himself in a small apartment on a lower floor of Trump Tower. He would lie on his bed, staring at the ceiling, talking into the night on the telephone. The Trumps had separated. Ivana remained upstairs in the family triplex with its beige onyx floors and low-ceilinged living room painted with murals in the style of Michelangelo. The murals had occasioned one of their frequent fights: Ivana wanted cherubs, Donald preferred warriors. The warriors won. &amp;#x201C;If this were on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, it would be very much in place in terms of quality,&amp;#x201D; Trump once said of the work.

You just love your money,&amp;#x201D; twelve-year-old Donald junior told his father, according to friends of Ivana&amp;#x2019;s. &amp;#x201C;What kind of son have I created?&amp;#x201D; Trump&amp;#x2019;s mother, Mary, is said to have asked Ivana.&lt;/p&gt;","isEmbed":false,"type":"p"},{"content":"&lt;p&gt;However unlikely it seemed, Ivana was now considered a tabloid heroine, and her popularity seemed in inverse proportion to the fickle city&amp;#x2019;s new dislike of her husband. &amp;#x201C;Ivana is now a media goddess on par with Princess Di, Madonna, and Elizabeth Taylor,&amp;#x201D; Liz Smith reported. Months earlier, Ivana had undergone cosmetic reconstruction with a California doctor. She emerged unrecognizable to her friends and perhaps her children, as fresh and innocent of face as Heidi of Edelweiss Farms. Although she had negotiated four separate marital-property agreements over the last fourteen years, she was suing her husband for half his assets. Trump was trying to be philosophical. &amp;#x201C;When a man leaves a woman, especially when it was perceived that he has left for a piece of ass&amp;#x2014;a good one!&amp;#x2014;there are 50 percent of the population who will love the woman who was left,&amp;#x201D; he told me.&lt;/p&gt;","isEmbed":false,"type":"p"},{"content":"&lt;p&gt;Ivana had hired a public-relations man to help her in her new role. &amp;#x201C;This is all very calculated,&amp;#x201D; one of her advisers told me. &amp;#x201C;Ivana is very shrewd.

So let’s just zero in on the money.\n&lt;p&gt;“I’m &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; rich,” Trump declared while announcing his candidacy in June 2015. To prove it, he released a “Summary of Net Worth” balance sheet, indicating a net worth of $8,737,540,000. A month later he upwardly revised that figure to “in excess of TEN BILLION DOLLARS.” (The caps are his.)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Since then, a cottage industry of spreadsheet-diving journalists has worked itself into a lather trying to peg his real net worth. But without tax returns to go on, it’s really anybody’s guess. Despite the all-caps figures Trump has dispensed, most estimates from the established financial-media outlets have been lower, FAR LOWER. &lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt; put his net worth at $4.5 billion. &lt;em&gt;Fortune&lt;/em&gt; postulated $3.7 billion, and later upped it to $3.9 billion. Bloomberg guessed it was “closer to $2.9 billion.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In response to these wanton guesstimates, Trump instinctually fired back at the guesstimators. “&lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt; is a bankrupt magazine, doesn’t know what they’re talking about.” “&lt;em&gt;Fortune&lt;/em&gt; has no idea what my assets are” and “has totally lost its way.” But the real sulfuric acid was reserved for the lowballers over at Bloomberg. As usual, Trump made it personal, even suggesting his “friend,” the former New York City mayor, might be jealous. “Maybe Michael told them to do it,” Trump speculated in the &lt;em&gt;Daily Mail,&lt;/em&gt; “because he always wanted to do what I’m doing.” Perhaps wisely, &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8212;even with its legendary phalanx of persnickety fact-checkers&amp;#8212;wouldn’t venture any closer than “just a back-of-the-envelope calculation” of $2.56 billion, “which shouldn’t be taken too seriously.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In November, Trump was elected president of the United States in a shocking turn of events. He lost the popular vote by some two million ballots.&lt;/p&gt;","socialMedia":[],"photos":{"tout":[{"aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":1400,"height":700,"format":"JPEG","url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2016/05/27/5748bf85ee949d2f614302a8_hive-contributor-profile-donald-trump.jpg"}},"revisionCreatedAt":"May 27, 2016 5:43 pm","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","image":true},"revisionAuthor":"Alyssa Karas","filename":"hive-contributor-profile-donald-trump.jpg","_embedded":{"categories-channels":[],"variantXsmall":[],"variantSmall":[],"variantMedium":[],"variantLarge":[],"variantXlarge":[],"_categories":{}},"title":"hive-contributor-profile-donald-trump.jpg","credit":"By John Lamparski/WireImage/Getty Images.","_links":{},"id":"5748bf85b58adb2f614da194","createdAt":"May 27, 2016 5:43 pm","revision":2,"modifiedAt":"May 27, 2016 5:43 pm","description":"Getty not 250: 522842094","contributors":{}}]},"pubDate":"May 25, 2017 11:21 am","url":"/people/donald-trump","mainPhotoContributors":{},"_embedded":{"photosTout":[{"fields":{"aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":1400,"height":700,"format":"JPEG","url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2016/05/27/5748bf85ee949d2f614302a8_hive-contributor-profile-donald-trump.jpg"}},"revisionCreatedAt":"May 27, 2016 5:43 pm","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","image":true},"revisionAuthor":"Alyssa Karas","filename":"hive-contributor-profile-donald-trump.jpg","_embedded":{"categories-channels":[],"variantXsmall":[],"variantSmall":[],"variantMedium":[],"variantLarge":[],"variantXlarge":[],"_categories":{}},"title":"hive-contributor-profile-donald-trump.jpg","credit":"By John Lamparski/WireImage/Getty Images.","_links":{},"id":"5748bf85b58adb2f614da194","createdAt":"May 27, 2016 5:43 pm","revision":2,"modifiedAt":"May 27, 2016 5:43 pm","description":"Getty not 250: 522842094","contributors":{}}}],"contributorsAuthor":[],"contributorsPhotographer":[],"_categories":{},"publishHistory":{"entityId":"5748bf9ab58adb2f614da195","revision":5,"pubDate":"May 25, 2017 11:21 am","revisionAuthor":"Jarondakie Patrick","searchable":true,"expired":false,"createdAt":"August 1, 2017 5:46 pm","uri":"people/donald-trump"},"related":[{}]},"relatedItems":{"items":[{"hed":"Mitch McConnell Blames the Poor for Trump’s Trillion-Dollar Deficit","promoHed":"Mitch McConnell Blames the Poor for Trump’s Trillion-Dollar Deficit","dek":"“It’s disappointing, but it’s not a Republican problem,” says the man who just passed a $1.5 trillion tax cut.","promoDek":"“It’s disappointing, but it’s not a Republican problem,” says the man who just passed a $1.5 trillion tax cut.","body":"&lt;p&gt;In a life filled with uncertainty, there are a few things you can always count on. First, that death comes for everyone. Second, that the current president of the United States will &lt;a href=\"https://www.thecut.com/2018/10/trump-stormy-daniels-horseface-tweet.html\"&gt;call&lt;/a&gt; an adult-film star he paid to keep quiet about an alleged affair “horseface” on social media. And third, that after passing a $1.5 trillion tax cut they insisted would pay for itself &lt;em&gt;and then some,&lt;/em&gt; Republicans would blame social services like Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security for exploding deficits and debt and insist that such “entitlements,” sadly, have got to go.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As a reminder, the Grand Old Party put on a big show of pretending to care about “fiscal responsibility” when &lt;strong&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/strong&gt; was in office and mouth-watering tax cuts weren’t on the line. “Only one thing can save this country, and that’s to get a handle on this deficit-and-debt issue,” Majority Leader &lt;strong&gt;Mitch McConnell&lt;/strong&gt; insisted after the 44th president won his second term. “The federal fiscal burden threatens the security, liberty, and independence of our nation,” the Republican Party platform &lt;a href=\"https://prod-cdn-static.gop.com/media/documents/DRAFT_12_FINAL%5B1%5D-ben_1468872234.pdf\"&gt;warned&lt;/a&gt; in 2016. “You’re bankrupting our grandchildren!” was a common refrain, as were proclamations &lt;a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/video/full-corker-won-t-support-gop-tax-plan-if-it-adds-to-deficit-1059037763567\"&gt;such as&lt;/a&gt;, “I won’t endorse a bill that adds one penny to the deficit!” Then &lt;strong&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/strong&gt; won the election, and all those worries about crippling the next generation and the country going to hell in a handbasket vanished overnight&amp;#8212;almost as though it was feigned in the first place!&amp;#8212;with Republicans not only demanding that Congress pass a deficit-busting piece of legislation so that the president and his children &lt;a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/20/trump-tax-bill-savings-analysis\"&gt;could pay even fewer taxes&lt;/a&gt; than they &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/donald-trump-fred-trump-taxes\"&gt;already&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/13/business/jared-kushner-taxes.html\"&gt;do&lt;/a&gt;, but maintaining&amp;#8212;laws of math, physics, time and space be damned&amp;#8212;that the bill &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/11/trump-tax-plan-name\"&gt;once known as the “Cut Cut Cut Act”&lt;/a&gt; would actually help &lt;a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/16/trumps-tax-cut-didnt-reduce-the-deficit--despite-his-many-promises.html\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;shrink&lt;/em&gt; the deficit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But as the G.O.P. surely knew, that was never going to happen. Instead, as we &lt;a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/15/us-budget-deficit-expands-to-779-billion-in-fiscal-2018-as-spending-surges.html\"&gt;learned&lt;/a&gt; this week, the U.S. budget deficit increased to $779 billion for the fiscal year, a 17 percent increase from the year prior, which is extra bad considering the economy is doing well, a scenario in which &lt;a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2018/10/16/blame-republican-tax-cuts-soaring-federal-deficits-column/1657338002/\"&gt;the federal deficit typically falls&lt;/a&gt;. Luckily, Mitch McConnell knows exactly &lt;a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-16/mcconnell-blames-entitlements-not-gop-for-rising-deficits\"&gt;who and what to blame&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;“It’s disappointing, but it’s not a Republican problem,” McConnell said Tuesday in an interview with Bloomberg News when asked about the rising deficits and debt. “It’s a bipartisan problem: unwillingness to address the real drivers of the debt by doing anything to adjust those programs to the demographics of America in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The “real” drivers of debt, according to McConnell, are “Medicare, Social Security, and Medicaid,” “entitlements” from which the Senate majority leader would cut off the old and poor if only he could get Democrats to sign on. (That’s probably unlikely to happen, given &lt;strong&gt;Nancy Pelosi’s&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/mcconnell-calls-deficit-very-disturbing-blames-federal-spending-dismisses-criticism-of-tax-cut/2018/10/16/a5b93da0-d15c-11e8-8c22-fa2ef74bd6d6_story.html?utm_term=.a01fd08c01cd\"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; today that, “Like clockwork, Republicans in Congress are setting in motion their plan to destroy the Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security that seniors and families rely on, just months after they exploded the deficit by $2 trillion with their tax scam for the rich,” and &lt;strong&gt;Chuck Schumer’s&lt;/strong&gt; that suggesting cuts to “middle-class programs like Medicare, Social Security, and Medicaid as the only fiscally responsible solution to solve the debt problem is nothing short of gaslighting.”)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;McConnell’s take on the situation echoes that of the White House, whose National Economic Council director, &lt;strong&gt;Larry Kudlow,&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/09/gary-cohn-blames-waitresses-in-las-vegas-for-financial-crisis\"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; last month that he doesn’t “buy” the argument that tax cuts increase the deficit, and that the &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; problem is “principally spending too much.” (Kudlow, who has a penchant for &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/03/tv-pundit-who-blew-the-financial-crisis-could-be-trumps-next-gary-cohn\"&gt;never being right about anything&lt;/a&gt;, also &lt;a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/29/larry-kudlow-says-deficit-coming-down-rapidly-against-cbo-evidence.html\"&gt;claimed&lt;/a&gt; in June that the deficit was “coming down rapidly.”) Treasury Secretary &lt;strong&gt;Steven Mnuchin&lt;/strong&gt; was even more blunt while telling his &lt;a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/11/politics/mnuchin-budget-deficit/index.html\"&gt;assessment&lt;/a&gt; to CNN last week, “People are going to want to say the deficit is because of the tax cuts. That’s not the real story.” (The report out of his own department &lt;a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2018/10/16/blame-republican-tax-cuts-soaring-federal-deficits-column/1657338002/\"&gt;suggests otherwise&lt;/a&gt;.) Incidentally, in June, reports &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/07/the-trump-administration-wants-to-give-the-rich-another-giant-tax-cut\"&gt;circulated&lt;/a&gt; that the Trump administration was trying to figure out a workaround to cut another $100 billion from the tax bills of the wealthiest Americans, and in late September, House Republicans &lt;a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/house-republicans-pass-bill-to-extend-individual-tax-cuts/2018/09/28/2497d6bc-c326-11e8-97a5-ab1e46bb3bc7_story.html\"&gt;passed&lt;/a&gt; a piece of legislation that would add more than $600 billion to the debt over the next decade. Neither measure will come to fruition, but on the off-chance that one does, we’re sure McConnell stands ready to blame the poor and elderly freeloaders who clearly hate America.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you would like to receive the Levin Report in your inbox daily, &lt;a href=\"http://tinyletter.com/besslevin\"&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt; to subscribe.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trump: Saudi Arabia being falsely accused of murder just like Brett Kavanaugh was falsely accused of sexual assault&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;“I think we have to find out what happened first,” the president &lt;a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-16/trump-says-saudi-prince-denies-knowledge-of-khashoggi-incident\"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; the Associated Press on Tuesday while commenting on the compelling body of evidence that points to Saudi Arabia’s involvement in the disappearance of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. “Here we go again with, you know, you’re guilty until proven innocent.

And it’s independent, so I don&amp;#39;t speak to him,” Trump said in an interview with Fox Business, referring to Fed Chairman &lt;strong&gt;Jerome Powell.&lt;/strong&gt; “But I’m not happy with what he’s doing because it’s going too fast. Because&amp;#8212;you look at the last inflation numbers, they’re very low.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Trump has been attacking Powell for several months now over the central banker’s decision to raise rates, which President Buy and Sell blamed last week for the two-day market decline. “The problem [causing the market drop] in my opinion is Treasury and the Fed,” he &lt;a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/11/trump-doubles-down-on-fed-attacks-saying-its-going-loco.html\"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; at the time. “The Fed is going loco and there’s no reason for them to do it. I’m not happy about it.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Beautiful, clean coal” industry won’t be getting its bailout just yet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And after all &lt;strong&gt;Rick Perry’s&lt;/strong&gt; hard work! &lt;a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2018/10/15/rick-perry-coal-rescue-trump-850528\"&gt;Per Politico&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The White House directed Perry to “prepare immediate steps to stop the loss” of retiring coal and nuclear plants more than four months ago, and Trump even interrupted an Ohio fund-raiser in May to order an aide to call Perry to talk about the bailout. He also touted the national security benefits of coal a few months later at another West Virginia speech. . . . But the White House has shelved the plan amid opposition from the president’s own advisers on the National Security Council and National Economic Council, according to four people with knowledge of the discussions.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;“The problem they’ve got is every option they might consider raises the costs for somebody at a time when nobody has an appetite for increased costs anywhere,” &lt;strong&gt;Bob Coward,&lt;/strong&gt; co-leader of energy advisory firm MPR Associates, told Politico. “I think that’s the problem they keep running into. The political will to pay for it is not broadly there enough yet for them.” Still, the industry can’t be &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; mad at the president, who ditched the Paris climate accord last year and has pushing to just &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/08/trump-epa-just-going-to-let-beautiful-clean-coal-plants-regulate-themselves\"&gt;let coal plants to regulate themselves&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elsewhere!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Uber Proposals Value Company at $120 Billion in a Possible I.P.O.

Daniels&lt;/strong&gt; a small, petty win, just one day after her &lt;a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/15/admin/stormy-daniels-lawsuit-dismissed-trump.html\"&gt;defamation lawsuit against &lt;strong&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was dismissed by a federal judge in California&amp;#8212;and just a few hours after the president gloated about the case on Twitter, belligerently calling the adult-film star &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2018/10/maybe-donald-trump-isnt-an-insult-genius-after-all\"&gt;“horseface.”&lt;/a&gt; According to the A.P., the president’s &lt;em&gt;60 Minutes&lt;/em&gt; interview on Sunday night &lt;a href=\"http://twitter.com/ZekeJMiller/status/1052265511898279937\"&gt;reached&lt;/a&gt; 11.7 million viewers, just over half as many as Daniels pulled for her own blockbuster &lt;em&gt;60 Minutes&lt;/em&gt; interview back in March. Around 22 million viewers tuned in then to watch Daniels discuss her alleged 2006 affair with the president. That interview got the program’s highest ratings since a 2008 interview with &lt;strong&gt;Barack&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Michelle Obama.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Trump’s episode also flopped in comparison to his &lt;em&gt;60 Minutes&lt;/em&gt; interview in 2016, &lt;a href=\"https://deadline.com/2016/11/donald-trump-60-minutes-interview-ratings-rise-seahawks-patriots-sunday-night-football-rises-nbc-nfl-cbs-1201853888/\"&gt;which drew&lt;/a&gt; 20 million viewers. In the latest interview, conducted by &lt;strong&gt;Lesley Stahl,&lt;/strong&gt; Trump &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/donald-trump-60-minutes-interview\"&gt;was asked about&lt;/a&gt; an array of topics, from the tariffs he’s slapped on China to his relationship with North Korean dictator &lt;strong&gt;Kim Jong Un.&lt;/strong&gt; “I’m not a baby,” he said when Stahl rattled off a quick list of accusations surrounding Kim, pressing Trump to explain his adoration for the dictator. “I know these things.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The president also spoke about Dr. &lt;strong&gt;Christine Blasey Ford&lt;/strong&gt; and his Mississippi speech, the one in which he mimicked the professor and essentially accused her of lying about her sexual assault allegation against &lt;strong&gt;Brett Kavanaugh&lt;/strong&gt; (who denied the accusation). “I’m not gonna get into it because we won,” Trump said when asked if, in hindsight, he thought had been disrespectful toward Ford. “It doesn’t matter. We won.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;While his bombastic quotes hurtled around the Internet, one particular image from the interview also got attention: a painting that now hangs in the White House and shows Trump sitting at a table and having drinks with Republican presidents of the past, including Abraham Lincoln, Teddy Roosevelt, and Ronald Reagan. Titled “The Republican Club,” the piece is &lt;a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-hangs-tacky-fantasy-painting-of-himself-with-gop-presidents-in-white-house\"&gt;by artist &lt;strong&gt;Andy Thomas&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and was a gift to the president from Rep. &lt;strong&gt;Darrell Issa.&lt;/strong&gt; Viewers also got a glimpse at a jar full of &lt;a href=\"https://www.eater.com/2018/10/15/17977946/donald-trump-starburst-red-pink-60-minutes-interview\"&gt;red and pink Starburst candies&lt;/a&gt; within arm’s reach of Trump’s desk.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Sunday night, it turns out, was a bit of a ratings pit for Trumps across the board, including the president’s principle &lt;em&gt;Saturday Night Live&lt;/em&gt; mimicker, &lt;strong&gt;Alec Baldwin.&lt;/strong&gt; The actor’s new talk show, &lt;em&gt;The Alec Baldwin Show,&lt;/em&gt; debuted to a frail 2.2 million viewers.

Khashoggi.","body":"&lt;section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was, to be sure, a discomfiting scene: there was Secretary of State &lt;strong&gt;Mike Pompeo&lt;/strong&gt; amiably clutching the hand of Saudi Crown Prince &lt;strong&gt;Mohammed bin Salman&lt;/strong&gt; in an ornate meeting room in Riyadh a mere fortnight after &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; columnist and Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi had gone missing. The steady drumbeat of revelations had been perplexing and damning and almost inconceivable: the video evidence of Khashoggi entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul; the reports of a 15-person Saudi “kill” team landing in the city, including a so-called bone-saw expert; and &lt;strong&gt;Donald Trump’s&lt;/strong&gt; myriad equivocations. Yet as evidence increasingly suggested a connection between M.B.S. and the presumed murder, Pompeo’s visit seemed like the latest assault to diplomacy. Despite what should have been a somber, mordant affair, he looked like Ed McMahon about to present an oversize check before the camera. (On Friday night, the Saudis conceded what everyone had long known: Khashoggi was dead.)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Back in Washington, members of the diplomatic and intelligence community that I spoke with were gobsmacked. While Axios has &lt;a href=\"https://www.axios.com/saudi-arabia-mike-pompeo-meeting-jamal-khashoggi-1480d505-dcbc-46cb-97e0-34ba5a08655f.html\"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that Pompeo uttered harsh words beneath his avuncular civility, many found the optics insurmountable. “The grip and grin sort of stunned people who saw it,” a congressional aide told me. “There is a lack of confidence that he is doing everything in his power to actually get the truth in this case.” Among diplomatic veterans, Pompeo’s affable demeanor was a real misstep. “Pompeo did not handle this well,” a former high-ranking State Department official sighed. “I don’t think it would have been difficult to be more somber in meetings and more nuanced in comments afterward.” As one State department official lamented to me, “Certainly from where I sit, it is discouraging to see the administration seemingly subordinate our values to other interests in such an egregious case.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Since reports of Khashoggi’s disappearance first began to circulate, Trump has signaled that the death of one journalist&amp;#8212;a citizen of Saudi Arabia, not the United States&amp;#8212;was not worth rupturing the U.S.-Saudi relationship. Last week, the president said it would be a “very tough pill to swallow for our country” if the kingdom was found to be responsible for the assumed killing of Khashoggi, and a $110 billion U.S. arms sales deal with Saudi Arabia was correspondingly imperiled. And despite mounting evidence that M.B.S. was involved, Trump suggested as recently as Monday that “rogue killers” could have been behind the hit. “I have never seen anything quite like that, with the president playing the role of defense lawyer to someone who appears to have murdered a U.S. resident overseas in flagrant violation of every diplomatic norm,” &lt;strong&gt;Daniel Benaim,&lt;/strong&gt; who served as a Middle East adviser to Vice President &lt;strong&gt;Joe Biden,&lt;/strong&gt; told me. “Not to even pretend to have an interest in the rule of law, and to jump straight to the part where you whitewash others’ crimes, is a gross abdication of American values.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;“The president was making excuses for the Saudis. The president, normally, would never do that,” said another former high-ranking State Department official who served in the Middle East. Instead, this source explained, a typical president would stress the seriousness of the situation, praise Khashoggi and the free press, call for an investigation&amp;#8212;possibly by the United Nations&amp;#8212;and rally U.S. allies to consolidate intelligence. By no means would he or she have expressed concerns that the arms agreement could become collateral. “There would be no indication one way or the other of what we were going to be doing,” they said.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not hyperbole to suggest that the Trump administration’s handling of the M.B.S. matter could well define the second half of the president’s term. The U.S.-Saudi relationship impacts everything, on a meta level, from oil prices to the Middle East peace puzzle. More specifically, Saudi Arabia has used its vast sovereign wealth fund, the Public Investment Fund, to intertwine itself with the American financial community&amp;#8212;Saudi money flows through Uber, JPMorgan Chase, Blackstone, Snap, and, &lt;a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2018/10/16/shiny-hollywood-partnership-with-saudi-arabia-suddenly-thrown-its-head/?utm_term=.92779c3aadda\"&gt;until recently&lt;/a&gt;, William Morris Endeavor. It’s also a bulwark against a nuclear Iran, a sort of inelegant centerpiece of Israel’s defense.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;More so than during the early crises of his presidency, Trump appears to comprehend the complexity of it all, which may be what has rendered his administration’s response so limp. Earlier this month, Trump harangued on Twitter that M.B.S. was innocent until proven guilty, a similar refrain he had used to protect &lt;strong&gt;Brett Kavanaugh’s&lt;/strong&gt; nomination. In the end, he seems to be hoping that the whole thing will blow over.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This defensiveness largely falls flat among his fellow lawmakers. “Across the Hill, there is just absolute disgust at what seems to have taken place, and bewilderment over the way the administration has reacted. And I think that runs the gamut from people whose baseline position would be deeply skeptical of the U.S.-Saudi relationship to people who have been traditionally strong supporters of the U.S.-Saudi relationship,” the congressional staffer told me. “By and large, the reaction on the Hill is outrage, and an insistence that we get ourselves a full, clear accounting and a deep skepticism that the Saudis are investigating this on their own&amp;#8212;despite Secretary Pompeo’s assurances&amp;#8212;are really going to provide clarity.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Benaim distilled the dissonance. “Other administrations would certainly have struggled with how to balance America’s values and interests, given the way a case like this impacts both,” he told me. “But Donald Trump doesn’t seem to have that struggle.” Instead, Trump says the quiet part out loud. “In a funny way, what you see is Donald Trump basically adopting the left-wing critique of the U.S.-Saudi relationship&amp;#8212;which reduces a very complex situation with a lot of different variables&amp;#8212;to basically, ‘They can get away with murder, because they are going to buy our weapons.’ He is actually taking the leftist critique of the relationship&amp;#8212;and embracing it.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the Khashoggi drama has unfolded, the close relationship between M.B.S. and &lt;strong&gt;Jared Kushner,&lt;/strong&gt; Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, has come under renewed scrutiny. (&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/18/world/middleeast/jamal-khashoggi-killing-saudi-arabia.html\"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; this week that Kushner was advocating on M.B.S.’s behalf within the White House.) Their relationship dates back to the early days of Trump’s presidency, when &lt;strong&gt;Rex Tillerson&lt;/strong&gt; was still running the State Department. As &lt;strong&gt;Dexter Filkins&lt;/strong&gt; has &lt;a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/in-the-wake-of-khashoggis-disappearance-saudi-arabias-crown-prince-is-pushed-to-the-brink\"&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker,&lt;/em&gt; Kushner identified M.B.S. as a “change agent” in the region, and developed a relationship that effectively sidelined Tillerson. According to one former administration official, Kushner’s communications with M.B.S. over the encrypted messaging service WhatsApp were a point of contention within the administration, one that was partly assuaged when Kushner began providing screenshots of his conversations with the National Security Council. But, this person added, “It was still an after-the-fact thing.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In recent days, a number of sources I have spoken with have raised the possibility that M.B.S.’s ties to Kushner may have instilled in the crown prince a belief that America would, indeed, turn a blind eye to the murder of Khashoggi. “I think there is a lot to be said [about how] M.B.S. thought he could get away with it because Jared Kushner was in his pocket, and so was the president for that matter,” the former State Department official who worked in the Middle East said. And after all, the Trump administration has largely ignored the war in Yemen; the strange sojourn of Lebanese Prime Minister &lt;strong&gt;Saad Hariri&lt;/strong&gt; to Saudi Arabia; the ill-fated boycott of Qatar; and M.B.S.’s spats with Canada and Germany. “The Trump administration made it clear that he had a blank check, and so what do you do when you have a blank check? You write in the craziest sum imaginable and take it to the bank, and that is what he did,” Benaim told me. “Only it seems that the blank check has bounced&amp;#8212;at least with Congress, if not with the president.” (The White House did not respond to a request from comment.)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Whether Trump will yield to the pressure from Capitol Hill and the international community, or side with his son-in-law and his buddy, remains an open question. But if evidence indeed shows that M.B.S. was behind the death of Khashoggi, the crown prince will join the ranks of Syrian President &lt;strong&gt;Bashar al-Assad,&lt;/strong&gt; Russian President &lt;strong&gt;Vladimir Putin,&lt;/strong&gt; and North Korean dictator &lt;strong&gt;Kim Jong Un,&lt;/strong&gt; all of whom have engaged in extraterritorial murders to send a clear message to dissidents. Meanwhile, any remaining hope that M.B.S. is the idealist he’s claimed to be has rapidly dissipated. “I think there was legitimate hope when M.B.S. came on the scene that he was going to be a reformer, and he was going to change course,” the congressional aide told me. “And despite initial appearances and words to that effect, it is pretty clear that is not the case.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;","rubric":"Foreign Policy","socialTitle":"“Absolute Disgust”: Diplomats Fume Over Pompeo’s Saudi “Grip and Grin”","socialDescription":"Throughout Washington, people

president also took another shot at the reporters covering his rally.","body":"&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/strong&gt; has once again positioned himself against the #MeToo movement, mocking it during his Wednesday night rally in Pennsylvania. While reminiscing on his victory in the state in the 2016 presidential election&amp;#8212;like an old high-school quarterback revisiting the field over and over&amp;#8212;Trump stopped himself from using a certain expression, blaming “the rules of MeToo.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;“Pennsylvania hasn’t been won for many years by Republicans, but every Republican thinks they’re going to win Pennsylvania,” he said, &lt;a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/10/politics/trump-rally-mocks-me-too/index.html\"&gt;according to CNN&lt;/a&gt;. “I used an expression&amp;#8212;you know, there’s an expression, but under the rules of MeToo I’m not allowed to use that expression anymore. I can’t do it.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;He said the expression is akin to “the person that got away. See, in the old days, it was a little different.” When an audience member encouraged him to “do it anyway,” Trump laughed and pointed to the news cameras. “I would do it, except for these people up there. They would say, did you hear what President Trump said?”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;He continued, saying, “So there is an expression, but we’ll change the expression: Pennsylvania was always the person who got away. That’s pretty good, right? The person that got away?”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It’s unclear what Trump thinks the “rules” of #MeToo are. The movement, started by activist &lt;strong&gt;Tarana Burke,&lt;/strong&gt; began as a way for survivors of sexual misconduct to voice their pain and show solidarity with fellow survivors. It has sprawled into something greater, tied to the broader societal reckoning over sexual misconduct that &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/10/a-year-without-harvey-weinstein-oscar-monster\"&gt;began a year ago&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8212;but the message at its core has remained the same.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Trump, who has been accused of sexual misconduct himself multiple times (he has denied the claims), has made his stance clear on the growing movement. He first insulted it in July: while referring to Senator &lt;strong&gt;Elizabeth Warren&lt;/strong&gt; of Massachusetts, whom he has taken to calling “Pocahontas” because of her Native American heritage, Trump said he would like to send an ancestry kit her way. “We’ll take that little kit and say&amp;#8212;we have to do it gently because we are in the MeToo generation&amp;#8212;and we will very gently take that kit, slowly toss it [to her],” he said.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Last week, Trump also &lt;a href=\"http://time.com/5412955/donald-trump-says-scary-time-men-sexual-assault-allegations/\"&gt;told reporters&lt;/a&gt; that “it is a very scary time for young men in America, where you can be guilty of something you may not be guilty of”&amp;#8212;referring to the scandal surrounding &lt;strong&gt;Brett Kavanaugh&lt;/strong&gt; (who has since been sworn into the Supreme Court, despite sexual assault allegations he denied). “This is a very, very&amp;#8212;this is a very difficult time. What’s happening here has much more to do than even the appointment of a Supreme Court justice.”&lt;/p&gt;","rubric":"#MeToo","socialTitle":"Trump Mocks #MeToo Movement Days After Decrying “a Scary

disinformation campaign targeting Ted Cruz and Hillary Clinton.","body":"&lt;p&gt;At a time when the Russian government was escalating its efforts to help &lt;strong&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/strong&gt; win the presidency, &lt;strong&gt;Rick Gates,&lt;/strong&gt; then deputy chairman of the Trump campaign, was making inquiries of his own. Shortly after he joined the Trump campaign alongside &lt;strong&gt;Paul Manafort&lt;/strong&gt; in 2016, Gates sought proposals from an Israeli intelligence firm, Psy-Group, for social-media influence and opposition-research campaigns, &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/08/us/politics/rick-gates-psy-group-trump.html\"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Gates was first introduced to Psy-Group in March 2016, just days after he and Manafort joined the campaign to stave off a &lt;strong&gt;Ted Cruz&lt;/strong&gt;-led Republican revolt. &lt;strong&gt;George Birnbaum,&lt;/strong&gt; a longtime Republican operative who attended the introductory meeting at the Mandarin Oriental hotel in Washington, told the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; that Gates “was interested in finding the technology to achieve what they were looking for.” Gates reportedly sought a proposal targeting Cruz through the use of fake online personas, which was intended to corral 5,000 Republican delegates away from the Texas senator and toward Trump. Another proposal, per the &lt;em&gt;Times,&lt;/em&gt; described opposition research against &lt;strong&gt;Hillary Clinton.&lt;/strong&gt; A third mapped out a months-long plan to sow discord. Together, the proposals were labeled “Project Rome,” and referred to Trump, Clinton, and Cruz “Lion,” “Forest,” and “Bear,” respectively. In total, the work would have cost the Trump campaign $3 million. (A lawyer for Gates declined the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;’s request for comment.)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;While there is no evidence that the Trump campaign officially retained Psy-Group, &lt;strong&gt;Joel Zamel,&lt;/strong&gt; the head of the firm, did meet with &lt;strong&gt;Donald Trump Jr.&lt;/strong&gt; at Trump Tower in August 2016. &lt;strong&gt;George Nader,&lt;/strong&gt; a Lebanese-American businessman and adviser to Emirati Crown Prince &lt;strong&gt;Mohammed bin Zayed Al-Nahyan,&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Erik Prince,&lt;/strong&gt; the founder of Blackwater and brother of Education Secretary &lt;strong&gt;Betsy DeVos,&lt;/strong&gt; also attended that meeting, which was first [reported]https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/19/us/politics/trump-jr-saudi-uae-nader-prince-zamel.html) by the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; in May. Nader and Zamel have provided conflicting accounts as to whether Psy-Group worked with the Trump campaign. Employees at the intelligence firm told the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; that Zamel requested an updated “Project Rome” proposal ahead of the Trump Tower meeting. But &lt;strong&gt;Marc Mukasey,&lt;/strong&gt; a lawyer for Zamel, denied that his client ever discussed specific proposals with Trump Jr. or Trump campaign officials. “Mr. Zamel never pitched, or otherwise discussed, any of Psy-Group’s proposals relating to the U.S. elections with anyone related to the Trump campaign, including . . . Donald Trump Jr., except for outlining the capabilities of some of his companies in general terms,” he said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Trump Tower meeting was not the first time Zamel’s name surfaced in connection with the Russia probe. Back in May, a &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/05/the-dark-truth-about-cambridge-analyticas-ties-to-trumpworld\"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; alleged that Psy-Group inked a business deal with &lt;strong&gt;Robert Mercer&lt;/strong&gt;-backed data firm Cambridge Analytica in December 2016; the deal reportedly “outline[d] a partnership whereby the two firms could cooperate on a case-by-case basis to provide intelligence and social-media services,” the aim of which was, in part, to help both companies win government contracts. A source told the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt; that the deal was signed “without Mr. Zamel’s involvement,” but the existence of the deal drew yet another link between the Russia probe’s fringe players.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Gates/Psy-Group saga, too, is something of a &lt;em&gt;Who’s Who&lt;/em&gt; of &lt;strong&gt;Robert Mueller’s&lt;/strong&gt; investigation: Gates, of course, cut a plea deal with Mueller’s team, and Nader is reportedly cooperating with the special counsel. Prince has also been ensnared in the investigation, for his involvement in a January 2017 Seychelles meeting, and has previously said that he cooperated with Mueller. People familiar with the matter told the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; that Mueller has obtained copies of the various proposals Gates perused, and that he is particularly interested in a $2 million payment Nader made to Zamel after the 2016 election.&lt;/p&gt;","rubric":"Mueller Investigation","socialTitle":"Rick Gates Sought Israeli Help to Crush Trump’s Opponents","socialDescription":"The

problem with suburban women.","body":"&lt;p&gt;The emergence of &lt;strong&gt;Dina Powell&lt;/strong&gt; as the presumed front-runner to replace &lt;strong&gt;Nikki Haley&lt;/strong&gt; at the United Nations was received with unusual bipartisan acceptance, at least as far as Trump political nominees are concerned. “If it is Dina Powell, I would guess she gets support from several Democrats,” a Democratic Senate aide told me Wednesday. “It sure looks like it will be Dina Powell and everyone will be like, ‘O.K., that sounds right,’ and that will be it.” After serving as National Security Adviser &lt;strong&gt;H.R. McMaster’s&lt;/strong&gt; deputy and holding multiple positions in the &lt;strong&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/strong&gt; State Department, Powell would be well qualified&amp;#8212;more so than Haley was when she became the U.S. ambassador to the U.N. But by Thursday afternoon, Powell had reportedly informed her bosses at Goldman Sachs, where she serves as an executive on the bank’s management committee, that she wasn’t interested in the job.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;With Powell out of contention, there is no clear favorite to succeed Haley in Turtle Bay. Further complicating matters, Politico &lt;a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2018/10/11/trump-gender-gap-un-895498\"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;, White House aides are pushing &lt;strong&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/strong&gt; to tap a woman for the job in order to shore up support within a critical demographic ahead of the November midterms. It is not an idle concern: publicly, Republican leaders have argued that the bruising Supreme Court confirmation battle over &lt;strong&gt;Brett Kavanaugh,&lt;/strong&gt; who faced multiple allegations of sexual misconduct, helped energize the G.O.P. base. (Kavanaugh denied all the allegations against him.) And initially, polls did indeed reflect a slight uptick in enthusiasm among Republican voters. But in the days since, the numbers have told a different story. The percentage of women who view Kavanaugh negatively jumped 20 points to 53 percent between August and October, &lt;a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/08/politics/cnn-poll-kavanaugh-confirmation/index.html\"&gt;according&lt;/a&gt; to a CNN poll released Thursday. Trump himself has an abysmal disapproval rating of 63 percent among women voters.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Trumpworld seems aware of the political ramifications, and views the U.N. posting as a potential remedy. “The political shop thinks it’s very important to announce a woman before Election Day because of the president’s approval rating and the Kavanaugh stuff,” one source in regular contact with the president told Politico.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The appointment, after all, is as much about optics as it is about policy. As the Democratic Senate aide observed when Haley announced her resignation, Trump keeps most of his political appointees on a tight leash. “I don’t think it is that big of a deal, to be honest with you. . . . Is the new U.N. ambassador going to come in and fundamentally change the Trump administration’s foreign policy? I don’t think anyone thinks that,” this person told me. “Nikki Haley was more interesting politically than policy-wise.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Of course, the notion that appointing a woman to serve as the U.S. ambassador to the U.N. would offset Trump’s unpopularity among suburban women voters may be wishful thinking, given the ground he must make up. “Democrats’ chances of taking the majority are squarely within those moderate suburban districts,” explained &lt;strong&gt;Steve Israel,&lt;/strong&gt; a former New York congressman and chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. “Look at the energy. The day after Trump’s inaugural, moderate women who did not vote in 2016 took to the streets. That’s the first bookend. The final bookend will be in the midterm elections, when you take to the polls.” Anywhere you look, he said, “you see nuclear energy among Democrats, and the Kavanaugh nomination brought it to even higher levels.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Republican strategist &lt;strong&gt;Terry Sullivan,&lt;/strong&gt; who ran Senator &lt;strong&gt;Marco Rubio’s&lt;/strong&gt; 2016 presidential campaign, concurred that Haley’s replacement will be largely inconsequential in November. “It will have almost zero impact on the midterms,” he told me. But he added that from a longer-term perspective, appointing a woman to the job could help Trump. “He needs more female validators in there for his re-election in 2020,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;With Powell out of the running, the list of women under consideration to replace Haley reportedly includes &lt;strong&gt;Nancy Brinker,&lt;/strong&gt; the founder of the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation; former New Hampshire senator &lt;strong&gt;Kelly Ayotte;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Kelly Knight Craft,&lt;/strong&gt; the U.S. ambassador to Canada; and &lt;strong&gt;Kay Bailey Hutchison,&lt;/strong&gt; the current U.S. ambassador to NATO. Of these women, Ayotte is perhaps the most intriguing possibility. As Sullivan explained, Ayotte is viewed within Republican circles as “smart, competent, and a great face for the G.O.P.” As a suburban working mom, she fits the exact demographic the Republican Party is struggling to hold on to in the Trump era. Her previously fraught relationship with Trump could be a sticking point. But then again, she did shepherd Supreme Court Justice &lt;strong&gt;Neil Gorsuch&lt;/strong&gt; through his Senate confirmation process. Haley herself backed Rubio in the 2016 primary race and once gave candidate Trump the South Carolina equivalent of the middle finger: “Bless your heart.”&lt;/p&gt;","rubric":"Trump

a &lt;a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/16/politics/elizabeth-warren-donald-trump-pocahontas/index.html\"&gt;DNA test&lt;/a&gt; aimed at proving her ancestry, &lt;strong&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/strong&gt; seemed to be feeling emboldened, and tried out a new insult for yet another woman who’s gotten on his nerves in public. On Tuesday morning, Trump &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1052213711295930368\"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; at Fox News about the most recent update in his lawsuit with &lt;strong&gt;Stormy Daniels,&lt;/strong&gt; and gave her a new nickname in the process.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"&gt;&lt;blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1052213711295930368\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1052213711295930368\"&gt;https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1052213711295930368&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It came hours after &lt;a href=\"https://www.axios.com/donald-trump-nicknames-pocahontas-elizabeth-warren-de41115c-f8fe-4193-b0db-1755d9fc3489.html\"&gt;Axios&lt;/a&gt; went out of their way to praise Trump’s “wickedly effective” use of the name “Pocahontas” to target Warren, claiming that “Trump’s nicknames slyly capitalize on and exacerbate a real or perceived weakness.” Daniels, however, must be a more slippery target; the nickname “Horseface” is mean, like all the other Trump nicknames, but not particularly cutting or revelatory. (It’s no “Liddle Marco,” that’s for sure.)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And it may be Daniels who set the tone for this debate in the first place, starting with the “mushroom head” excerpt from her memoir, and continuing with her firing back at Trump on Twitter on Tuesday:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;https://twitter.com/stormydaniels/status/1052224021855637505?s=21&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Is Trump just stooping to her level for a taunt any seventh grader would pass on for being too obvious? Or is he revealing what he’s been all along&amp;#8212;no secret genius, of nicknames or otherwise, but a bored man &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/ddale8/status/1052216885184516096\"&gt;watching Fox

His bid to save his nomination on Fox, where he portrayed himself as something of a choirboy, the president viewed as limp. He liked Kavanaugh’s pugilism at last Friday’s hearing, but he was taken aback by all the talk of beer. “I watched that hearing, and I watched a man saying that he did have difficulty as a young man with drink,” Trump told reporters. A few hours later, he was back to praising &lt;strong&gt;Christine Blasey Ford&lt;/strong&gt; and taking a wait-and-see approach&amp;#8212;he wasn’t about to expend political capital saving Kavanaugh’s apparently sinking nomination. And, he couldn’t help mentioning, he himself had never had even one beer, being a teetotaler.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Trump’s &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/donald-trump-attacks-christine-ford-brett-kavanaugh\"&gt;mocking&lt;/a&gt; of Dr. Ford from the rally stage in Mississippi on Tuesday night seemed a characteristically undisciplined outburst, a reversion to form, and it drew rebukes from key Republican senators who would decide Kavanaugh’s fate. But it was probably a result of an evolving calculation of the political forces that, more than the nomination, would shape the midterms. Advisers including Deputy Chief of Staff &lt;strong&gt;Bill Shine&lt;/strong&gt; and outside allies &lt;strong&gt;Corey Lewandowski&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;David Bossie&lt;/strong&gt; had been imploring Trump to get more aggressive on behalf of his Supreme Court nominee, sources said. “Defending Kavanaugh is a culture-war issue for Republicans that divides and splits the Democrats,” one Republican close to the White House said. “The problem has always been: how do we turn out the G.O.P. base?”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Kavanaugh, the West Wing realized, was a wedge issue, tailor-made for the struggle at hand, and by the end of the week, after a hamstrung F.B.I. investigation gave Republicans enough cover, Trump went all in. At a rally in Minnesota on Thursday night, Trump told supporters, “Democrats have been trying to destroy Judge Brett Kavanaugh since the very first second he was announced.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;According to sources, Trump advisers feel they’ve found a winning message that will help them hold the Senate and, in what might be magical thinking, keep the House. “It’s a political issue, and he’s going to take it to the next level. That’s how you get the G.O.P. base, which is 60-plus percent white male, to vote,” the Republican close to the White House said. Trump hinted at this strategy on Thursday night. “All you have to do is look at the polls over the last three or four days, and it shows that their rage-fueled resistance is starting to backfire at a level that nobody has ever seen before,” he told rally goers.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Advisers say Trump’s mood has improved significantly this week, which in raw political terms, has been one of the best of his presidency. He scored big wins with a new Canada-Mexico trade deal and 3.7 percent unemployment numbers. “His optimism is very high,” one former West Wing official said. “I’m seeing it in the polling&amp;#8212;there’s electricity in the air for Republicans,” said another former West Wing official. (One minor annoyance: Kavanaugh’s &lt;a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/i-am-an-independent-impartial-judge-1538695822\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; op-ed. “Trump thought it was too apologetic,” said one outside adviser to the White House.)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But as good as this week was for Trump, investing his political future in a deeply unpopular judge who’s been credibly accused of sexual assault is a sign of the relativity of expectations in Trumpworld. “Folks are just focused on surviving,” one prominent Republican said.&lt;/p&gt;","rubric":"White House","socialTitle":"“Folks Are Just Focused on Surviving”: Trump Bets on Kavanaugh to Save the G.O.P.","socialDescription":"Blasting Christine Blasey Ford was a calculated move to stir the passions of his base.

It’s a trick. It must be a trick and a trap. The collection of art that President &lt;strong&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/strong&gt; has gathered over the years is the finale in the mouse-and-human game he’s been playing with us, the American people, his royal subjects. He’s trying to out us all as snobs.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Listen, are we snobs? You bet. I, for one, am a big-time, &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt; snob. But the whole joy of snobbery is silent judgment. We snobs delight in walking through the world with no more than a little wrinkle to one’s side of the mouth when presented with offending items&amp;#8212;pronouncing the “h” in hors d’oeuvres, not pronouncing the “h” in &lt;em&gt;jamón,&lt;/em&gt; chardonnay, cheese before dinner rather than after, Impressionism, etcetera. At most, a true snob will let loose a droll comment said to no one in particular. And yet, Trump is making it impossible to do anything but yell about his art.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;His art, his art, where do we start? Let’s begin with the freshest knife to the heart: in his &lt;em&gt;60 Minutes&lt;/em&gt; interview on Sunday night, Trump and &lt;strong&gt;Lesley Stahl&lt;/strong&gt; were walking through the White House talking about&amp;#8212;I don’t know&amp;#8212;the midterms, when they paused in front of a painting. Or it looked like a painting. It was, in fact, a print of presidents Abraham Lincoln, Teddy Roosevelt, Dwight Eisenhower, Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan, and both Bushes around a table, laughing. At the center of it all is a svelte and smiling Donald Trump. It is surely the image one sees before one dies, but more importantly, it is a print.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"&gt;&lt;blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/jbillinson/status/1051627281687478272?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/jbillinson/status/1051627281687478272?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\"&gt;https://twitter.com/jbillinson/status/1051627281687478272?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A print! In the White House! &lt;em&gt;The Republican Club,&lt;/em&gt; as it’s known, is by &lt;strong&gt;Andy Thomas,&lt;/strong&gt; and it came to live in those hallowed halls thanks to &lt;strong&gt;Darrell Issa,&lt;/strong&gt; the California Republican representative who owns a &lt;a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2018/10/15/all-we-know-about-white-house-portrait-trump-drinking-diet-coke-with-abraham-lincoln/?utm_term=.eae6fa7b7413\"&gt;couple&lt;/a&gt; Thomas paintings. The largest version available is 30 by 45 and costs $1,700.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To further expose the snobs, the kitschy print he chose was created by a fine, nice enough, normal-seeming guy. Thomas is a self-taught painter from Missouri. He has made several paintings of groups of presidents doing activities together, including a Democratic presidents one that is &lt;a href=\"https://andythomas.com/product/the-democratic-club/\"&gt;just as terrifying&lt;/a&gt;. The artist told &lt;a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2018/10/15/all-we-know-about-white-house-portrait-trump-drinking-diet-coke-with-abraham-lincoln/\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that he wants everyone looking their best, which is why all the presidents are glowing and in shape and smiling good-naturedly about all those war crimes or something. And in both, he’s added a blurry-faced female wraith in a sensible sports jacket&amp;#8212;a future female president the world does not yet know, as &lt;a href=\"http://time.com/5198306/andy-thomas-donald-trump-presidents-painting/\"&gt;Thomas told &lt;em&gt;Time&lt;/em&gt; magazine&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year. His prints do well in gift shops.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But this isn’t the only move in Trump’s everlasting game of 3-D art chess. Last year, journalist &lt;strong&gt;Tim O’Brien&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/10/donald-trumps-fake-renoir\"&gt;recalled interviewing Trump&lt;/a&gt; “years ago” on his private jet. They got into a brief disagreement about whether the clearly fake Renoir hung in the aircraft was real. (The painting, called &lt;em&gt;Two Sisters (On the Terrace),&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/artwork/14655\"&gt;hangs&lt;/a&gt; at the Art Institute of Chicago now, as it did then.) O’Brien saw the same reproduction in Trump Tower during another &lt;em&gt;60 Minutes&lt;/em&gt; interview in 2016, after Trump had been elected president.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And who could forget the &lt;a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/a-time-magazine-with-trump-on-the-cover-hangs-in-his-golf-clubs-its-fake/2017/06/27/0adf96de-5850-11e7-ba90-f5875b7d1876_story.html?utm_term=.957bbcd0c1f8\"&gt;false &lt;em&gt;Time&lt;/em&gt; cover hung in at least five of his golf clubs&lt;/a&gt;, the one that showed him crossing his arms and looking stern under the words that scream in a way that snobs &lt;em&gt;do not,&lt;/em&gt; “TRUMP IS HITTING ON ALL FRONTS . . . EVEN TV!”? Yes, he was always up to tricks, daring golf snobs to say, “Heyyy, wait a minute, guy. Is that really you on that real cover?” Actually, that is Good Art.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;When Trump moved into the White House, he had no need to rely on fake art, reproductions, or prints; the Obamas, for example, &lt;a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2017/01/23/510601240/how-a-work-of-art-makes-it-onto-the-wall-of-the-white-house\"&gt;borrowed works from the National Gallery of Art&lt;/a&gt; to hang in their spaces, as is the custom, and added where they could to the White House’s permanent collection. To acquire pieces, permanent or on loan, the families have the help of the White House Historical Association, a nonprofit that raises the money needed to refurbish and decorate the home from administration to administration, among others.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Which brings us to a strange development: the curator of the White House suspiciously disappeared in 2017. After serving eight presidents and First Ladies over 40 years, just &lt;em&gt;gone.&lt;/em&gt; The party line was that &lt;a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/reliable-source/wp/2017/05/09/white-house-curator-to-retire-after-working-with-first-families-for-decades/?utm_term=.fb900df6ba80\"&gt;he had been “thinking about” retirement&lt;/a&gt;, but stayed on to “help” the Trumps “navigate their first months in the executive mansion.” It was many months later that the White House walls started displaying a print of a painting that replaces those poker-playing dogs with old, powerful men and one lurking woman.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So what’s going on here? Why is President Trump, a man of taste, a man who would not &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; this without good reason, doing this? One word, two syllables: midterms. The midterms! He’s doing a thing where he pretends to be gauche and self-obsessed to expose all the snobs right before the midterms, and laughs and laughs, much like noted good-time guy Richard Nixon in this painting. He’s exposing all the snobby snobs as they come out of the woodwork to yell at the top of their blown gaskets, “It’s too easy! You’re making it too easy to laugh at you, and it’s actually exasperating at this point!”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It’s that, or President Trump thinks that the portrait depicts actual events, and so it’s a very important historical piece to have in his home. It’s a toss-up, really.&lt;/p&gt;","rubric":"Trump l&amp;#39;oeil","socialTitle":"President Trump’s Love of Bad Art Is a Trick for Liberal Snobs, Right?","socialDescription":"He’s doing a thing where

policy.","promoDek":"Senior staffers are constantly scrambling to turn the president’s bald-faced lies into policy.","body":"&lt;p&gt;As you’ve probably noticed by now, &lt;strong&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/strong&gt; has a penchant for saying things that are not true, or what laymen would call “lying through his caps.” Having a compulsive liar as president would be hard enough for the staff of any administration to contend with. But in Trump’s case, the problem is compounded by the fact that he routinely and publicly spews such falsehoods wherever he sees fit (rallies, Twitter, Rose Garden press conferences), and then, because he essentially lives in a parallel universe, believes them to be true. When confronted by reporters about these claims, another administration might say, “Well, that‘s not entirely the case,” or, “What the president meant was . . . ” But this is no such administration! Instead, Trump’s staff&amp;#8212;and his Republican allies on Capitol Hill&amp;#8212;have scrambled to support his bogus talking points after the fact.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The most recent example of this phenomenon is the president’s claim over the weekend that middle-class Americans will receive a 10-percent tax cut &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; the midterm elections. According to &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/in-the-service-of-whim-officials-scramble-to-make-trumps-false-assertions-real/2018/10/23/0c271586-d6de-11e8-83a2-d1c3da28d6b6_story.html\"&gt;“neither officials on Capitol Hill nor in his administration knew anything about such a tax cut”&lt;/a&gt;, but that didn’t stop Trump from digging in further, telling supporters at a rally on Monday night in Houston, “We’re going to be putting in a 10 percent tax cut for middle-income families. It’s going to be put in next week. We’ve been working on it for a few months.” To be clear, not only did no one outside the voices in Trump’s head know anything about this new tax cut, but it would literally be impossible to enact a cut before midterms, as such things require legislation, and Congress will not be back in session until &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; November 6. But in Trumpworld, the constraints of time and space aren’t a problem!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Washington’s bureaucratic machinery whirred into action nonetheless&amp;#8212;working to produce a policy that could be seen as supporting Trump’s whim.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;One such option now under discussion by administration officials is a symbolic nonbinding “resolution” designed to signal to voters ahead of the elections that if Republicans hold their congressional majorities they might pass a future 10 percent tax cut for the middle class. And House Ways and Means Committee Chairman &lt;strong&gt;Kevin Brady&lt;/strong&gt; (R-Tex.) said Tuesday that he would work with the White House and the Treasury Department to develop a plan “over the coming weeks.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The mystery tax cut is only the latest instance of the federal government scrambling to reverse engineer policies to meet Trump’s sudden public promises&amp;#8212;or to search for evidence buttressing his conspiracy theories and falsehoods.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Another prime example, which also unfolded this week, involves President Twitter’s &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1054351078328885248\"&gt;claims&lt;/a&gt; that “criminals and unknown Middle Easterners are mixed in” to groups of Central Americans crossing the border between Mexico and the U.S. Did he have any proof? Of course not! Nevertheless, by the end of the day, White House press secretary &lt;strong&gt;Sarah Huckabee Sanders&lt;/strong&gt; was telling reporters that the president “absolutely“ had evidence to support his claim, citing a statistic of dubious origins that every day 10 suspected or known terrorists attempt to enter the U.S. illegally, which of course wasn’t even the original lie. &lt;strong&gt;Mike Pence&lt;/strong&gt; played along, too, &lt;a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/pence-seeks-to-bolster-trumps-unsubstantiated-claim-of-middle-easterners-in-a-migrant-caravan/2018/10/23/048ce726-d6d2-11e8-83a2-d1c3da28d6b6_story.html\"&gt;claiming&lt;/a&gt; during a &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; event Tuesday that “there are statistics on this,” and that “it’s inconceivable that there are not people of Middle Eastern descent in a crowd of more than 7,000 people advancing toward our border . . . In the last fiscal year, we apprehended more than 10 terrorists or suspected terrorists per day at our southern border from countries that are referred to in the lexicon as ‘other than Mexico.’ That means from the Middle East region.” Shortly thereafter, Trump threw both Pence and Sanders under the bus, telling reporters in the Oval Office, “There’s no proof of anything. But there could very well be.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The president’s declaration that the Pentagon would be creating a “Space Force” (news to the Pentagon at the time), and his threat to impose auto tariffs, likewise sent his staff scrambling to implement retroactive plans: Pence himself has since been tasked with overseeing said force, and a plan for the tariffs subsequently materialized at the Commerce Department. And of course, there’s the all-time classic: the formal commission that was formed on the basis of Trump’s completely groundless claim that he only lost the popular vote in 2016 due to widespread voter fraud. (The panel was eventually &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/01/trump-voter-fraud-commission\"&gt;disbanded&lt;/a&gt;.) “Virtually no one on the planet has the kind of power that a president of the United States has to scramble bureaucracies in the service of whim,” &lt;strong&gt;Kathleen Hall Jamieson,&lt;/strong&gt; director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania, told the &lt;em&gt;Post.&lt;/em&gt; “Whatever Donald Trump wakes up and thinks about, or whatever comes to mind in the middle of a speech, actually has the reality in that it is actionable in some odd sense.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Moreover, at least some of Trump’s staffers are fully aware that they’re bullshitting the American people&amp;#8212;they just don’t seem to care. “It doesn’t matter if it’s 100 percent accurate,” a senior Trump administration official &lt;a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/trumps-own-teams-know-his-caravan-claims-arent-true-dont-particularly-care\"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; the Daily Beast of the president’s immigration fear-mongering. “This is the play.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;More Great Stories from &lt;em&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212; Uber wants to be the next Amazon; but it &lt;a

Holding court before a gaggle of reporters outside the White House as Marine One idled on the South Lawn, Trump unleashed a dizzying sequence of half-truths and fairy tales, because he is the president, and the reporters in front of him were not.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;“They have a lot of everybody in that group, it’s a horrible thing. And it’s a lot bigger than 5,000 people,” he said Monday afternoon, referring to a &lt;a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/10/22/659451264/as-migrant-caravan-winds-north-trump-vows-to-cut-aid-to-countries-theyre-fleeing\"&gt;massive caravan&lt;/a&gt; of Central American refugees currently plowing through Mexico en route to the U.S. (In fact, the migrant caravan is a lot &lt;a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/five-myths-about-honduran-caravan-debunked-n922806\"&gt;smaller&lt;/a&gt; than 5,000 people.) But rather than be content with a heaven-sent midterm talking point, Trump escalated. “Go into the middle of the caravan, take your cameras, and search. . . . You’re going to find MS-13, you’re going to find Middle Eastern, you’re going to find everything.” Criminals, knife-wielding murderers, potential Islamic extremists&amp;#8212;that completes Trump-midterm bingo.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There is, of course, no reason to believe that “Middle Easterners” are mixed up in the caravan of refugees fleeing violence from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, beyond the fact that it would be convenient for Trump if it were true. A former senior intelligence official &lt;a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/five-myths-about-honduran-caravan-debunked-n922806\"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; NBC News that there is no evidence of any Middle Eastern terrorists hiding in the caravan. The White House &lt;a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/22/trump-says-unknown-middle-easterners-are-mixed-in-migrant-caravan.html\"&gt;has not responded to requests for comment&lt;/a&gt; regarding any of Trump’s claims.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"&gt;&lt;blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/ksieff/status/1054382292368531456\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/ksieff/status/1054382292368531456\"&gt;https://twitter.com/ksieff/status/1054382292368531456&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, Trump continued his jazz riff of lies, doubling down on his &lt;a href=\"https://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/Trump-says-Californians-are-rioting-sanctuary-city-13324781.php\"&gt;false claim&lt;/a&gt; that Californians are “rioting” against “sanctuary cities,” which he first tossed out at a campaign rally over the weekend. “Take a look, they want to get out of sanctuary cities. Many places in California want to get out of sanctuary cities,” he told a reporter, who then asked exactly where the riots were. “Yeah, it is rioting in some cases,” he replied, and moved on, ignoring additional questions on the topic.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Trump could not avoid questions about Jamal Khashoggi, the Saudi exile and former &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; columnist who was killed in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul earlier this month&amp;#8212;but he could inflate the potential consequences of placing sanctions on his new friends in Riyadh. “I don&amp;#39;t want to lose a million jobs, I don’t want to lose $110 billion,” he said, referring to an arms deal that has actually only earned &lt;a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/12/politics/trump-khashoggi-saudi-arabia-arms-deal-sanctions/index.html\"&gt;$14.5 billion&lt;/a&gt; so far. “But it’s really $450 billion if you include other than military. So that’s very important. But we’re going to get to the bottom of it,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It’s not clear how the money at stake quadrupled in Trump’s mind, but then again, the president has a habit of inflating numbers when the mood strikes. On March 20, when the Saudi crown prince visited Washington, Trump claimed the arms deal would generate “over 40,000 jobs in the United States.” Last Saturday, that number &lt;a href=\"https://www.axios.com/donald-trump-jobs-math-saudi-arabia-arms-deal-0b421bda-7736-4bd3-9630-cb9f7e91f550.html\"&gt;jumped&lt;/a&gt; to 450,000 jobs, then to &lt;a href=\"https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-interview-fox-business-stuart-varney-october-17-2018\"&gt;500,000 jobs&lt;/a&gt;, then 600,000 jobs on Friday, and finally “over one million jobs” a few hours later, while visiting Luke Air Force Base in Arizona.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Arguably his most brazen falsehood, however, came in response to a question about &lt;strong&gt;Ted Cruz,&lt;/strong&gt; who Trump was flying out to Texas to support. “He’s not Lyin’ Ted anymore, he’s Beautiful Ted. I call him Texas Ted,” he said over the roar of helicopter blades, extolling the virtues of a man whose wife he’d insulted in the past. A reporter reminded him that he’d once accused Cruz’s father of being involved in the J.F.K. assassination, to which Trump replied: “I don’t regret anything, honestly. It all worked out very nicely.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Trump, at the very, &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; least, appeared to walk back an earlier fairy tale from Sunday, when he had baselessly asserted that he was “studying very deeply, around the clock, a major tax cut for middle-income people” that would come in “sometime around the first of November, maybe a little before that.” The &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/KasieDC/status/1054150609992142849\"&gt;one problem&lt;/a&gt;: Congress is not in session until after the election, and indeed, media outlets quickly reported that &lt;a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-20/trump-says-new-tax-cut-plan-may-come-days-before-november-vote?srnd=premium\"&gt;nobody in Washington had any idea what Trump was talking about&lt;/a&gt;. “I’m going through Congress. We won’t have time to do the vote,” he &lt;a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/22/politics/donald-trump-tax-cut-election/index.html\"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Monday, barreling through the sort of quotidian, blatant falsehood that might have been a major, years-long scandal for another president. The full conversation needs to be &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/ddale8/status/1054503698334969863\"&gt;seen to be believed&lt;/a&gt;, or not, as the case may be:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Reporter: You said “lower tax cuts.” You said that you wanted tax cuts\nby November 1. Congress isn’t even in session. How is that possible?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Trump: No, we’re going to be passing&amp;#8212;no, no. We’re putting in a\nresolution sometime in the next week, or week and a half, two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Reporter: A resolution where?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Trump: “We’re going to put in&amp;#8212;we’re giving a middle-income tax\nreduction of about 10 percent. We’re doing it now for middle-income\npeople. This is not for business; this is for middle. That’s on top of\nthe tax decrease that we’ve already given them.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Reporter: Are you signing an executive order for that?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Trump: No, no, no. I’m going through Congress.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Reporter: But Congress isn’t in session, though.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Trump: We won’t have time to do the vote. We’ll do the vote later.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Reporter: Congress is out.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Running out of room to maneuver, Trump concedes there was never going to be a new tax-cut bill before November 6. Still, he concludes, “We’ll do the vote after the election.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"embed cneembed\"&gt;&lt;div class=\"embed block cneembed\"
