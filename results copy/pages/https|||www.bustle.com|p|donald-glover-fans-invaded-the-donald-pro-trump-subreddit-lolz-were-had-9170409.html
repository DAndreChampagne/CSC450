RazorRamonReigns wrote, "Make America Glover Again," making a joke on Make America Great Again, Trump's slogan during the campaign. </p><p>The Redditors are trying to make sense of things, too.

The video and song use the candor of trap to ground the rapture of black joy, and thus the ambivalence of the United States’ relation to blackness. “Are we your blessing or your bane?” Glover seems to ask. It’s an urgent and worthwhile question.</blockquote><div class="an"><div class="nH"><div class="nI"></div></div><cite class="af">ChildishGambinoVEVO on YouTube</cite></div><p>As for Reddit, even if Glover does officially take over this subreddit, there are others that are dedicated to the president. The "America First!" subreddit is one of the biggest, and it's also known as The_Donald. There are 610,000 "patriots" who subscribe to it. </p><p>The details of the community read, "The_Donald is a never-ending rally dedicated to the 45th President of the United States, Donald J. Trump." For Glover fans to take this one over, they would need significantly more support than they currently have on The Donald.</p><p>One of the latest posts on the pro-Trump page is <a class="ab"
