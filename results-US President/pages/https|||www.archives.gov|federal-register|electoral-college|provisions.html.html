<p><strong>Article II</strong> </p>



<p>Section 1. The executive Power shall be vested in a President of the

 United States of America. He shall hold his Office during the Term of four 

Years, and, together with the Vice President, chosen for the same Term,

be elected, as follows <br />



<a name="clause2"></a>Each State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may

 direct, a Number of Electors, equal to the whole Number of Senators and

Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress: but 

no Senator or Representative, or Person holding an Office of Trust or Profit 

under the United States, shall be appointed an Elector.</p>


<hr />



<p>The Congress may determine the Time of choosing the Electors, and the

 Day on which they shall give their Votes; which Day shall be the same throughout

the United States. </p>



<hr />



<p><strong><a name="12"></a>Twelfth Amendment</strong> </p>



<p>The Electors shall meet in their respective states, and vote by ballot 

for President and Vice-President, one of whom, at least, shall not be an

 inhabitant of the same state with themselves; they shall name in their

 ballots the person voted for as President, and in distinct ballots the

person voted for as Vice-President, and they shall make distinct lists

of all persons voted for as President, and of all persons voted for as 

Vice-President, and of the number of votes for each, which lists they shall 

sign and certify, and transmit sealed to the seat of the government of

the United States, directed to the President of the Senate; The President 

of the Senate shall, in the presence of the Senate and House of Representatives, 

open all the certificates and the votes shall then be counted;--The person

 having the greatest number of votes for President, shall be the President, 

if such number be a majority of the whole number of Electors appointed;

and if no person have such majority, then from the persons having the highest

numbers not exceeding three on the list of those voted for as President,

the House of Representatives shall choose immediately, by ballot, the President.

 But in choosing the President, the votes shall be taken by states, the 

representation from each state having one vote; a quorum for this purpose 

shall consist of a member or members from two-thirds of the states, and 

a majority of all the states shall be necessary to a choice.... The

 person having the greatest number of votes as Vice-President, shall be 

the Vice-President, if such number be a majority of the whole number of

Electors appointed, and if no person have a majority, then from the two 

highest numbers on the list, the Senate shall choose the Vice-President;

a quorum for the purpose shall consist of two-thirds of the whole number

of Senators, and a majority of the whole number shall be necessary to a 

choice. But no person constitutionally ineligible to the office of President 

shall be eligible to that of Vice-President to the United States. </p>



<p><strong>Fourteenth Amendment</strong> </p>



<p>Section 3. No person shall be... elector of President and Vice President

... who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or 

as an officer of the United States, or as a member of any State legislature,

or as an executive or judicial officer of any State, to support the Constitution

 of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against 

the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof. But Congress 

may by a vote of two-thirds of each House, remove such disability. </p>



<p><strong>Fifteenth Amendment</strong> </p>



<p>Section 1. The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account 

of race, color, or previous condition of servitude. </p>



<hr />



<p><strong>Nineteenth Amendment</strong> </p>



<p>The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied

 or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex. </p>



<hr />



<p><a name="20"></a><strong>Twentieth Amendment</strong> </p>



<p>Section 1. The terms of the President and Vice President shall end at 

noon on the 20th day of January, and the terms of Senators and Representatives

at noon on the 3d day of January, of the years in which such terms would

 have ended if this article had not been ratified; and the terms of their

 successors shall then begin. </p>



<p>Section 2. The Congress shall assemble at least once in every year,

and such meeting shall begin at noon on the 3d day of January, unless they 

shall by law appoint a different day. </p>

<p>Section 3. If, at the time fixed for the beginning of the term of the

 President, the President elect shall have died, the Vice President elect 

shall become President. If a President shall not have been chosen before 

the time fixed for the beginning of his term, or if the President elect

 shall have failed to qualify, then the Vice President elect shall act as

President until a President shall have qualified; and the Congress may 

by law provide for the case wherein neither a President elect nor a Vice

 President elect shall have qualified, declaring who shall then act as President,

or the manner in which one who is to act shall be selected, and such person

 shall act accordingly until a President or Vice President shall have qualified. </p>



<p>Section 4. The Congress may by law provide for the case of the death 

of any of the persons from whom the House of Representatives may choose

 a President whenever the right of choice shall have devolved upon them,

and for the case of the death of any of the persons from whom the Senate 

may choose a Vice President whenever the right of choice shall have devolved

upon them. </p>



<hr />



<p><strong>Twenty-Second Amendment</strong> </p>



<p>Section 1. No person shall be elected to the office of the President 

more than twice, and no person who has held the office of President, or

 acted as President, for more than two years of a term to which some other 

person was elected President shall be elected to the office of the President 

more than once. But this Article shall not apply to any person holding 

the office of President when this Article was proposed by the Congress,

and shall not prevent any person who may be holding the office of President,

or acting as President, during the term within which this Article becomes 

operative from holding the office of President or acting as President during

 the remainder of such term. </p>



<hr />



<p><strong><a name="23"></a>Twenty-Third Amendment</strong> </p>



<p>Section 1. The District constituting the seat of Government of the United 

States shall appoint in such manner as the Congress may direct: <br />



A number of electors of President and Vice President equal to the whole

 number of Senators and Representatives in Congress to which the District 

would be entitled if it were a State, but in no event more than the least 

populous State; they shall be in addition to those appointed by the States,

 but they shall be considered, for the purposes of the election of President

 and Vice President, to be electors appointed by a State; and they shall 

meet in the District and perform such duties as provided by the twelfth

 article of amendment. </p>



<hr />

Fourth. They shall forthwith cause the other of the certificates and lists

<p><strong>Failure of certificates of electors to reach president of the 

senate or archivist of the United States; demand on state for certificate</strong> </p>



<p><a name="12a"></a>§ 12. When no certificate of vote and list mentioned 

in sections 9 and 11 and of this title from any State shall have been received 

by the President of the Senate or by the Archivist of the United States 

by the fourth Wednesday in December, after the meeting of the electors 

shall have been held, the President of the Senate or, if he be absent from 

the seat of government, the Archivist of the United States shall request, 

by the most expeditious method available, the secretary of state of the

 State to send up the certificate and list lodged with him by the electors 

of such State; and it shall be his duty upon receipt of such request immediately 

to transmit same by registered mail to the President of the Senate at the  

seat of government. </p>



<p><strong>Same; demand on district judge for certificate</strong> </p>



<p><a name="13"></a>§ 13. When no certificates of votes from any State

 has been lodged, and such judge shall forthwith transmit that list by the 

hand of such messenger to the seat of government. </p>

<p>§ 14. Every person who, having been appointed, pursuant to section

to the President of the Senate, and having accepted such appointment, shall

 neglect to perform the services required from him, shall forfeit the sum

 of $1,000. </p>



<p><a name="count"></a><strong>Counting electoral votes in congress</strong> </p>



<p><a name="15"></a>§ 15.  Congress shall be in session on the sixth 

day of January succeeding every meeting of the electors. The Senate and 

House of Representatives shall meet in the Hall of the House of Representatives

 at the hour of 1 o'clock in the afternoon on that day, and the President

 of the Senate shall be their presiding officer. Two tellers shall be previously

 appointed on the part of the Senate and two on the part of the House of

 Representatives, to whom shall be handed, as they are opened by the President 

of the Senate, all the certificates and papers purporting to be certificates 

of the electoral votes, which certificates and papers shall be opened, 

presented, and acted upon in the alphabetical order of the States, beginning 

with the letter A; and said tellers, having then read the same in the presence

 and hearing of the two Houses, shall make a list of the votes as they shall 

appear from the said certificates; and the votes having been ascertained

and counted according to the rules in this subchapter provided, the result 

of the same shall be delivered to the President of the Senate, who shall

 thereupon announce the state of the vote, which announcement shall be deemed

 a sufficient declaration of the persons, if any, elected President and 

Vice President of the United States, and, together with a list of the votes,

be entered on the Journals of the two Houses. Upon such reading of any

 such certificate or paper, the President of the Senate shall call for objections,

if any. Every objection shall be made in writing, and shall state clearly

 and concisely, and without argument, the ground thereof, and shall be signed

 by at least one Senator and one Member of the House of Representatives 

before the same shall be received. When all objections so made to any vote 

or paper from a State shall have been received and read, the Senate shall

 thereupon withdraw, and such objections shall be submitted to the Senate

 for its decision; and the Speaker of the House of Representatives shall, 

in like manner, submit such objections to the House of Representatives 

for its decision; and no electoral vote or votes from any State which shall 

have been regularly given by electors whose appointment has been lawfully

 certified to according to section 6 of this title from which but one return

has been received shall be rejected, but the two Houses concurrently may 

reject the vote or votes when they agree that such vote or votes have not 

been so regularly given by electors whose appointment has been so certified.

 If more than one return or paper purporting to be a return from a State 

shall have been received by the President of the Senate, those votes, and 

those only, shall be counted which shall have been regularly given by the

 electors who are shown by the determination mentioned in section 5 of this 

title to have been appointed, if the determination in said section provided

 for shall have been made, or by such successors or substitutes, in case 

of a vacancy in the board of electors so ascertained, as have been appointed

 to fill such vacancy in the mode provided by the laws of the State; but 

in case there shall arise the question which of two or more of such State 

authorities determining what electors have been appointed, as mentioned

 in section 5 of this title, is the lawful tribunal of such State, the votes 

regularly given of those electors, and those only, of such State shall 

be counted whose title as electors the two Houses, acting separately, shall 

concurrently decide is supported by the decision of such State so authorized

by its law; and in such case of more than one return or paper purporting

 to be a return from a State, if there shall have been no such determination 

of the question in the State aforesaid, then those votes, and those only, 

shall be counted which the two Houses shall concurrently decide were cast

 by lawful electors appointed in accordance with the laws of the State,

unless the two Houses, acting separately, shall concurrently decide such 

votes not to be the lawful votes of the legally appointed electors of such

 State. But if the two Houses shall disagree in respect of the counting

 of such votes, then, and in that case, the votes of the electors whose

 appointment shall have been certified by the executive of the State, under 

the seal thereof, shall be counted. When the two Houses have voted, they 

shall immediately again meet, and the presiding officer shall then announce 

the decision of the questions submitted. No votes or papers from any other 

State shall be acted upon until the objections previously made to the votes

or papers from any State shall have been finally disposed of. </p>



<p><strong>Same; seats for officers and members of two houses in joint 

meeting</strong> </p>



<p>§ 16. At such joint meeting of the two Houses seats shall be provided

 as follows: For the President of the Senate, the Speaker's chair; for the

 Speaker, immediately upon his left; the Senators, in the body of the Hall 

upon the right of the presiding officer; for the Representatives, in the 

body of the Hall not provided for the Senators; for the tellers, Secretary

 of the Senate, and Clerk of the House of Representatives, at the Clerk's

 desk; for the other officers of the two Houses, in front of the Clerk's 

desk and upon each side of the Speaker's platform. Such joint meeting shall

 not be dissolved until the count of electoral votes shall be completed 

and the result declared; and no recess shall be taken unless a question

shall have arisen in regard to counting any such votes, or otherwise under 

this subchapter, in which case it shall be competent for either House,

acting separately, in the manner herein before provided, to direct a recess

 of such House not beyond the next calendar day, Sunday excepted, at the 

hour of 10 o'clock in the forenoon. But if the counting of the electoral 

votes and the declaration of the result shall not have been completed before 

the fifth calendar day next after such first meeting of the two Houses,

 no further or other recess shall be taken by either House. </p>



<p><strong>Same; limit of debate in each house</strong> </p>



<p>§ 17. When the two Houses separate to decide upon an objection

 that may have been made to the counting of any electoral vote or votes 

from any State, or other question arising in the matter, each Senator and 

Representative may speak to such objection or question five minutes, and 

not more than once; but after such debate shall have lasted two hours it 

shall be the duty of the presiding officer of each House to put the main 

question without further debate. </p>



<p><strong>Same; parliamentary procedure at joint meeting</strong> </p>



<p>§ 18. While the two Houses shall be in meeting as provided in this 

chapter, the President of the Senate shall have power to preserve order; 

and no debate shall be allowed and no question shall be put by the presiding 

officer except to either House on a motion to withdraw. </p>

(2) if his discharge of the powers and duties of the office is founded 

in whole or in part on the inability of the President or Vice President,

 on the part of an individual higher on such list shall not terminate his 

service. <br />



(3) The taking of the oath of office by an individual specified in the

 list in paragraph (1) of this subsection shall be held to constitute his 

resignation from the office by virtue of the holding of which he qualifies 

to act as President. <br />



(e) Subsections (a), (b), and (d) of this section shall apply only to such 

officers as are eligible to the office of President under the Constitution.

office of President devolve upon them. <br />



(f) During the period that any individual acts as President under this

 section, his compensation shall be at the rate then provided by law in
