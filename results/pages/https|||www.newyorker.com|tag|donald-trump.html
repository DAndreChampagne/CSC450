A tinfoil-hat brigade of reactionaries immediately insisted that the cunning “Democrat Party” had run a “false flag” plot designed to boost its chances on Election Day. On Friday, near Fort Lauderdale, F.B.I. officials arrested a suspect named Cesar Altieri Sayoc, a man in his mid-fifties with an extensive criminal record. Officials also seized the suspect’s van, which was plastered with pro-Trump stickers, as well as one that read “CNN Sucks” and another that had a picture of Hillary Clinton in the crosshairs of a gun."],["p","Law enforcement will continue to investigate the incident in the days ahead. But what’s already clear is that it occurred at a moment of tragic division and conspiracy-mongering generated, foremost and daily, by the President of the United States. The right has no monopoly on insult and incivility—the online universe can be a sewer of spite—but there is no real equivalence: no modern President has adopted and weaponized such malevolent rhetoric as a lingua franca."],["p","Trump is a masterful demagogue of the entertainment age. His instruments are resentment, sarcasm, unbounded insult, casual mendacity, and the swaggering assertion of dominance. From his desk in the Oval Office, on Twitter, and at political rallies across the country, he spews poison into the atmosphere. Trump is an agent of climate change, an unceasing generator of toxic gas that raises the national temperature."],["p","No one suggests that he is a perpetrator, but pipe bombs as a tool of political intimidation do not arrive unexpectedly. They come after the President’s remarks on “birtherism,” Mexican “rapists,” and Charlottesville; after “enemy of the people” and “Lock Her Up!” They come after he has mocked the disabled and victims of sexual violence, after he has praised many of the world’s autocrats and diminished democratic allies. Violence, for him, is a source of titillation. Recently, Trump rallied Montana Republicans by extolling their incumbent congressman, Greg Gianforte—“He’s my guy”—not because Gianforte had devised a piece of legislation for the common good but because he had body-slammed a reporter to the ground. “This is actually exactly why my father won,” Eric Trump said recently on Fox News. He is “un-P.C.,” not a “perfectly scripted politician.”"],["p","To be unscripted implies a kind of joyful spontaneity, but Trump’s ramblings always come laced with a thread of malice. His outrages are not mistakes; they are deliberate and a matter of pride. (“I know words. I have the best words.”) Speaking in the Oval Office last week, he riffed weirdly, yet furiously, about the great “caravan” of migrants—potential terrorists!—surging ever closer toward the American frontier. “Over the course of the year, over the course of a number of years, they’ve intercepted many people from the Middle East, they’ve intercepted ",["em",{"class":"small"},"ISIS"],", they’ve intercepted all sorts of people, they’ve intercepted good ones and bad ones, they’ve intercepted wonderful people from the Middle East and they’ve intercepted bad ones. They’ve intercepted wonderful people from South America and from other parts further south.”"],["p","At a rally in Wisconsin, on Wednesday, the President reacted to the news of the multiple bombs with a barely perfunctory call for a “civil tone.” Of course, he didn’t mean it, not remotely. He made it plain that civility is for suckers, a joke. “By the way, do you see how nice I’m behaving tonight?” he said, with a smirk. “Have you ever seen this? We’re all behaving very well.” The next morning, in a characteristically brazen tweet, Trump amped up the toxicity. A bomb had been sent to a media outlet. The fault was the media’s. “A very big part of the Anger we see today in our society is caused by the purposely false and inaccurate reporting of the Mainstream Media that I refer to as Fake News,” he wrote. “Mainstream Media must clean up its act, ",["em",{"class":"small"},"FAST"],"!” At 3 ",["em",{"class":"small"},"A.M."]," on Friday, he tweeted his fury at CNN."],["p","When the leaders of the Republican Party first acquainted themselves with Trump’s rhetoric and character a few years ago, many of them were appalled. Ted Cruz, after hearing Trump insult his wife’s appearance and insinuate that his father bore some responsibility for the assassination of John F. Kennedy, called his rival a “pathological liar,” a “snivelling coward.” But, after Cruz became one more casualty of the 2016 Republican primaries, and reckoned that he could not hold his Senate seat while attacking Trump, he, like almost every other light of the “party of Lincoln,” capitulated. The G.O.P. is now Ted Cruz writ large, a political party that has debased itself in the image of its standard-bearer."],["p","The midterm elections are being held in an atmosphere of immense national stress. It could only be so when the singular actor in the drama is Donald Trump, who thrives on the idea that American life is a daily cliffhanger, in which the hero bravely sets out to deepen the divide between his supporters and everyone else, to dismantle international agreements and alliances, and to protect corporate interests over the interests of working people and the natural world. There are, unquestionably, countless local and regional issues being debated, but, above all, this election is a referendum on Trump, a contest between his base and those who feel that it is in the national interest to establish at least some brake—a new majority in the House of Representatives, a new crop of governors and state legislators—to slow his disintegration of American life and his despoilment of the national spirit. Two years ago, the prospect of a Trump Presidency represented an emergency. Tens of millions of voters found a reason to stay home. This year, the polls are tight. The stakes cannot be overstated. ♦"]]],"canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"sections":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine","children":[{"id":"592dfa44d5fda942c34a0b61","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"592dfa44d5fda942c34a0b61","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Comment","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"comment"},{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"},{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"}],"name":"Comment","parent":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"},"slug":"comment"}]}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"magazine","contributors":[{"name":"David Remnick","type":"author","title":"David Remnick has been editor of \u003cem&gt;The New Yorker\u003c/em&gt; since 1998 and a staff writer since 1992.

at the Tree of Life synagogue, in Pittsburgh, that morning. “This wicked act of mass murder is pure evil,” Trump said, “hard to believe and, frankly, something that is unimaginable.” A few hours earlier, he’d told reporters that “it’s a terrible, terrible thing what’s going on with hate in our country, frankly, and all over the world.” The world’s problems go back for years and years. “You could say, frankly, for many centuries,” Trump continued. But perhaps the violence could be helped: “If there were an armed guard inside the temple, they would have been able to stop them,” the President suggested. “Maybe there would have been nobody killed except for him, frankly.”"],["p","Trump uses the word “frankly” with the same precision and thoughtfulness as he uses all words. He is a child dumping out a box of crayons. One infers that the point of “frankly” is to place a vague emphasis. The word has authority, a stentorian, swishing, rhetorical quality—a variant of “believe me” (another favorite). Near the end of a series—pure evil, hard to believe, ",["em","and"]," unimaginable—the effect is of a showman readying to sweep open a curtain. When bemoaning the lack of an armed guard inside a place of worship, “frankly” appears to gesture toward a joke, an impish wink at the notion—both hilarious and sad!—that the only person getting murdered would have been the murderer himself, if Trump had had his way."],["p","And yet there is something thought-shattering about this particular word emanating from this particular President.

That Trump will deliver real talk, voice what the rest of us are thinking, be authentic, is the campaign promise that continues to shape his term, and, in his two appearances on Saturday, the President positioned himself as the rare hero who is willing to speak out against the unuttered and unutterable forces poisoning American society.

Then he claims that the effects of his own behavior are beyond comprehension, sealing the Orwellian routine with a trollish affirmation of genuineness: ",["em","frankly"],". This is a liar not simply lying, but drawing attention to his lies in order to redefine the nature of truth. (Before the Washington ",["em","Post"]," stopped counting in September, the paper found that the President had made ",["a",{"href":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/09/13/president-trump-has-made-more-than-false-or-misleading-claims/?utm_term=.d9f6b7e71c1f"},"more than five thousand"]," “false or misleading statements” to Americans.)"],["p","Before opening fire on the Tree of Life congregants, Bowers posted a message to Gab, a right-wing social network that, like other online forums for extremists, casts itself as an embattled bastion of free speech. “Trump is a globalist, not a nationalist,” Bowers complained on the site. “There is no #",["em",{"class":"small"},"MAGA"]," as long as there is a kike infestation.” The gunman’s accusation evoked a riff-cum-vocabulary lesson from Trump’s rally in Houston on Monday. “A globalist is a person that wants the globe to do well, frankly, not caring about our country so much,” the President explained, before asserting, “I’m a nationalist.” The “frankly” in this case—meant to expose the dirty truth about globalists, and to preface Trump’s oath of fealty to tribal politics—reads as far more honest than anything the President said on Saturday. He is frankest at his rallies and on Twitter. There is a difference, of course, between saying what you mean and saying what is true. Trump is not practicing frankness when he deplores hatred. He is being frank when he foments resentments that are phantasmal. For him, falsehoods carry the weight of facts, whereas reality is “truly unimaginable.”"]]],"canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"sections":[{"id":"5904126172dadf5d0a508800","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news","children":[{"id":"59f0d2a0d2beb9720f019591","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"59f0d2a0d2beb9720f019591","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"The Current","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"current"},{"id":"5904126172dadf5d0a508800","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news"},{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"}],"name":"The Current","parent":[{"id":"5904126172dadf5d0a508800","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"},"slug":"current"}]}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"web","contributors":[{"name":"Katy Waldman","type":"author","title":"Katy Waldman is a staff writer at \u003cem&gt;The New Yorker\u003c/em&gt;.","email":"","bio":["div",["p","Katy Waldman is a staff writer at ",["em","The New Yorker"],".

his book “",["a",{"href":"https://www.amazon.com/American-Mind-Interpretation-Thought-Character/dp/0300000464"},"The American Mind"],",” from 1950, which I took down from the bookshelf during the weekend, the historian Henry Steele Commager notes that “the American” of the late nineteenth century had “little time for tradition and authority,” because “he knew that his country had become great by flouting both.” Simultaneously, however, the American “thought his government and the Constitution the best in the world, credited them with a large measure of the success of his experiment, and would not tolerate any attack upon their integrity.” Although some of Commager’s language, such as the use of “he,” grates on the modern ear, the paradox that he identifies survives to this moment, and it is doing untold harm to this country. The horrible events of the past few days have confirmed that the United States, while it remains a great nation, is a country trapped by its past. Despite a rising tide of gun violence and political extremism, it has repeatedly failed to adapt its institutions and its laws—particularly those relating to guns and the online spread of hate speech—to an age of technology-enabled savagery. Now the very foundations of the political system that so many Americans take for granted seem to be under threat."],["p","Is that a bit alarmist? On the basis of what we know, Robert Bowers, the forty-six-year-old loner who carried out a massacre at a synagogue in Pittsburgh on Saturday, and Cesar Sayoc, Jr., the former male stripper from Florida who has been charged with sending mail bombs to opponents of President Donald Trump, are both alienated people who have lived small lives filled with resentments and failures. Nonetheless, the larger threat that their acts of terror represent shouldn’t be understated. When opposition politicians cannot open their mail without fear of being blown up, when people of religion cannot attend their houses of worship without fear of being shot to death, and when the President cannot forswear partisan attacks for more than a few hours after a deadly act of terror, then liberal democracy is malfunctioning in tragic fashion. As Americans, and particularly Jewish Americans, watched the news this weekend, they could be forgiven for believing that the horrors other countries have endured at other times were now upon them."],["p","Of course, a few isolated acts of political violence do not add up to a conflagration. But the pluralist American model badly needs shoring up, and some of the necessary measures are obvious ones. The United States needs new gun laws that make it impossible for anyone full of hate to accumulate a personal armory. It needs restraints on the propagation of hate speech that take account of the fearsome reach and power of the Internet. It needs changes to the electoral system that empower the will of the majority, while still affording protections for minorities. And the country needs a President who isn’t an arsonist."],["p","If some of these reforms involve making significant alterations to the system of government that the Founders created, which is still accorded the same level of veneration in some quarters that it was in Commager’s day, so be it. When James Madison proposed the Second Amendment, he wasn’t living in a world where isolated haters could convene online and convince themselves that they were engaged in an apocalyptic struggle much larger than the daily drudgery of their lives. (“I can't sit by and watch my people get slaughtered,” Bowers wrote in his final social-media post. “Screw your optics, I’m going in.”) The founders didn’t inhabit an environment where deadly weapons of war, such as rifles that can fire dozens of rounds a minute, are mass-produced for private use, and where bomb-making plans are freely available on the Internet. (According to news reports, Bowers owned more than twenty weapons, including the AR-15 rifle he used at the Tree of Life synagogue.)"],["p","And, of course, the Founders, who worried greatly about the vulnerability of democracy to populist demagogues, didn’t envision a President like Trump. Doubtless, the anger and hatred that motivated Sayoc, who reportedly lived in a white van outside a strip mall, was rooted in some personal humiliations or privations he suffered long ago. But he wore a ",["em",{"class":"small"},"MAGA"]," hat and directed his venom at individuals whom Trump had targeted in his speeches and Twitter posts. To deny that there is any link between the President’s rhetoric and such acts, as Vice-President Mike Pence did on Sunday, is to engage in Trump-level deception; to insist that there is no link between gun violence and gun laws, as the G.O.P. has done for decades, is to engage in the same deception."],["p","Commager pointed out that his naïve subjects had some grounds for believing they were the beneficiaries of divine provenance. “Nothing in all history had ever succeeded like America, and every American knew it,” Commager wrote. “Progress was not, to him, a philosophical idea but a commonplace of experience: he saw it daily in the transformation of wilderness into farmland; in the growth of villages into cities; in the steady rise of community and nation to wealth and power.”"],["p","The descendants of Commager’s Americans have no excuse for being complacent. While the United States remains an economic leader, it appears right now to be spiralling into a miasma of acrimony, post-truth thinking, and violence. The combination of ubiquitous connectivity, unregulated social media, lax gun laws, and rampant political demagoguery is presenting a challenge that our system of government hasn’t faced before. To be sure, the issue of whether the center will hold isn’t exclusive to the United States. Sunday’s election result in Brazil and the announcement by the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, on Monday, that she won’t run for office again both testified to the fact that liberal democracy is facing a global challenge. But the United States is a special case. At least until Trump entered the Oval Office, the country liked to view itself as a model for others to follow, and, indeed, it did play such a role, however imperfectly."],["p","Can the country summon the desire to aspire again and the internal will to fortify the values on which its aspirations were based? Next week’s midterm elections will provide a timely and crucial opportunity to answer in the affirmative. Let’s hope and pray that it isn’t spurned."]]],"canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"sections":[{"id":"5904126172dadf5d0a508800","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news","children":[{"id":"59ef6620c6604764e97c762c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"59ef6620c6604764e97c762c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Our Columnists","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"our-columnists"},{"id":"5904126172dadf5d0a508800","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news"},{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"}],"name":"Our Columnists","parent":[{"id":"5904126172dadf5d0a508800","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"},"slug":"our-columnists"}]}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"web","contributors":[{"name":"John Cassidy","type":"author","title":"John Cassidy has been a staff writer at \u003cem&gt;The New Yorker\u003c/em&gt; since 1995.

The horrible events of the past few days have confirmed that the United States, while it remains a great nation, is a country trapped by its past. Despite a rising tide of gun violence and political extremism, it has repeatedly failed to adapt its institutions and its laws—particularly those relating to guns and the online spread of hate speech—to an age of technology-enabled savagery. Now the very foundations of the political system that so many Americans take for granted seem to be under threat. \n\nIs that a bit alarmist? On the basis of what we know, Robert Bowers, the forty-six-year-old loner who carried out a massacre at a synagogue in Pittsburgh on Saturday, and Cesar Sayoc, Jr., the former male stripper from Florida who has been charged with sending mail bombs to opponents of President Donald Trump, are both alienated people who have lived small lives filled with resentments and failures. Nonetheless, the larger threat that their acts of terror represent shouldn’t be understated. When opposition politicians cannot open their mail without fear of being blown up, when people of religion cannot attend their houses of worship without fear of being shot to death, and when the President cannot forswear partisan attacks for more than a few hours after a deadly act of terror, then liberal democracy is malfunctioning in tragic fashion. As Americans, and particularly Jewish Americans, watched the news this weekend, they could be forgiven for believing that the horrors other countries have endured at other times were now upon them.\n\nOf course, a few isolated acts of political violence do not add up to a conflagration. But the pluralist American model badly needs shoring up, and some of the necessary measures are obvious ones. The United States needs new gun laws that make it impossible for anyone full of hate to accumulate a personal armory. It needs restraints on the propagation of hate speech that take account of the fearsome reach and power of the Internet. It needs changes to the electoral system that empower the will of the majority, while still affording protections for minorities. And the country needs a President who isn’t an arsonist.\n\nIf some of these reforms involve making significant alterations to the system of government that the Founders created, which is still accorded the same level of veneration in some quarters that it was in Commager’s day, so be it. When James Madison proposed the Second Amendment, he wasn’t living in a world where isolated haters could convene online and convince themselves that they were engaged in an apocalyptic struggle much larger than the daily drudgery of their lives. (“I can't sit by and watch my people get slaughtered,” Bowers wrote in his final social-media post. “Screw your optics, I’m going in.”) The founders didn’t inhabit an environment where deadly weapons of war, such as rifles that can fire dozens of rounds a minute, are mass-produced for private use, and where bomb-making plans are freely available on the Internet. (According to news reports, Bowers owned more than twenty weapons, including the AR-15 rifle he used at the Tree of Life synagogue.)\n\nAnd, of course, the Founders, who worried greatly about the vulnerability of democracy to populist demagogues, didn’t envision a President like Trump. Doubtless, the anger and hatred that motivated Sayoc, who reportedly lived in a white van outside a strip mall, was rooted in some personal humiliations or privations he suffered long ago. But he wore a *MAGA*{: .small} hat and directed his venom at individuals whom Trump had targeted in his speeches and Twitter posts. To deny that there is any link between the President’s rhetoric and such acts, as Vice-President Mike Pence did on Sunday, is to engage in Trump-level deception; to insist that there is no link between gun violence and gun laws, as the G.O.P. has done for decades, is to engage in the same deception.\n\nCommager pointed out that his naïve subjects had some grounds for believing they were the beneficiaries of divine provenance. “Nothing in all history had ever succeeded like America, and every American knew it,” Commager wrote. “Progress was not, to him, a philosophical idea but a commonplace of experience: he saw it daily in the transformation of wilderness into farmland; in the growth of villages into cities; in the steady rise of community and nation to wealth and power.”\n\nThe descendants of Commager’s Americans have no excuse for being complacent. While the United States remains an economic leader, it appears right now to be spiralling into a miasma of acrimony, post-truth thinking, and violence. The combination of ubiquitous connectivity, unregulated social media, lax gun laws, and rampant political demagoguery is presenting a challenge that our system of government hasn’t faced before. To be sure, the issue of whether the center will hold isn’t exclusive to the United States. Sunday’s election result in Brazil and the announcement by the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, on Monday, that she won’t run for office again both testified to the fact that liberal democracy is facing a global challenge. But the United States is a special case. At least until Trump entered the Oval Office, the country liked to view itself as a model for others to follow, and, indeed, it did play such a role, however imperfectly. \n\nCan the country summon the desire to aspire again and the internal will to fortify the values on which its aspirations were based? Next week’s midterm elections will provide a timely and crucial opportunity to answer in the affirmative. Let’s hope and pray that it isn’t spurned.","rubric":"","socialTitle":"American Democracy Is Malfunctioning in Tragic Fashion","socialDescription":"A few isolated acts of political violence do not add up to a conflagration, but the country’s pluralist model badly needs shoring up, and some of the necessary measures are obvious ones.","seoTitle":"American Democracy Is Malfunctioning in Tragic Fashion","seoDescription":"John Cassidy writes about the threat to American democracy; the massacre, by Robert Bowers, at a Pittsburgh synagogue; and Cesar Sayoc, Jr.,’s mail-bomb campaign against opponents of Donald Trump.","channel":"","subChannel":"","issueDate":"","ledeCaption":"","contentSource":"web","canonicalUrl":"","contentType":"","textMimeType":"","tags":["Anti-Semitism","Mass Shootings","Democracy","Donald Trump","Social Media"],"interactiveOverride":"","revisionAuthor":"Ian Crouch","meta":{"collectionName":"articles","modelName":"article","publishable":true,"identifiable":true,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":true,"hierarchical":false},"id":"5bd766f7f4dc8b77a815730f","revision":46,"createdAt":"2018-10-29T20:00:55.084Z","modifiedAt":"2018-10-30T13:00:58.220Z","revisionCreatedAt":"2018-10-30T13:00:58.220Z","_embedded":{"contributorsAuthor":[{"fields":{"name":"John Cassidy","title":"John Cassidy has been a staff writer at _The New Yorker_ since 1995.

were ever going to start using the prerogatives of his office to bring Americans together, this was surely the occasion.","body":"-=-=-=-\n\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, after the discovery of more suspected pipe bombs addressed to senior Democratic figures, [President Trump](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump) called on Americans to “come together and send one very clear, strong, unmistakable message that acts or threats of political violence of any kind have no place in the United States of America.” Trump the Conciliator’s appearance on the national stage was a fleeting one. On Thursday morning, he returned to form, [tweeting](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1055418269270716418), “A very big part of the Anger we see today in our society is caused by the purposely false and inaccurate reporting of the Mainstream Media that I refer to as Fake News. It has gotten so bad and hateful that it is beyond description. Mainstream Media must clean up its act, FAST!” \n\nEvidently, Trump and his aides were angry that some people in the media had had the temerity to point out the role that he has played in creating a political environment in which alarming incidents, such as the attempted pipe-bomb attacks, were increasingly likely. In a statement on Wednesday, Jeff Zucker, CNN’s president, [said](https://twitter.com/CNNPR/status/1055183653351972864) that Trump and his press secretary, [Sarah Huckabee Sanders](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/09/24/sarah-huckabee-sanders-trumps-battering-ram), “should understand their words matter. Thus far, they have shown no comprehension of that.” \n\nOn Thursday morning, speaking to Fox News, Sanders [responded](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/sarah-sanders-cnn-disgraceful-for-blaming-trump-after-bomb-scare) furiously to Zucker’s comments. She said that it was “absolutely disgraceful that one of the first public statements we heard from CNN yesterday was to put the blame and the responsibility of this despicable act on the President and on me personally, when the person who is responsible for this is the person who made and created and put these suspicious packages in the hands and in the arms of innocent American citizens.” \n\nPart of what Sanders said was obviously true: the person responsible for these acts of terror is the bomber, who will, hopefully, be apprehended soon. But the rest of the White House’s response—including Trump’s tweet and Sanders’s interview—amounted to a depressing reminder that, even in a national emergency, with new suspicious packages seemingly being discovered by the hour, the President is incapable of acting as a unifying force for more than a few moments. \n\nAt the point of laboring the obvious, Zucker, whose offices were evacuated on Wednesday after the discovery of a suspicious package addressed to John Brennan, the former head of the C.I.A., care of CNN, had stopped well short of saying that Trump was directly responsible for the sending of the pipe bombs. In fact, Zucker had merely restated what A.&amp;nbsp;G. Sulzberger, the publisher of the *Times*, [told](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/29/us/politics/trump-new-york-times-sulzberger.html) Trump face-to-face during a meeting at the White House this summer: that “his language was not just divisive but increasingly dangerous,” and that he needed to face up to this. \n\nWhoever turns out to have sent the pipe bombs, the message that Zucker and Sulzberger delivered was eminently justified. Trump’s record of incitement doesn’t merely include targeting all the recipients of the suspicious packages on his Twitter account, and routinely using loaded phrases like “fake news” and “the enemy of the people” to describe journalists. During the 2016 election campaign, he encouraged attendees at his rallies to beat up protesters. Last July, he tweeted a mocked-up wrestling video of him body-slamming a man with a CNN logo superimposed across his face. Just last week, he praised Greg Gianforte, a Republican congressman who assaulted a reporter, calling him “my guy.\"\n\nTrump’s defenders can and will claim that some of his incitements have been issued in a joking manner. That hardly matters. There is simply no precedent for a U.S. President using such inflammatory rhetoric, and launching such personalized attacks, on a nearly daily basis. And it isn’t just Democrats and members of the media who are pointing out that words can have consequences. \n\nOn Wednesday, David Gergen, the veteran Republican political commentator, who has worked for four different Presidents, [said](https://twitter.com/peterelkind/status/1055267198913142784) on CNN, “Donald Trump unleashed the dogs of hatred in this country from the day he declared he was running for President. And they’ve been snarling and barking at each other ever since. It’s just inevitable there are going to be acts of violence that grow out of that.” \n\nThe veteran Republican strategist Steve Schmidt, who worked on the Presidential campaigns of George W. Bush and John McCain, has become an ardent critic of Trump. On Wednesday, in a series of tweets commenting on the pipe-bomb attacks, he [described](https://twitter.com/SteveSchmidtSES/status/1055128900664221700) Trump as “the greatest demagogue in American history,” someone who “has celebrated violence over and over again.” Schmidt [went on](https://twitter.com/SteveSchmidtSES/status/1055128905210826752), writing that “no journalist or commentator should be intimidated from making this point. The stoking of hatred and sundering of the American people was always going to lead to terrible consequences. Chief amongst them would be the initiation of partisan or sectarian violence within our country.” \n\nIt is hardly surprising that Trump got upset when he saw such statements. But, if he wants to prove his critics wrong, all he has to do is to stop vilifying journalists or anybody else who criticizes him and stick to the sort of placatory language that someone wrote for him on Wednesday. Instead, on Friday morning, he tweeted, “Funny how lowly rated CNN, and others, can criticize me at will, even blaming me for the current spate of Bombs and ridiculously comparing this to September 11th and the Oklahoma City bombing, yet when I criticize them they go wild and scream, ‘it’s just not Presidential!’&amp;nbsp;” If he were ever going to start using the prerogatives of his office to bring Americans together rather than [tearing them asunder](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1055826295337172993), this was surely the occasion. But, there he was again, in the words of Greg Sargent, of the Washington [*Post*](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2018/10/25/trump-wants-us-to-be-at-war-with-one-another-his-latest-rage-tweets-confirm-it/?utm_term=.5dbe1ec60503), “blaming the media for an assassination attempt against it.” That’s who he is.","rubric":"","socialTitle":"Why Donald Trump Can’t Stop Attacking the Media Over the Pipe-Bomb Packages","socialDescription":"If the President were ever going to start using the prerogatives of his office to bring Americans together, this was surely the occasion.","seoTitle":"Why Donald Trump Can’t Stop Attacking the Media Over the Pipe-Bomb Packages","seoDescription":"John Cassidy writes about President Donald Trump’s decision to attack the media during the nationwide pipe-bomb scare.","channel":"","subChannel":"","issueDate":"","ledeCaption":"","contentSource":"web","canonicalUrl":"","contentType":"","textMimeType":"","tags":["Donald Trump","Bombs"],"interactiveOverride":"","revisionAuthor":"David Muto","meta":{"collectionName":"articles","modelName":"article","publishable":true,"identifiable":true,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":true,"hierarchical":false},"id":"5bd2fb7823ddfa4b39256bce","revision":25,"createdAt":"2018-10-26T11:33:12.873Z","modifiedAt":"2018-10-26T14:45:40.913Z","revisionCreatedAt":"2018-10-26T14:45:40.913Z","_embedded":{"contributorsAuthor":[{"fields":{"name":"John Cassidy","title":"John Cassidy has been a staff writer at _The New Yorker_ since 1995.

But she may be pushed out sooner.","body":"\n-=-=-=-\n\nGermany, Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Monday, as she took the stage at a press conference in Berlin, needs to write “[a new chapter](http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/angela-merkel-und-die-cdu-der-abschied-erster-teil-a-1235740.html)”; the one with her name on it is done, or almost so. She will not leave tomorrow, or even next year, if she has anything to do with it. Merkel will step down as the leader of her party, the Christian Democratic Union, in early December, at its next conference, in Hamburg. She would like to stay on as Chancellor until 2021, which is when she would have had to run for reëlection, though she may be pushed out sooner. In any event, she said, “This fourth term as Chancellor is my last.” (She added, “just for the record,” that she would not seek any other office, either.) Whether she can stay on depends, as much as anything, on whether anyone in her party, or in any German party, can really measure up to her and make a convincing leadership claim before then. She has served as the center for thirteen years. \n\nOn Sunday, the C.D.U. won just twenty-seven per cent of the vote in [elections](http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/hessen-landtagswahl-auf-nach-jamaika-kommentar-a-1235585.html) in the federal state of Hesse (which includes Frankfurt), a drop of eleven per cent since the state’s last election, in 2013. That followed similarly grim results for the C.D.U.’s sister party, the Christian Social Union (C.S.U.), in Bavarian state elections two weeks ago—thirty-seven per cent, down ten. What is especially unsettling is that the C.D.U. was, in both cases, still the biggest vote-getter, or rather the biggest remaining fragment in a riven political field. The Social Democratic Party, the traditional left-of-center party, has lost its way; it didn’t quite manage to get twenty per cent in Hesse (down ten per cent), ending up in a virtual tie with the Green Party (which was up by almost nine). Thankfully, both were a few points ahead of the far-right, anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (A.F.D.), but for how long? The A.F.D. got more than thirteen per cent of the vote, tripling its previous share, and will enter the regional legislature for the first time. \n\nWhat is even more alarming is that the German results are hardly an isolated phenomenon. Merkel made her announcement the day after [Jair Bolsonaro won the Presidency in Brazil](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/jair-bolsonaros-victory-echoes-donald-trumps-with-key-differences) and a day before President Donald Trump announced that [he thought he could end birthright citizenship](https://newyorker.com/news/current/trump-birthright-citizenship-and-the-politics-of-fear-and-rage) in the United States despite the clear words of the Constitution stating otherwise. From Viktor Orbán, in Hungary, to Rodrigo Duterte, in the Philippines, there is a clear theme emerging: love the big man, fear the stranger.     \n\nGermany doesn’t have such a figure yet—not this time around. (Nor does Britain, though it has Boris Johnson, [whose farce is getting uglier](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/theresa-may-and-boris-johnsons-bewildering-brexit-bash), and Brexit.) It has had Merkel, who urged Germans to believe, with regard to the large-scale arrival of refugees, that “we can handle it,” a position that her party has forced her to partially retreat from. Since last year’s parliamentary elections, she has held her position thanks only to an unstable “Grand Coalition” with the S.P.D.—the *Große Koalition*, known in shorthand as the GroKo—which might not hold together for long. She is burdened by the rise of extremism, by domestic discontent related to her welcoming of refugees, and by the weight of her long tenure—she has been in office longer than Franklin D. Roosevelt, the longest-serving American President, was at the time of his death. A person doesn’t hold power for that long in a competitive political system without having an instinct for it. That is particularly true of someone like Merkel, who came from a marginal part of the country—the former East Germany—and only entered politics after a career as a scientist, seizing the moment, after reunification, when so much was up for grabs. And Merkel’s instincts apparently told her that if she wanted to control her exit, she had to make her move now.\n\nIn a way, though, the American President whom Merkel recalled the most on Monday was Lyndon B. Johnson, who delivered a televised address to the nation on the night of March 31, 1968. For most of the speech, he spoke in earnest detail about his attempts to find some sort of way out of Vietnam. This included an announcement that the United States would pull back on—though not stop—bombing what was then North Vietnam. The surprise came at the end of the speech, when he said that he saw the task of peace as too important for him to “devote an hour or a day of my time to any personal partisan causes,” and added, “I shall not seek, and I will not accept, the nomination of my party for another term as your President.”     \n\nThe parallels are imperfect: Johnson was mired in an unjust war, and Merkel had tried to be true to a humanitarian ideal that was hard-won in Germany. But there is a sense that the fight over Europe’s identity has been for Merkel what Vietnam was for L.B.J., and the warning that his experience offers is that putting aside politics doesn’t necessarily give a President the chance to sit down and get things done. Politics is the job. Politics meant that Nixon, even during the campaign, with the prospect that he would be the person to talk to next, undermined Johnson’s efforts. Nixon won, the war went on, Watergate came next. \n\nWho can succeed Merkel? In terms of the Chancellorship, the question is complicated by the fragility of the GroKo; if it breaks up, there is a possibility of snap elections, scrambling all prospects. Within the C.D.U. itself—still, together with the C.S.U., the largest bloc—there is a short list of names: Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, known as A.K.K., who is the Party’s general secretary and a Merkel disciple; Jens Spahn, the Minister of Health, who is seen as a leader of those who regard Merkel as not conservative enough (he is also married to a man, a reminder that the American meanings of [terms like conservative are not universal](https://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/merkel-and-the-crying-girl-five-lessons));  Friedrich Merz, who lost a power struggle with Merkel more than a decade ago but recently reëntered the political realm (he spent much of the interval working for the investment firm BlackRock); Ursula von der Leyen, the Minister of Defense (also a Merkel ally); Armin Laschet, who is the head of the government of the state of North Rhine-Westphalia (which is kind of like being the governor of a combined state of Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois); and others. None of them is a completely obvious choice yet to lead the Party, let alone the country. (The same can be said of the other major parties.) For them, the next weeks and months will be a process of becoming a leader, not just being selected as one at a party conference. \n\nThat ought to also mean becoming a leader in the face of Germany’s emerging extremism. It means being the European leader who can, with others, such as Emmanuel Macron, clearly express what Europe means and what it stands for. And it means standing up to Trump, and to Vladimir Putin, who once, rather pathetically, [brought his dog to a meeting](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/12/01/quiet-german) to try to intimidate Merkel. At least Merkel, for the moment, is still fighting. But soon she will be gone.","rubric":"","socialTitle":"After Angela Merkel, Who Will Lead Germany—and Europe?","socialDescription":"Merkel, who announced that she is stepping down from her party’s leadership, would like to stay on as Chancellor until 2021, though she may be pushed out sooner.","seoTitle":"After Angela Merkel, Who Will Lead Germany—And Europe?","seoDescription":"Amy Davidson Sorkin writes on Angela Merkel’s announcement that she will step down as the leader of her party, the Christian Democratic Union, and what may be next for Germany.","channel":"","subChannel":"","issueDate":"","ledeCaption":"","contentSource":"web","canonicalUrl":"","contentType":"","textMimeType":"","tags":["Germany","Angela Merkel","Donald Trump"],"interactiveOverride":"","revisionAuthor":"Murat Oztaskin","meta":{"collectionName":"articles","modelName":"article","publishable":true,"identifiable":true,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":true,"hierarchical":false},"id":"5bd76586daf42d0501bd518d","revision":24,"createdAt":"2018-10-29T19:54:46.416Z","modifiedAt":"2018-10-30T17:49:33.888Z","revisionCreatedAt":"2018-10-30T17:49:33.888Z","_embedded":{"contributorsAuthor":[{"fields":{"name":"Amy Davidson Sorkin","title":"Amy Davidson Sorkin, a _New Yorker_ staff writer, is a regular contributor to Comment for the magazine and writes a Web [column](http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson), in which she covers war, sports, and everything in between.","email":"","socialMedia":[],"canonicalUrl":"http://www.newyorker.com/contributors/amy-davidson-sorkin","bio":"Amy Davidson Sorkin became a staff writer in 2014.

Others were sent to the former President Barack Obama; the former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton; the former Vice-President Joe Biden; the former Attorney General Eric Holder; Robert De Niro, the actor, who has been critical of Trump; and the former C.I.A. director John Brennan, care of CNN. (At the Houston rally, when Trump referred to the “fake-news media,” the crowd chanted, “CNN sucks!” He smiled in response.) An explosive had already been found in a mailbox at the New York state home of [George Soros](https://www.newyorker.com/news/current/the-bombs-addressed-to-obama-clinton-and-soros-and-the-history-of-soros-mongering). Most of the packages had a half-dozen first-class stamps on them and return labels with the office address and misspelled name of Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz; the one sent to Holder was misaddressed, and so was redirected to her. Wasserman Schultz is a Florida Democrat who, as the chair of the Democratic National Committee, was often the focus of Trump’s insults and insinuations during the 2016 Presidential campaign. \n\nThat rhetorical role is often filled now by, as Trump said in Houston, “Max-eeeeeeeene Waters.” He drew out the syllable long enough for members of the crowd to summon up an image of the congresswoman, who is African-American, and remind them of all the blanks they were supposed to fill in. Just in case, he prodded them. “You get that one? You get that—Max? She’s going to be in charge of your finances! Maxine—good old Maxine. Low-I.Q. individual! Low I.Q.”\n\nWaters could become the chair of the House Financial Services Committee if the Democrats take back the House. Chairing that committee, which oversees the Fed and bank regulators, isn’t the same as controlling “your finances,” but it would still allow Waters more authority, apparently, than Trump thinks she has any call to have. Trump told the crowd that a vote for Democrats was a vote to “surrender” Congress to her and to other Democrats he insulted. (There was a Pocahontas reference, to Elizabeth Warren, too.) And the warnings about how they would handle committees were the tame part. “You know how the caravan started?” Trump said, miming a person handing out cash. “Does everybody know what this means? Huh?” This was an apparent reference to a video that a Republican congressman, in what might best be described as an exercise in imaginative projection, claims depicts someone—perhaps an agent of Soros?—paying people to join a group of Guatemalan and Honduran migrants headed north through Mexico, which was widely circulated on social media. This claim is [not remotely](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/20/world/americas/migrant-caravan-video-trump.html) [substantiated](https://www.factcheck.org/2018/10/no-evidence-soros-is-funding-immigrant-caravan/), and Soros’s Open Society Foundation has denied it. But Trump was on the case. “I think the Democrats had something to do with it,” he said, raising an index finger in the air, like a latter-day Encyclopedia Brown. The caravan is, he said, “an assault on our country. That’s an *assault*.” \n\nNo one knows at this point who sent the devices, or why. (Nor is it clear yet how effective they would have been as bombs; press accounts suggest they were crudely constructed and technically flawed.) These are unsettled times, in which fears have taken hold in many quarters. As my colleague John Cassidy, [surveying the field](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/the-dangerously-thin-line-between-political-incitement-and-political-violence), notes, this has included a gun attack on congressional Republicans playing baseball; someone also sent ricin to Trump and to one of his in-laws. These tendencies and terrors of hidden forces are present widely in America and always have been. What is distinct about this moment is that the President himself is so eager to stoke them. Trump has a homing instinct for where caches of resentment and anxiety are stored, and how they can be exploited to persuade people that we are in the midst of a crisis that only he can fix—with the help of his vigilant supporters. The packages also had in common the fact that they were targeted at people whom the President and his allies have spoken of as extra-judicial actors, even criminals, masquerading as politicians and civil servants in their efforts to undermine the country. He has referred to Holder as the person who “protected” Obama and the Clintons; when he does so, he can sound almost jealous. Others on the list, like Soros and Waters, are people who, he has implied, have no business being involved in public life at all. \n\nIn confronting his enemies and theirs, Trump tells the crowds, the country is already on a military footing. Tough-minded *ICE*{: .small} agents were clearing out MS-13 “nests.” Suburban towns in Long Island, he told the crowd in Houston, have to be “liberated,” adding, “You see the people, they’re clapping from their windows. I’m telling you, it’s like a war, a war zone.” Our cities are beset by the sort of “animal” criminal whose acts are inextricable from “chain migration.” When he praised Senator Ted Cruz—the ostensible point of the rally was to support Cruz in his race against [Beto O’Rourke](https://www.newyorker.com/news/current/beto-orourke-and-ted-cruzs-fidgety-pinched-debate), and to give Cruz, who long ago traded dignity for demagoguery, a chance to abase himself in front of Trump—he said that Cruz had done a good job “staring down an angry left-wing mob in our recent Supreme Court battle victory.” He added, “If you want America to endure as a sovereign, independent nation, go out and vote Republican.” The mob has a well-ordered plan, apparently, to sell out our sovereignty. \n\nThere was another rally—this time in Wisconsin, to support Governor Scott Walker—on Wednesday, the day when the Time Warner Center, in New York, was evacuated because of [the package that had arrived at CNN’s offices](https://www.newyorker.com/news/current/what-it-was-like-in-the-cnn-newsroom-when-news-broke-of-a-bomb-in-the-building) there, with similar scenes at congressional offices, and news that the Secret Service had intercepted the packages sent to Obama and to Clinton. Trump began by promising an “aggressive” investigation, and condemned violence perpetrated in the name of politics. “Great country,” he said. “Going to get along.” As he spoke, he sounded both like someone reciting an obligatory disclaimer and strangely aggrieved, as though he were the true victim of the day’s events. When he said that “those engaged in the political arena must stop treating political opponents as morally defective,” he certainly didn’t seem to be reflecting on his portrayal of Waters. He added, “No one should carelessly compare political opponents to historical villains” or “mob people in public places.” Having worked in the word “mob,” his shorthand for Democrats and all they bring with them, he praised himself for “behaving.”\n\nHe also spoke, again, about how America is being “assaulted,” and how the Democrats are complicit in bringing “known gang members, predators, criminal aliens into our community.” And he said that the media, whose members had been threatened that same day, has “a responsibility to set a civil tone and to stop the endless hostility and constant negative and oftentimes false attacks and stories. Have to do it.” By that, apparently, Trump meant stories about Trump. The next morning, on Twitter, after complaining about a *Times* story on his security-precaution-defying cell-phone habits, he blamed the media even more emphatically: “A very big part of the Anger we see today in our society is caused by the purposely false and inaccurate reporting of the Mainstream Media that I refer to as Fake News. It has gotten so bad and hateful that it is beyond description. Mainstream Media must clean up its act, FAST!” That is, it must come around to his way of seeing things fast. And if it doesn’t, then what?

A white clerk tells him that he will first have to read aloud a paragraph from the Constitution. When he easily does so, the clerk says that he will also have to read and translate a section written in Spanish. Again he complies. The clerk then demands that he read sections in French, German, and Russian, all of which he happens to speak fluently. Finally, the clerk shows him a passage in Arabic. The professor looks at it and says, “My Arabic is rusty, but I believe this translates to ‘Negroes cannot vote in this county.’ ”\n\nOld jokes have lately been finding renewed salience. Literacy tests, poll taxes, and grandfather clauses, once the most common mechanisms for disadvantaging minority voters, have been consigned to the history books, but one need look no further than the governor’s race in Georgia to see their modern equivalents in action. The race between the Republican, Brian Kemp, Georgia’s secretary of state, and the Democrat, Stacey Abrams, the former minority leader of the state House of Representatives—who, if she wins, will be the first black female governor in the country—is a virtual tie. But Kemp has invoked the so-called exact-match law to suspend fifty-three thousand voter-registration applications, for infractions as minor as a hyphen missing from a surname. African-Americans make up thirty-two per cent of the state’s population, but they represent nearly seventy per cent of the suspended applications. Kemp’s move is particularly questionable given that Abrams’s electoral strategy hinges on mobilizing the six hundred thousand unregistered black voters who have long been seen as the holy grail of Democratic politics in the state.\n\nKemp’s acts are singled out for scrutiny in “One Person, No Vote,” a book about modern-day voter suppression, by the historian Carol Anderson. In 2012, after the Asian American Legal Advocacy Center, in Atlanta, discovered that many of its clients who were naturalized citizens were not on the voter rolls, despite having registered, the group raised the issue with Kemp’s office. “In a show of raw intimidation,” Anderson writes, “Kemp ordered an investigation questioning the methods that the organization had used to register new voters.” In 2014, Kemp investigated the New Georgia Project, a voter-registration initiative that Abrams had founded. In a similar vein, officials in Jefferson County last week ordered a group of African-American senior citizens off a bus taking them to an early-voting site, on the ground that the transportation, which had been organized by the nonpartisan group Black Voters Matter, was a “political activity.”\n\nThe events in Georgia are part of a broader political project. The xenophobia and the resentment that Donald Trump stirred up during the 2016 election are fundamentally concerns about the future of the American electorate. (His reported comment that too many people are immigrating from “shithole countries” in Africa and the Caribbean was paired with a lament that not enough are coming from Europe.) He has repeatedly stated that he lost the popular vote because non-citizens voted for Hillary Clinton. Last Thursday, at a rally in Montana, he suggested that Democrats were responsible for a caravan of migrants now heading north from Honduras, because they “figure everybody coming in is going to vote Democrat.” Kemp, likewise, claimed that Abrams wants to let undocumented people vote in Georgia. The suppression of minority votes is the homegrown corollary of this strategy—an attempt to place a white thumb on the demographic scale.\n\nAccording to the Brennan Center for Justice, ninety-nine bills designed to diminish voter access were introduced last year in thirty-one state legislatures. Many of the recent Republican-led efforts stem from the Supreme Court’s 2013 decision in Shelby v. Holder. In an opinion that eviscerated the Voting Rights Act of 1965, Chief Justice John Roberts wrote that discrimination still exists, but not sufficiently to warrant the “extraordinary” remediation measures that the act imposed on the states of the former Confederacy. That argument is roughly equivalent to saying that a decline in the prevalence of an infectious disease means that we should stop vaccinating against it. Within hours of the decision, Texas announced a strict new voter-I.D. law. Mississippi and Alabama shortly afterward began enforcing similar laws that previously had been barred.\n\nThe decision added a layer of severity to a voter-access crisis precipitated by state laws that prohibit six million Americans with past convictions from voting. In three Southern states—Florida, Tennessee, and Kentucky—this means that at least twenty per cent of eligible-age African-Americans cannot vote. Meanwhile, North Carolina enacted restrictions on early voting, a policy that particularly affects African-Americans, who are likely to be hourly-wage workers and cannot always get to the polls on Election Day. Last year, the Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal to reinstate a voter-I.D. law in North Carolina that a federal court had found targeted black voters “with almost surgical precision.” In effect, the question posed by Roberts’s ruling is how much discrimination there has to be before you can justify protecting voters.\n\nIronically, though, a number of the recent laws validate Roberts’s argument about the undue burden that the Voting Rights Act put on the South; complaints have been lodged in several states that fought for the Union, such as Ohio, Wisconsin, Indiana, and Iowa, which have passed strict voter-I.D. or roll-purge laws. Earlier this year, in Kansas, a federal judge struck down a law that required voters to provide proof of citizenship to register, championed by Kris Kobach, the secretary of state, who served as a vice-chair of Donald Trump’s short-lived voter-fraud commission and is now running for governor. In North Dakota, which didn’t become a state until twenty-four years after the Civil War, Native Americans must now provide an I.D. that shows a street address—even though many have only a P.O. box.\n\nThe midterm elections are in two weeks. The results will be read as a referendum primarily on Trump’s Presidency, but also on the effectiveness of the electoral restrictions. The old punch line has changed: a professor fluent in five languages no longer need travel south to encounter voter suppression. Voter access is not just a regional crisis; it is a national one. ♦","hed":"Not Every Vote Counts","issueDate":"October 29, 2018","tags":["Voting","Georgia","Brian Kemp","African-Americans","Voting Rights","Voter Suppression","category_news","\"One Person, One Vote\"","Carol Anderson","Asian American Legal Advocacy Center","New Georgia Project","Black Votes Matter","Shelby v.

gauche, reality-TV-worthy lark, [Donald Trump](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump)’s political career has trafficked—profitably—in spectacle. The risqué language of his rhetoric, the belligerent fervor of the campaign rallies that he holds even two years after the election, the malign charisma that he exudes—all this was in pursuit of a cynical principle that he has organized his life and, now, the nation’s politics around. Selfless service is no longer the most esteemed virtue of democracy; celebrity is. It’s for this reason that the image of a *MAGA*{: .small}-hatted Kanye West, seated, on Thursday, in front of the Resolute Desk and blacksplaining the evils of the Democratic Party, while Trump nodded along, felt less surreal than it should have. Rather, it seemed a logical turn of events in a cosmos capable of granting Donald Trump [three hundred and four votes](https://transition.fec.gov/pubrec/fe2016/federalelections2016.pdf#page=11) in the Electoral College. Surrealism only works when there is a stable reference for reality.\n\nAs part of a ten-minute logorrhea jaunt in the Oval Office, West oddly admitted that he saw Trump as a reference point for his own masculinity, and that he derived superpowers from his red Make America Great Again hat. To the extent that it matters—and, in the marketplace of spectacle, it does not matter much—West is not a conservative; he’s a contrarian. (The same can be said of Trump.) An actual commitment to conservatism would require more stringently analytical or, at least, consistent thinking than West has demonstrated since he started his *MAGA*{: .small} spree, earlier this year. It’s not uncommon for men unburdened by rigorous thinking but convinced of the superiority of their intellects to presume that a minority opinion is the most valid one. As they see it, a rarity among men must certainly hold the least common of world views. It is not uncommon for people to support Donald Trump, as the rallies that he presides over indicate. But it *is* uncommon for black men, eighty-two per cent of whom voted for Hillary Clinton, to support him. It is safe to assume that Trump’s support among middle-aged rappers is at least as meagre. This conflation of élitism with unpopular ideas is a trait that Trump and West share. Trump’s most absurd and wrongheaded ideas, from birtherism to trade protectionism, are connected by the fact that they were thought to be ridiculous by people whom he sees as his intellectual inferiors—not, like him, a genius. \n\nThe Trump Presidency is an animate example of what happens when the term “for argument’s sake” becomes an actual political ideology. Trump’s élitist contrarianism has been able to masquerade as conservatism, in part, because it exists explicitly in opposition to everything that the liberal Barack Obama stood for. Trump is not a Republican; he’s whatever is the opposite of a black Democrat who became President. This is why Trump was no doubt particularly gratified to hear West, a once favored son of Chicago, the city that gave Obama his political foundations, mouthing the right-wing talking point that violence in Chicago is a product of the Democratic Party’s failures. Homicide, West said, is a product of the Democratic welfare state, which destroyed black families. It’s worth pointing out that Trump has consistently drafted black celebrities—not elected officials, scholars, or policy analysts—into his discussions of African-American interests. (The N.F.L.-great-turned-activist Jim Brown accompanied West to the White House for what was supposed to have been a discussion of economic development, policing, and public policy.)\n\nThe discussion of Chicago, or, rather, the Chicago that is the fictive jungle of Trump’s pronouncements, illustrates precisely why it is dangerous to substitute impulse and connotation for thought and analysis. For Trump, Chicago exists as a central reference point for black failure. During the 2016 campaign, he politicized the [death of Nykea Aldridge](https://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/294239-wade-trumps-tweet-left-a-bad-taste-in-my-mouth), the cousin of the N.B.A. star Dwyane Wade, tweeting that her shooting, on the South Side of Chicago, was further evidence that black people would “vote Trump.” Shortly after taking office, Trump tweeted, “If Chicago doesn't fix the horrible ‘carnage’ going on,&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. I will send in the Feds!”—a threat that connoted less a concern about black lives than the partisan opportunities provided by conspicuous black deaths.\n\nAt the Oval Office meeting on Thursday, Trump advocated for the use of stop-and-frisk in Chicago (which, to his credit, West asked him to reconsider), despite the fact that the police department there has been plagued by complaints of excessive use of force, and that, less than a week earlier, the former C.P.D. officer Jason Van Dyke was [convicted of second-degree murder](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/laquanmcdonald/ct-jason-vandyke-laquan-mcdonald-timeline-htmlstory.html) in the shooting death of the seventeen-year-old Laquan McDonald. Trump’s own Attorney General has opposed the federal consent decree that was designed to address the problems in the department. For Trump, the violence in Chicago serves as the perpetual justification for these kinds of abuses. The belief that the violence is the product of a single political party is troublesome when expressed by reactionaries, but an outrageous one when expressed by a black Chicagoan who really ought to know better.\n\nThe roots of Chicago’s violence are complex and trans-partisan, but they exist in the context of a prolifically armed and exceedingly violent country. (White American violence alone would distinguish the United States from its less volatile Western industrial peers.) There is no way to segregate the six hundred and sixty-four murders that took place in Chicago last year from the more than seventeen thousand that occurred in the rest of the United States. The catalysts for violence in that city predate the “welfare state” and the rise of single-parent black households, in the nineteen-seventies. In the classic 1945 text “[Black Metropolis](https://www.amazon.com/Black-Metropolis-Study-Negro-Northern/dp/0226162346)*,*” the sociologists St. Clair Drake and Horace Cayton detailed the ways in which discrimination in housing and employment were negatively affecting black migrants. Twenty-three years before that, the Chicago Commission on Race Relations, formed after a race riot in which thirty-eight people died, found the violence to be a product of the exploding populations in the city’s Black Belt and the poor housing and employment conditions to which the growing number of African-Americans were subjected. (In 1903, W. E. B. Du Bois had lamented the ways in which overcrowding, filth, and discrimination, as well as unchecked vice, had spawned violence within the emerging black communities in Philadelphia.) \n\nTo understand Chicago, we could turn to Richard Wright, whose early work documented the travails of black migrants there. Or to the photographer Gordon Parks, who began his career depicting the living conditions of African-Americans in Chicago. Or to the artist Charles White, whose early work explored similar themes. Or to the poet Gwendolyn Brooks, whose work provided a window into the lives of black Chicagoans. Or to the playwright Lorraine Hansberry, whose “[A Raisin in the Sun](https://www.amazon.com/Raisin-Sun-Modern-Classics/dp/0413762408)” was partly inspired by her own family’s fight against racially restrictive housing covenants in the Chicago area. At one time, it would have been possible to turn to Kanye West for insight into such matters. \n\nBut you cannot turn to Donald Trump to understand Chicago, because you would then be trading presumptions instead of ideas, and putting empty placeholders where reflection and analysis belong—a known formula for idiocy. And if, by chance, one finds oneself, like Kanye, engaged in such clownery with the President of the United States, it should be recalled that idiocy is the one exception in life where it is always better to be useless than to be damned by one’s usefulness. ","rubric":"","socialTitle":"Kanye West, Donald Trump, and the Truth About Chicago","socialDescription":"The belief that the violence in Chicago is the product of a single political party is troublesome when expressed by reactionaries, but an outrageous one when expressed by a black Chicagoan who ought to know better.","seoTitle":"Kanye West, Donald Trump, and the Truth About Chicago","seoDescription":"Jelani Cobb writes about the rapper Kanye West’s visit to President Donald Trump in the White House and the perpetuation of the erroneous assumption that the city of Chicago owes its problem of violence to the creation by the Democratic Party of a welfare state in the city.","channel":"","subChannel":"","issueDate":"","ledeCaption":"","contentSource":"web","canonicalUrl":"","contentType":"","textMimeType":"","tags":["Donald Trump","Kanye West","Chicago","Violence","Racial Profiling"],"interactiveOverride":"","revisionAuthor":"Carlos Colomer","meta":{"collectionName":"articles","modelName":"article","publishable":true,"identifiable":true,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":true,"hierarchical":false},"id":"5bc2244dd942102d81c0f6db","revision":12,"createdAt":"2018-10-13T16:58:53.597Z","modifiedAt":"2018-10-13T23:57:40.080Z","revisionCreatedAt":"2018-10-13T23:57:40.080Z","_embedded":{"contributorsAuthor":[{"fields":{"name":"Jelani Cobb","title":"Jelani Cobb is a staff writer at *The New Yorker* and the author of “[The Substance of Hope: Barack Obama and the Paradox of Progress](https://www.amazon.com/dp/080271739X/?tag=thneyo0f-20).”","email":"","socialMedia":[{"network":"Twitter","handle":"jelani9"}],"canonicalUrl":"http://www.newyorker.com/contributors/jelani-cobb","bio":"Jelani Cobb has been contributing to _The New Yorker_ since 2012, and became a staff writer in 2015.

But a fuller copy of the e-mail correspondence between Ramirez’s legal team and Republican and Democratic Senate staffers shows that a Republican aide declined to proceed with telephone calls and instead repeatedly demanded that Ramirez produce additional evidence in written form. Only then could any conversation about her testimony proceed. The exchange culminated in a breakdown of communication between the two sides, as Republican and Democratic staffers traded accusations of stonewalling.\n\nThe e-mails show that Mike Davis, a senior Republican committee staffer, approached Ramirez’s attorneys on Sunday evening, shortly after *The New Yorker* published a piece about Senate Democrats investigating her [allegation of sexual misconduct by Kavanaugh during their college years](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/senate-democrats-investigate-a-new-allegation-of-sexual-misconduct-from-the-supreme-court-nominee-brett-kavanaughs-college-years-deborah-ramirez). Ramirez told *The New Yorker* that Kavanaugh had exposed himself at a drunken dormitory party, thrust his penis in her face, and caused her to touch it without her consent as she pushed him away. Kavanaugh has repeatedly said that the allegations are false. \n\nFrom the start, Ramirez’s legal team had called for the F.B.I. to conduct an investigation. Her attorney John Clune told Davis that Ramirez was seeking an F.B.I. investigation and said that, “on appropriate terms, she would also agree to be interviewed in person.” But when Clune proposed a phone call several times, Davis repeatedly insisted that Clune answer two questions: Did Ramirez possess evidence in addition to what was in the *New Yorker* article? And was she willing to provide testimony to the committee’s investigators?\n\nClune answered the Republican staffer’s questions, suggesting that Ramirez did, in fact, have additional witnesses and other evidence. And, he said, of Ramirez’s willingness to testify to the committee’s investigators, “We couldn’t answer without learning more from you about the details of whatever process you are contemplating. After hearing more, we would advise the client accordingly.” Davis then requested that Ramirez’s team provide evidence in the form of a letter, e-mail, or statement to the committee’s investigators before he would consider a call. Clune continued to try to schedule a call with a Democratic staffer on the e-mail thread, but Davis wrote back to him, saying that, “before we discuss a phone call or any other next steps, again, we need to have the following information,” and reiterated the two questions. \n\nAt that point, Heather Sawyer, the Democratic staffer who was copied on the e-mails in accordance with committee policy, wrote to Davis, “As you’re aware, Ms. Ramirez’s counsel have repeatedly requested to speak with the Committee, on a bipartisan basis, to determine how to proceed. You refused. I’ve never encountered an instance where the Committee has refused even to speak with an individual or counsel. I am perplexed as to why this is happening here, except that it seems designed to ensure that the Majority can falsely claim that Ms. Ramirez and her lawyers refused to cooperate. That simply is not true.”\n\nDavis responded, “I have not refused to speak with anyone. I am simply requesting – for the __7th time__ now __over the last 48 hours__ – that Ms. Ramirez’s attorneys provide the Senate Judiciary Committee with any __*evidence*{:.underline}__ that they have before we move to the next steps.” (Emphasis in original.) Finally, one of Ramirez’s lawyers sent a formal letter requesting an F.B.I. investigation. The letter said that Ramirez “is willing to cooperate with the Committee,” and that her efforts to do so were being rebuffed. \n\nSawyer did not respond to a request for comment. A Democratic staffer responding on her behalf confirmed that the e-mails were accurate. \n\nDavis did not comment, but he provided a separate personal e-mail sent to one of Ramirez’s attorneys, noting that they were acquaintances and saying, “I look forward to working with you on this matter.” In a statement, a Republican committee aide said, “Our staff proactively reached out to Ms. Ramirez’s attorney just minutes after she went public in the New Yorker, and we did so on a bipartisan basis. As a general practice, the committee requests to review any evidence or statement before determining how best to proceed with an investigation. This is necessary given the sheer volume of claims that the committee receives. Our staff asked on seven separate occasions over the course of 48 hours for any evidence or statement Ms. Ramirez would be willing to provide. Unfortunately, her counsels have not provided the committee with any such material to review.” The aide noted that the committee asked Kavanaugh about the allegation during an interview this week. \n\nRamirez’s attorney, Clune, disputed that description of the committee’s response, saying in a statement that he had responded “quickly and positively” to each of the committee’s inquiries. “Almost immediately in our correspondence, they became less interested in hearing from her and more interested in discovering what witnesses we could bring forward. Since it was only the majority staff that made these demands, as the minority staff questioned those demands as unprecedented, we became suspicious that any disclosures we might file would be shared inappropriately with Judge Kavanaugh or others to prepare and attack Debbie’s account,” Clune wrote. “Since Debbie’s interest was in an F.B.I. investigation where Judge Kavanaugh could be questioned under oath, we didn’t feel comfortable releasing this information without their assurances. We continued to attempt to negotiate in good faith by submitting a lengthier letter providing more information as well as Debbie’s request for investigation. Other than replying ‘received’ on Thursday morning, the committee has not responded. It is remarkable that the committee admits they had enough information to question Judge Kavanaugh under oath on Debbie’s statements in *The New Yorker*, yet that very same information was insufficient for Debbie’s counsel to earn even a phone call.” \n\nFord’s road to testifying was also marked by partisan rancor and allegations of stonewalling by both sides. In an e-mail last week, Ford’s attorney Debra Katz wrote to the committee’s majority staff, saying, “The imposition of aggressive and artificial deadlines regarding the date and conditions of any hearing has created tremendous and unwarranted anxiety and stress on Dr. Ford.” In announcing Ford’s agreement to testify after days of tense exchanges, Katz wrote that “many aspects” of the terms under which she would testify “are fundamentally inconsistent with the Committee’s promise of a fair, impartial investigation into her allegations, and we are disappointed with the leaks and the bullying that have tainted the process.” \n\nBefore Ford testified, Republicans on the Judiciary Committee announced that a vote on Kavanaugh would proceed on Friday. After yesterday’s hearing, Grassley told reporters that the committee would meet on Friday morning for the vote, as planned.\n\n\n\n----------\n\n\n*E-mails exchanged between Ramirez’s legal team and Republican and Democratic Senate staffers obtained by The New Yorker have been reproduced below.

true from the start: Charles and David Koch, who came to be known as “the Koch brothers,” were equals in bloodlines and in wealth, but Charles has always been the brains behind the brothers’ vast corporate and political operations. Those who know the brothers well predict that David’s retirement will have scant impact, particularly in the political realm, where the Kochs exert enormous influence.\n\nFor the past four decades they have tapped their vast fortune from a hundred-and-fifteen-billion-dollar-a-year family business, Koch Industries, to finance a private political machine whose reach and size have been described as rivalling that of the Republican Party. By lavishly underwriting candidates, policy organizations, and advocacy groups—often [through untraceable donations](https://www.newyorker.com/sections/news/can-time-inc-survive-the-kochs)—they have pulled American politics toward their own arch-conservative, pro-business, anti-tax, and anti-regulatory agenda, particularly in the environmental area. Although David Koch is also stepping down from his role as chairman of the Americans for Prosperity Foundation, the foundation wing of the Kochs’ main political-advocacy group, their influence isn’t likely to wane anytime soon.\n\nDavid Koch, who is seventy-eight and the wealthiest resident of Manhattan, is more socially prominent than his older brother. He is often chronicled on the social pages, having donated by his own estimate $1\\.2 billion to philanthropic causes, including many of New York City’s cultural, medical, and educational institutions, several of which bear his name. In contrast, Charles Koch, an eighty-two-year-old libertarian ideologue who continues to live in the brothers’ home town of Wichita, Kansas, has largely stayed outside of the limelight. But those familiar with the brothers suggest that although Charles is less well-known, he, not David, has long been the driving force behind both the phenomenal growth at Koch Industries and the duo’s ambitious political ventures.\n\nCharles also appears to have dominated David’s decision to retire. According to two well-informed individuals close to the family, David, who has been in declining health for several years, had resisted resigning, but Charles forced him out. A business associate who declined to be identified, in order not to jeopardize his ties to the family, told me, “Charles pushed David out. It was done with a wink, and a nod, and a nudge.” A second longtime family associate confirmed this, saying, “Charles had been pushing him out for quite some time. David kept resisting. It was bad. Charles took control.” \n\nThe decision became public on Tuesday, when Charles, who is the chairman and chief executive officer of Koch Industries, sent a letter to employees announcing that David would be retiring as vice-president, a development that he attributed to David’s deteriorating health. “We are deeply saddened by this, as we miss David’s insightful questions and his many contributions to Koch Industries,” Charles’s letter said. The letter didn’t disclose the nature of David’s health problems, but he was diagnosed with prostate cancer twenty-four years ago. Multiple associates say that in the past year or so he had visibly declined, losing weight and losing his train of thought in conversations, as well as occasionally nodding off in meetings and public events. “As a result,” the letter said, “he is unable to be involved in business and other organizational activities.” Charles Koch, meanwhile, continues to work through the weekends, often arriving at Koch Industries’ Wichita headquarters earlier than many other employees. “He’s a workaholic, like Warren Buffett. He lives to work,” the well-informed business associate told me. “It looks like he’s going to be doing this into his nineties.”\n\nIt is unclear, however, what will become of David’s ownership of nearly half of Koch Industries, the second-largest private company in the country, which began as oil refineries and pipelines, and has grown into a multinational conglomerate encompassing lumber, paper, chemicals, coal, fertilizer, and sophisticated financial-trading operations. Because the company is private, there is minimal transparency. But Charles and David Koch reportedly own virtually all of its stock, splitting the shares equally among themselves and plowing most of the profits back into the company. *Forbes* magazine estimates that each brother is worth approximately sixty billion dollars, tying them as America’s ninth-richest men. Steve Lombardo, Koch Industries’ chief of corporate communications, did not respond to questions about who would exercise control of David’s shares, should he prove unable to function. David has three children, the oldest of whom is college-aged. Charles has two children, including a son, Chase Koch, who has assumed a growing role in running the company.\n\nThe Kochs’ future prospects are of public interest because of the oversized influence they have exerted in American politics. Beginning in the late nineteen-seventies, the brothers became the primary underwriters of hard-line libertarianism in the country. From the start, though, Charles was the instigator behind their political activism while remaining largely behind the scenes. This dynamic was evident as far back as 1980, when Charles convinced his younger brother David to run for Vice-President on the Libertarian Party ticket. The brothers regarded Ronald Reagan, who was running for President that year, as too liberal. The Libertarian platform called for abolishing all federal income taxes and virtually every federal agency, including the I.R.S., the F.B.I., the C.I.A., the F.E.C., the E.P.A., the F.D.A., and the S.E.C. The party also opposed Medicaid, Medicare, Social Security, public education, and minimum-wage and child-labor laws. Charles and David, former  members of the John Birch Society, which their father, Fred, helped found, regarded centralized government as a scourge akin to Communism. At the time, however, such views were considered kooky even by most conservatives. The conservative stalwart William F. Buckley, Jr., called the Kochs’ views “Anarcho-Totalitarianism.” The voters’ verdict was equally harsh. David spent two million dollars of his own money on his candidacy in 1980, but he was trounced. The Libertarian Party earned only one per cent of the vote.\n\nAfterward, Charles told a reporter that he had grown disillusioned with conventional electoral politics but had not given up his quest to advance libertarianism. “Politics,” he told a reporter, “tends to be a nasty, corrupting business.” His interest, he said, is “in advancing libertarian ideas.” Instead of just funding candidates, Charles set out to subsidize an ideology. He aimed to change the way Americans thought by creating and funding an interlocking array of libertarian think tanks, advocacy groups, and academic, legal, and other organizations. Even two years before his brother’s Presidential run, Charles declared, “Our movement must destroy the prevalent statist paradigm.”\n\nNearly forty years later, many of the Kochs’ policy preferences are now standard Republican orthodoxy, having been promoted from the fringes into the mainstream by the dozens of nonprofit organizations and candidates they funded. Small government, anti-tax, anti-regulatory, and pro-privatization policies, as well as skepticism regarding global warming, are commonplace. \n\nAfter his 1980 bid for office, David Koch continued to be the more visible of the brothers. He spoke at Americans for Prosperity events and made head-turning political donations. But most of the planning for the Kochs’ political takeover was done by Charles Koch, various sources close to the process told me. It was Charles Koch, for instance, who came up with the idea, in 2003, of pooling political donations with like-minded wealthy conservatives, creating a huge, centrally controlled war chest for what is, in essence, a conservative millionaires’ movement. There are now some seven hundred members of this exclusive club, which meets twice a year at Charles’s invitation and calls itself the Seminar Network. Each member commits to donate a minimum of a hundred thousand dollars, and some donate millions. “David liked to rub shoulders with the other big donors, and to make large donations,” the well-informed business associate told me, “and so that part may now change. But Charles really runs the bus. Only when Charles goes will everything change.”\n\nThe election of Donald Trump, the single Republican Presidential candidate whom they had openly opposed, seemed to some to sideline the brothers. Charles had memorably described the choice between Trump and Hillary Clinton as like one between “cancer or a heart attack.” But while the Kochs didn’t get the candidate they wanted, under Trump they have nonetheless gotten many of the policies they wanted. Political allies, many of whom have have been subsidized by the Kochs in one way or another in the past, now fill numerous key Trump Cabinet and administrative posts.  \n\nAt the E.P.A. and the Interior Department, for instance, two government agencies that are vital to the profit levels of Koch Industries, top personnel have deep ties to the Kochs. The career of the E.P.A. administrator, Scott Pruitt, in Oklahoma politics was financially supported by the Kochs. Daniel Jorjani, now the acting solicitor in the Interior Department, formerly worked for Freedom Partners, the Kochs’ political-funding group, and at the Charles Koch Institute and Charles Koch Foundation. Dozens of other key Koch-affiliated personnel encircle Trump, including Marc Short, the congressional liaison in the Trump White House; Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who received backing from the Kochs  as a businessman and a congressman from Wichita; Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, who was a billionaire donor in the Kochs’ Seminar Network; and Vice-President Mike Pence, whose financial ties to the Kochs run so deep, the former Trump White House strategist Steve Bannon told me, that he worried that if Pence were ever elected “he’d be a President that the Kochs would own.”\n\nRecent news accounts have highlighted differences that the Kochs have had with Trump, including their plans to spend heavily against Trump’s imposition of tariffs on imports, and their opposition to Trump’s restrictive immigration policies. Some cite these fissures as evidence  that the Kochs are changing or moderating their views. Frank Baxter, a longtime donor to the Kochs’ political operation, told the [Washington *Post*](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/david-koch-steps-down-from-influential-conservative-network-he-helmed-with-his-brother/2018/06/05/aedeae68-68d6-11e8-bf8c-f9ed2e672adf_story.html) that the Koch network was “evolving.” But the Kochs have long favored free trade and minimal immigration barriers, both of which are consistent with their free-market beliefs, and also boost the profits of their multinational corporation. What has been evolving is merely their messaging, which casts their industry-friendly immigration and trade stances in terms of helping Dreamers and protecting low-income consumers.\n\nWhat is often overlooked, and is far more significant, is the large extent to which the Kochs’ policy preferences have prevailed under Trump. Trump’s only major legislative achievement, the tax bill, which reduced corporate taxes from thirty-five to twenty-one per cent, was passed with the support of a twenty-million-dollar campaign by Americans for Prosperity, the Kochs’ nationwide advocacy group. At the same time, the Kochs launched an equally effective political campaign to defeat the mechanism that Trump originally embraced to pay for these enormous tax cuts: a “border adjustment tax” devised by Republican Speaker of the House, Paul Ryan. Despite support from the White House and Republican leaders in Congress, the Koch network killed it. The final tax bill redistributed wealth from the bottom and the middle to the top and created gaping deficits that will likely require additional cuts in government spending, positions the Kochs have long embraced.\n\nTrump’s rollback of the Obama Administration’s environmental policies, crippling of Obamacare, and dismantling of key provisions in the Dodd-Frank financial-services law all have been top items on the Kochs’ wish list. There is no sign that David Koch’s departure from public life will significantly affect  any of this. The Kochs’ Seminar Network is promising to spend an estimated three to four hundred  million dollars  during the this fall’s midterm election. Evidently, even if there is only one Koch brother left at the table, the menu will remain exactly the same, and the tab will be larger than ever.","rubric":"","socialTitle":"One Koch Brother Forces the Other Out of the Family Business","socialDescription":"One less billionaire, but more political clout than ever.","seoTitle":"One Koch Brother Forces the Other Out of the Family Business","seoDescription":"Jane Mayer writes about David Koch’s retirement from Koch industries.

citizenship"]," in America, ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump"},"President Trump"]," has made the inconceivable possible. Most legal scholars appear to agree that the Fourteenth Amendment cannot be changed in the way that Trump proposes, but his vow has already elevated previously marginal arguments—they are now positions to be considered. If the President follows through with an executive order, what may have seemed like legal nonsense yesterday will have to be weighed by the courts. We have seen this mainstreaming of previously unimaginable ideas many times in the last two years: a ban on Muslims entering the country, the border wall, the withdrawal from the Paris climate accords, and more."],["p","The idea of revoking birthright citizenship is consistent with Trump’s newly vigorous embrace of the label “nationalist.” Most recently, at a ",["a",{"href":"https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/23/politics/donald-trump-nationalism/index.html"},"rally"]," in Houston and in an ",["a",{"href":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-rejects-blame-for-packages-sent-to-top-dems-says-suspect-was-insane-a-long-time"},"interview"]," with Fox News, Trump has defined “nationalist” as the opposite of “globalist.” The ",["em","Times"]," columnist David Brooks ",["a",{"href":"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/25/opinion/america-nationalism-diversity-trump.html"},"criticized"]," Trump’s use of the word by arguing that he loves America more than the President does; both men use the word “nationalist” as though it were synonymous with “patriot,” but this shift in usage is significant. “Nationalist” suggests a country under siege and carries the connotations of thinking of the United States as a nation-state that is ethnically, culturally, and religiously homogeneous. This, in turn, is consistent with the removal, in February, of the words “nation of immigrants” from the mission statement of United States Citizenship and Immigration Services. As with so many things, we haven’t talked nearly enough about how much these ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/how-the-mainstream-media-normalizes-trumps-anti-immigrant-rhetoric"},"shifts in official rhetoric"]," change the dominant political story."],["p","When Trump said, on “Axios on HBO,” that the U.S. is the only country in the world where people obtain citizenship by virtue of being born, he lied. But it is true that in some countries birth does not automatically entitle people to citizenship. In Germany, for example, a newborn is considered a citizen only if at least one of the baby’s parents is a legal resident who has been in the country for more than eight years. This law is a source of shame for many Germans, precisely because it is rooted in ideas of a nation’s ethnic and cultural purity. These kinds of laws create an ever-growing class of disenfranchised people who live in Germany legally and can participate in the economy but not in national politics—and this is precisely Trump’s objective, too: to shut Americans whom he perceives as other out of the political system. Two years after claiming, obsessively and falsely, that millions of “illegal immigrants” voted in the Presidential election, Trump is taking steps to make immigrant votes illegal."],["p","The pernicious effects of Trump’s statement do not end there. The only reasonable response to his attack on birthright citizenship is to defend it; the problem is it is indefensible. It may seem like a self-evident right, but it is based on a decidedly premodern premise. As the Northwestern University professor of political science Jacqueline Stevens has argued, in an online ",["a",{"href":"https://debates.economist.com/debate/immigration?state=opening#pro_statement"},"debate"]," organized by ",["em","The Economist"],", “Just as it would be unacceptable for a government to announce in advance that at birth one’s options to attend Oxford, earn $1m, or run for Mayor of London will be reserved only to those able to claim ancestors with these attributes, anyone claiming to embrace liberal values should find it equally unacceptable to use birth—either in a geographical territory or to specific parents—as the decision rule for restricting residence in a country.”"],["p","This may seem like a novel, even revolutionary, argument, but this is the conversation we ought to be having in the twenty-first century. Yet we are further from being able to have this conversation than we were even a week ago. This is the most dangerous and most consistent effect that Trump is having on American culture: he is bending the arc of history backward. He made many promises when he ran for President, but the promise to return to an imaginary past was his biggest. He is keeping it."]]],"canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"sections":[{"id":"5904126172dadf5d0a508800","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news","children":[{"id":"59ef6620c6604764e97c762c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"59ef6620c6604764e97c762c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Our Columnists","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"our-columnists"},{"id":"5904126172dadf5d0a508800","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news"},{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"}],"name":"Our Columnists","parent":[{"id":"5904126172dadf5d0a508800","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"},"slug":"our-columnists"}]}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"web","contributors":[{"name":"Masha Gessen","type":"author","title":"Masha Gessen, a staff writer, has written several books, including, most recently, “\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Future-History-Totalitarianism-Reclaimed-Russia/dp/159463453X/\"&gt;The Future Is History: How Totalitarianism Reclaimed Russia\u003c/a&gt;,” which won the National Book Award in 2017.","email":"","bio":["div",["p","Masha Gessen began contributing to ",["em","The New Yorker"]," in 2014, and became a staff writer in 2017.

early afternoon on Tuesday, ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump"},"Donald Trump"],"’s latest piece of political chicanery, Operation Midterms Diversion, could be considered a partial success. After a week in which the media narrative was focussed on pipe bombs, an alleged bomber who just happened to be an ardent supporter of Trump, and a racist massacre in a Pittsburgh synagogue, two of the three cable news channels—Fox and MSNBC—had reverted to subjects more to Trump’s liking: immigration, the southern border, and the allotment of U.S. citizenship."],["p","CNN, to its credit, was resisting the President’s effort to dictate the news agenda and stayed focussed on Pittsburgh, where the funerals of some of the victims of Saturday’s dreadful mass shooting were taking place, as the city was bracing for a visit from the President and his wife, Melania. The home pages of the New York ",["em","Times"]," and the Washington ",["em","Post"]," were both leading with the Pittsburgh story, too. But they were also featuring prominently Trump’s pledge, in an interview with the news site ",["a",{"href":"https://www.axios.com/trump-birthright-citizenship-executive-order-0cf4285a-16c6-48f2-a933-bd71fd72ea82.html"},"Axios"],", to abolish the right to U.S. citizenship for children born in the United States to parents who aren’t citizens."],["p","It was no accident at all that this announcement was made just a week before the midterm elections. “We’re the only country in the world where a person comes in and has a baby, and the baby is essentially a citizen of the United States for eighty-five years with all of those benefits,” Trump told reporters from Axios. “It’s ridiculous. It’s ridiculous. And it has to end.”"],["p","The first part of this statement was a Trump truth—that is, a blatant falsehood. Many other countries, including Canada, Brazil, Argentina, and Mexico, have birthright-citizenship laws. The second half of Trump’s quote was merely a restatement of ",["a",{"href":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/donald-trump-anchor-babies-arent-american-citizens/"},"something he said"]," to Fox News’s Bill O’Reilly in August, 2015, shortly after he launched his Presidential campaign, when he invoked the derogatory term “anchor babies” and added, “Our country is going to hell.”"],["p","The supposed news in the Axios story was that Trump also declared his intention to sign an executive order ending birthright citizenship, an option that most legal experts regard as a nonstarter because it would almost certainly violate the 14th Amendment, which states: “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States.” Even Paul Ryan, the Republican Speaker of the House, poured cold water on Trump’s idea of issuing an executive order. “You obviously cannot do that,” he ",["a",{"href":"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/30/us/politics/trump-birthright-citizenship.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage"},"told"]," a Kentucky radio station. “I’m a believer in following the plain text of the Constitution, and I think, in this case, the 14th Amendment is pretty clear, and that would involve a very, very lengthy constitutional process.” The floating of an executive order was a blatant election stunt on Trump’s part, the second in twenty-four hours. On Monday, he announced he was sending more than five thousand active-duty troops to the southernmost reaches of Arizona and California, supposedly to protect the border with Mexico from a so-called “invasion” by Central American migrants. “This is an invasion of our Country and our Military is waiting for you!” Trump ",["a",{"href":"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1056919064906469376"},"wrote"]," in a Monday morning tweet heralding the troop movements."],["p","Of course, there is no invasion, or even a threat of invasion. Despite an uptick in the last few months, the number of illegal border-crossings is only about a quarter of what it was back in 2000. (That’s largely because the number of Mexican migrants has fallen sharply in the past decade.) And the caravan of migrants and would-be refugees that formed in Honduras and recently traversed into southern Mexico is still a long way away: about a thousand miles from the U.S. border."],["p","If and when the caravan gets that far, there is every reason to believe that the U.S. Customs and Border Protection—a civilian agency with sixty thousand employees and almost a century of experience—will be able to deal with the challenge of intercepting and processing its members.

Seventh District is not, geographically speaking, part of Middle America, but it is in Virginia’s own heartland—a strip running through the center of the state, east of Charlottesville, at the top, and west of Richmond, at the bottom. The politics of its middle-class suburbs resemble those of suburbs throughout the country. Twenty years ago, or even ten, that might have made the Seventh Republican territory. While the district went for Trump by about six points, in 2016, that is no longer the case. Abigail Spanberger, a Democrat and former C.I.A. officer, is tied in the polls with the incumbent, Dave Brat, a former Randolph-Macon College economics professor who, in 2014, beat the House Majority Leader Eric Cantor in one of the Tea Party’s last high-profile primary wins."],["p","Now, though, when faced with the national Republican Party, suburbanites across the country are balking. An NPR/Marist poll found, in September, that fifty-three per cent of suburban voters nationwide “strongly disapprove” of President Trump’s performance and that sixty-one per cent preferred Democratic ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/midterms-2018"},"midterm"]," candidates to Republicans. Trump is only part of the story. Republicans have failed to win a majority of the suburban vote in three straight elections—a collapse in support that has already upended politics in Virginia. At this point, the state is reliably blue in statewide races. Many expected last year’s election to replace Governor Terry McAuliffe to be close, but the Democratic candidate, Ralph Northam, beat the Republican, Ed Gillespie, by nearly nine points. In this year’s Senate race, a September poll showed the Democratic incumbent, Tim Kaine, leading his far-right challenger, Corey Stewart, by sixteen points."],["p","Change has been slower at the House-district level, and Spanberger seems to know it, putting her national-security credentials front and center in her campaign literature.

Trump was just willing to say things in a more extreme way than everybody else. “I don’t mean to be disrespectful,” Trump said during a speech in Dallas that month. “But when a man has a problem, and he’s got his wife or his girlfriend, and they move her over the border for one day, has the baby on the other side of the border—",["em","our"]," side—now that baby is a citizen of our country for however long the baby lives.” He added, “It’s wrong.

",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/midterms-2018"},"running for Congress"]," in Virginia’s Seventh District. The Democratic challenger, a thirty-nine-year-old former C.I.A. official named Abigail Spanberger, is an upbeat, steely woman whose approach to the debate suggested a high degree of faith in the fact-packed three-minute briefing. The Republican incumbent, Dave Brat, is fifty-four and has been an economics professor for most of his adult life. He came to prominence in 2014, as an icon of the Tea Party, when he defeated Eric Cantor, who was then the Majority Leader for the Republicans, in the primary, despite being outspent by millions of dollars. In the debate this year, however, Brat looked like an ordinary Republican, while Spanberger expressed the vitality of the female-led resistance—the first political movement since the Tea Party to rival its energy."],["p","The district usually votes Republican, and so the dynamic that developed in the debate was a bit of a surprise: Spanberger gave compact accounts of her biography, her devotion to public service, and her belief in the optimism of the American spirit, while Brat—who has been personally endorsed by the President and is a member of the party that controls all three branches of government—opened by attacking her. Some of these attacks were absurd. Brat said that Spanberger had endorsed open borders, which isn’t true and would be surprising, considering that she used to work on counternarcotics strategy. Although he is a member of the House Freedom Caucus, and voted many times to repeal the Affordable Care Act, Brat insisted that he, and not Spanberger, would protect coverage for people with preëxisting conditions."],["p","Brat also ignored both the movement he’s a part of and the one Spanberger represents, arguing against her as a simple partisan, R. versus D. He mentioned Nancy Pelosi’s name twenty-five times; the audience began audibly groaning. Spanberger was fed up, too, and gave a stem-winder of a closing argument. “I am not the Democrat who supported single payer in the primary, I am not Nancy Pelosi, and I am not President Barack Obama,” she said. She then gave the speech the punctuation mark that made it go viral within hours: “Abigail Spanberger is my name.” Brat may still win the race—the Cook Political Report considers the district a toss-up—but Spanberger won the microphone."]],["inline-embed",{"type":"section","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22section%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cp%3EThe%20Tea%20Party%2C%20at%20its%20most%20energetic%2C%20had%20a%20distinct%20style.%20It%20was%20paranoid%2C%20but%20it%20was%20also%20pedantic.%20Great%20emphasis%20was%20placed%20on%20the%20full%20reading%20of%20legislative%20texts.%20Hundreds%20of%20groups%2C%20spread%20across%20the%20country%2C%20held%20committee%20and%20subcommittee%20meetings.%20Whenever%20I%20went%20to%20a%20campaign%20rally%20or%20town%20hall%20during%20the%20Obama%20years%2C%20the%20scene%20was%20dominated%20by%20conservatives%20with%20pocket%20Constitutions.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22callout%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522callout%2522%252C%2522name%2522%253A%2522inset-right%2522%252C%2522body%2522%253A%2522%253Cinline-embed%2520type%253D%255C%2522externallink%255C%2522%2520meta%253D%255C%2522%25257B%252522type%252522%25253A%252522externallink%252522%25252C%252522url%252522%25253A%252522%25252Fexternallinks%25252F5b5e119292497e4fd00180ea%252522%25252C%252522width%252522%25253A%252522%252522%25252C%252522height%252522%25253A%252522%252522%25252C%252522caption%252522%25253A%252522%252522%25257D%255C%2522%2520ref%253D%255C%25225b5e119292497e4fd00180ea%255C%2522%253E%253C%252Finline-embed%253E%2522%252C%2522attrs%2522%253A%257B%257D%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%22%5C%22%3E%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22externallink%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522externallink%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%2522%252Fexternallinks%252F5b5e119292497e4fd00180ea%2522%252C%2522width%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522height%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522caption%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%225b5e119292497e4fd00180ea%5C%22%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%3Cp%3EWhile%20I%20was%20thinking%20about%20Dave%20Brat%2C%20I%20returned%20to%20a%20book%20called%20%E2%80%9C%3Ca%20href%3D%5C%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FTea-Party-Remaking-Republican-Conservatism%2Fdp%2F0190633662%5C%22%3EThe%20Tea%20Party%20and%20the%20Remaking%20of%20Republican%20Conservatism%3C%2Fa%3E%2C%E2%80%9D%20written%20by%20the%20Harvard%20political%20scientist%20Theda%20Skocpol%20and%20her%20colleague%20Vanessa%20Williamson%20(who%20is%20now%20at%20Brookings)%2C%20during%20Obama%E2%80%99s%20first%20term%2C%20at%20the%20height%20of%20the%20movement%E2%80%99s%20influence.%20In%20retrospect%2C%20its%20continuity%20with%20Trumpism%20leaps%20off%20the%20page.%20%E2%80%9CThe%20generational%20perspective%20of%20most%20Tea%20Partiers%20is%20unmistakeable%2C%E2%80%9D%20Skocpol%20and%20Williamson%20write.%20Many%20people%20in%20the%20movement%20were%20over%20fifty%2C%20and%20fixed%20in%20their%20certainty%20that%20immigrants%20and%20young%20people%20are%20scamming%20benefits%20from%20the%20welfare%20state%2C%20their%20entwinement%20with%20an%20earlier%20generation%20of%20conservative%20media%20misinformation%2C%20and%20the%20intensity%20of%20their%20dyspepsia.%20Tea%20Partiers%20were%20even%20more%20likely%20than%20other%20conservatives%20to%20attribute%20the%20struggles%20of%20members%20of%20racial%20minorities%20to%20%E2%80%9Ctheir%20own%20personal%20failings%2C%E2%80%9D%20but%2C%20the%20authors%20point%20out%2C%20they%20were%20also%20more%20likely%20to%20believe%20the%20same%20of%20whites.%20%E2%80%9CTea%20Partiers%2C%E2%80%9D%20they%20conclude%2C%20%E2%80%9Chave%20negative%20views%20about%20all%20of%20their%20fellow%20citizens.%E2%80%9D%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EThe%20Tea%20Party%20was%20branded%20as%20a%20libertarian%20movement%2C%20and%20as%20an%20uprising%20of%20the%20politically%20unaligned%2C%20but%20Skocpol%20and%20Williamson%20see%20its%20deep%20roots%20in%20earlier%20conservative%20movements.%20They%20find%20that%20%E2%80%9Ca%20surprising%20number%20of%20people%20we%20met%20dated%20their%20first%20political%20involvement%20to%20the%20Goldwater%20campaign%2C%E2%80%9D%20and%20hear%20echoes%20of%20other%20conservative%20traditions%2C%20most%20of%20all%20evangelicalism.%20When%20a%20representative%20of%20Americans%20for%20Prosperity%2C%20the%20Koch%20brothers%E2%80%99%20libertarian%20group%2C%20speaks%20to%20local%20Tea%20Party%20groups%2C%20he%20takes%20pains%2C%20the%20authors%20notice%2C%20to%20sprinkle%20his%20account%20with%20testaments%20to%20his%20personal%20religious%20faith.%20By%20the%20end%20of%20Skocpol%20and%20Williamson%E2%80%99s%20account%2C%20it%20is%20less%20surprising%20that%20the%20movement%20eventually%20made%20its%20way%20to%20Trumpism%20than%20that%20it%20lingered%20in%20libertarianism%20at%20all.%20This%20is%20part%20of%20what%20Trump%20understood%3A%20the%20rage%20of%20the%20conservative%20grassroots%20was%20not%20primarily%20about%20the%20government%3B%20it%20was%20about%20the%20country.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%22%7D","ref":""},["p","The

In retrospect, its continuity with Trumpism leaps off the page. “The generational perspective of most Tea Partiers is unmistakeable,” Skocpol and Williamson write. Many people in the movement were over fifty, and fixed in their certainty that immigrants and young people are scamming benefits from the welfare state, their entwinement with an earlier generation of conservative media misinformation, and the intensity of their dyspepsia. Tea Partiers were even more likely than other conservatives to attribute the struggles of members of racial minorities to “their own personal failings,” but, the authors point out, they were also more likely to believe the same of whites. “Tea Partiers,” they conclude, “have negative views about all of their fellow citizens.”"],["p","The Tea Party was branded as a libertarian movement, and as an uprising of the politically unaligned, but Skocpol and Williamson see its deep roots in earlier conservative movements. They find that “a surprising number of people we met dated their first political involvement to the Goldwater campaign,” and hear echoes of other conservative traditions, most of all evangelicalism. When a representative of Americans for Prosperity, the Koch brothers’ libertarian group, speaks to local Tea Party groups, he takes pains, the authors notice, to sprinkle his account with testaments to his personal religious faith. By the end of Skocpol and Williamson’s account, it is less surprising that the movement eventually made its way to Trumpism than that it lingered in libertarianism at all. This is part of what Trump understood: the rage of the conservative grassroots was not primarily about the government; it was about the country."]],["inline-embed",{"type":"section","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22section%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cp%3EA%20few%20months%20ago%2C%20just%20after%20Paul%20Ryan%20announced%20that%20he%20would%20leave%20Congress%2C%20I%20spoke%20with%20a%20woman%20named%20Nancy%20Milholland%2C%20who%20co-founded%20the%20Tea%20Party%20in%20Racine%20County%2C%20%3Ca%20href%3D%5C%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fnews%2Fnews-desk%2Fwill-the-tea-party-era-end-where-it-startedin-wisconsin%5C%22%3EWisconsin%3C%2Fa%3E%2C%20and%20had%20been%20a%20grassroots%20ally%20of%20Ryan%E2%80%99s%2C%20even%20as%20she%20found%20much%20of%20the%20Tea%20Party%20movement%20to%20be%20too%20radical.%20What%20was%20remarkable%20about%20Milholland%E2%80%99s%20account%20of%20her%20participation%20in%20the%20Tea%20Party%20was%20just%20how%20active%20she%20was%3A%20she%20helped%20to%20organize%20countless%20demonstrations%2C%20arranged%20speeches%20by%20up-and-coming%20politicians%20and%20by%20Ryan%2C%20and%20had%20a%20role%20in%20sending%20advice%20up%20to%20the%20political%20ladder%20about%20what%20the%20grassroots%20actually%20wanted.%20Politics%20had%20become%20a%20way%20of%20life.%20When%20I%20asked%20Milholland%20what%20she%20and%20others%20had%20expected%20from%20the%20movement%2C%20she%20gave%20a%20very%20mainstream%2C%20one-word%20answer%3A%20%E2%80%9CReform.%E2%80%9D%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22callout%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522callout%2522%252C%2522name%2522%253A%2522inset-right%2522%252C%2522body%2522%253A%2522%253Cinline-embed%2520type%253D%255C%2522externallink%255C%2522%2520meta%253D%255C%2522%25257B%252522type%252522%25253A%252522externallink%252522%25252C%252522url%252522%25253A%252522%25252Fexternallinks%25252F5aa17d7578446d33a0636ebe%252522%25252C%252522width%252522%25253A%252522%252522%25252C%252522height%252522%25253A%252522%252522%25252C%252522caption%252522%25253A%252522%252522%25257D%255C%2522%2520ref%253D%255C%25225aa17d7578446d33a0636ebe%255C%2522%253E%253C%252Finline-embed%253E%2522%252C%2522attrs%2522%253A%257B%257D%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%22%5C%22%3E%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22externallink%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522externallink%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%2522%252Fexternallinks%252F5aa17d7578446d33a0636ebe%2522%252C%2522width%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522height%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522caption%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%225aa17d7578446d33a0636ebe%5C%22%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%3Cp%3EDid%20they%20get%20what%20they%20wanted%3F%20If%20the%20measure%20is%20how%20much%20power%20conservatives%20accrued%2C%20then%20probably%20so.%20The%20wave%20of%20teachers%20strikes%20across%20the%20country%20was%20one%20sign%20of%20how%20successful%20conservatives%20have%20been%20at%20stripping%20down%20government%3B%20the%20Republican%20dominance%20of%20the%20political%20system%20at%20every%20level%20is%20another.%20But%20the%20past%20year%20has%20helped%20prove%20how%20unable%20the%20Tea%20Party%20was%20to%20persuade%20the%20wider%20public.%20Its%20battle%20cry%2C%20to%20repeal%20Obamacare%2C%20has%20mostly%20failed%2C%20and%20in%20campaigns%20this%20year%20ideologues%20such%20as%20Brat%20and%20Governor%20Scott%20Walker%2C%20of%20Wisconsin%2C%20have%20argued%20that%20they%20had%20defended%20coverage%20for%20pre%C3%ABxisting%20conditions%20all%20along.%20This%20is%20a%20lie%2C%20of%20course%2C%20and%20it%20is%20also%20a%20measure%20of%20the%20movement%E2%80%99s%20failure.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EMeanwhile%2C%20the%20average%20Democratic%20candidate%20for%20the%20House%20of%20Representatives%20has%20raised%20roughly%20seven%20times%20as%20much%20money%20as%20the%20average%20Republican%2C%20and%20conservative%20legislators%20have%20largely%20stopped%20holding%20town-hall%20meetings%2C%20because%20they%20are%20so%20often%20overrun%20by%20liberal%20activists.%20Skocpol%20and%20Williamson%20recount%20in%20their%20book%20that%20many%20people%20said%20they%20joined%20the%20Tea%20Party%20because%20they%20were%20sick%20of%20yelling%20at%20their%20television%20screens.%20Now%20it%20is%20liberals%20who%20are%20out%20in%20the%20streets%2C%20and%20conservatives%20who%20are%20home%20with%20Sean%20Hannity%20again.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EThe%20chasm%20in%20energy%20between%20the%20left%20and%20the%20right%20was%20on%20display%20in%20the%20debate%20between%20Spanberger%20and%20Brat.%20She%20spoke%20fast%2C%20pressured%20by%20the%20need%20to%20concisely%20introduce%20herself%2C%20lay%20out%20her%20ideas%2C%20and%20account%20for%20the%20movement%20behind%20her.%20There%20isn%E2%80%99t%20much%20about%20the%20resistance%20that%20parallels%20the%20Tea%20Party%2C%20but%20Spanberger%20might%20have%20noticed%2C%20looking%20across%20the%20debate%20stage%2C%20how%20quickly%20the%20Tea%20Party%20collapsed.%20Four%20years%20ago%2C%20Brat%20was%20an%20outsider%20with%20a%20movement%20at%20his%20back%2C%20and%20Paul%20Ryan%20represented%20the%20obvious%20future%20of%20the%

If the measure is how much power conservatives accrued, then probably so. The wave of teachers strikes across the country was one sign of how successful conservatives have been at stripping down government; the Republican dominance of the political system at every level is another. But the past year has helped prove how unable the Tea Party was to persuade the wider public. Its battle cry, to repeal Obamacare, has mostly failed, and in campaigns this year ideologues such as Brat and Governor Scott Walker, of Wisconsin, have argued that they had defended coverage for preëxisting conditions all along. This is a lie, of course, and it is also a measure of the movement’s failure."],["p","Meanwhile, the average Democratic candidate for the House of Representatives has raised roughly seven times as much money as the average Republican, and conservative legislators have largely stopped holding town-hall meetings, because they are so often overrun by liberal activists.

Now it is liberals who are out in the streets, and conservatives who are home with Sean Hannity again."],["p","The chasm in energy between the left and the right was on display in the debate between Spanberger and Brat. She spoke fast, pressured by the need to concisely introduce herself, lay out her ideas, and account for the movement behind her. There isn’t much about the resistance that parallels the Tea Party, but Spanberger might have noticed, looking across the debate stage, how quickly the Tea Party collapsed. Four years ago, Brat was an outsider with a movement at his back, and Paul Ryan represented the obvious future of the Republican Party. Democrats have been taking comfort in the demographic transformations taking place in the country, confident that the future is on their side. But political energy of the kind that liberals have right now evaporates quickly.

speaker on the roof of her house. “If fresh fish arrives at the market, I make an announcement,” she told me. “If baked bread is ready, or some ",["em","chicharrones"],", or if someone’s just died and there’s a burial ceremony, I tell everyone so they know what’s going on.” González Luna is genial, although hard of hearing, with dark hair and hooded eyes. When we met, she was wearing a bright green dress. Her price is twenty pesos per announcement, and a stack of mostly handwritten notices to be read throughout the day sat in a neat pile on her desk. One of them, typed on letterhead, stood out: it was a message from the local government about the caravan of Central American migrants who were due to arrive the next day. “Do not let small children wander through the streets while the caravan is here,” it began. “Do not open stores or businesses in the town center.”"],["p","As the caravan advanced inside the state of Oaxaca this week, the group’s size, at almost five thousand people, seemed to overwhelm each new locale. San Pedro Tapanatepec, the group’s first destination in Oaxaca, has a population of roughly thirteen thousand; in Santiago Niltepec, there would be more migrants than residents, and over the weekend, the town prepared for an onslaught. One person confessed, almost ruefully, to feeling ",["em","miedito"],", a little scared. He said that he identified with the migrants and wanted to help, but he was worried that “our migrant brothers will squash us.” Another person likened the caravan to a mass of locusts descending on a field of corn. “There are good people and bad people coming in this group,” Adela Roma, who owns a pharmacy with her husband, told me. “We want to help the good ones, but how do we know who’s who?”"],["inline-embed",{"type":"callout","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22callout%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22feature-medium%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22image%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522image%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%2522%252Fphotos%252F5bd87368936ebe2cd0ab14ad%2522%252C%2522width%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522height%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522caption%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%225bd87368936ebe2cd0ab14ad%5C%22%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%22%2C%22attrs%22%3A%7B%7D%7D","ref":""},["inline-embed",{"type":"image","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22image%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22%2Fphotos%2F5bd87368936ebe2cd0ab14ad%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":"5bd87368936ebe2cd0ab14ad"}]],["inline-embed",{"type":"callout","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22callout%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22inline-ad%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cp%3Eadvertisement%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%22%2C%22attrs%22%3A%7B%7D%7D","ref":""},["p","advertisement"]],["p","The town is tucked away under an overpass off the state highway, and is easy to miss. A few semi-paved roads are lined with single-floor adobe houses fringed in tropical palms and painted in bright colors like turquoise, purple, and sky blue. Piles of rubble speckle the landscape, the result of an earthquake last year in which houses, schools, and the main government office were destroyed; the rebuilding effort has largely stalled owing to a lack of money. Many of the villagers have immigration stories of their own—brief stints spent working in the U.S., often without legal papers—and there are strong feelings of solidarity with migrants from Central America.

The store is tiny, the size of a modest bedroom, and it was crammed with large sacks of maize, flour, and rice, as well as a welter of other items packed on metal shelves along the walls. “These poor, poor people,” he said. “They had to flee. They’re hungry. Tired.” He told me that he’d learned about the caravan from distributors bringing cigarettes from Chiapas. “What we heard was that in ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/news/dispatch/the-migrant-caravan-reaches-a-crossroads-in-southern-mexico"},"Arriaga"],", they entered a store as a group.

A few days ago, when church groups and Oaxacan state-relief agencies attempted to bus women and children farther north, a number of migrants blocked the vehicles. One of them, a burly man wearing a Seattle Seahawks jersey and a straw hat, told the others, “Don’t be stupid. They’ll take the women and children away first, and then the Mexican government will come for the men to deport us.” On Saturday night, while the caravan was in San Pedro Tapanatepec, a rumor spread within the camp that someone had stolen a baby. A group began running around in pursuit of the culprit, who an observer claimed had driven off in a white van. But by ten o’clock, after a canvass of all the mothers in the caravan, it was determined that no children had gone missing. Nonetheless, the story reached residents in Santiago Niltepec, including Adela Roma at the pharmacy, who had seen postings about the stolen baby on Facebook. “We’re going to close tomorrow,” she said. “We simply can’t take any risks.”"],["inline-embed",{"type":"callout","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22callout%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22feature-medium%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22image%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522image%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%2522%252Fphotos%252F5bd8736723ddfa4b39257389%2522%252C%2522width%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522height%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522caption%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%225bd8736723ddfa4b39257389%5C%22%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%22%2C%22attrs%22%3A%7B%7D%7D","ref":""},["inline-embed",{"type":"image","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22image%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22%2Fphotos%2F5bd8736723ddfa4b39257389%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":"5bd8736723ddfa4b39257389"}]],["p","Later that afternoon, Herlinda González Luna made another announcement. “All the schools tomorrow will be closed while the caravan is here,” she said.

One villager came inside to bring her food from his truck. Across the room, five representatives from the town council huddled in a circle to make preparations for the caravan’s arrival.

Sunday night, the ultra-rightist candidate Jair Bolsonaro won the second round of Brazil’s Presidential elections. With fifty-five per cent of the vote, Bolsonaro, a former Army paratrooper who has been in congress for almost thirty years, handily defeated his rival, Fernando Haddad, the former mayor of São Paulo, by a margin of ten percentage points. In his acceptance speech, which he delivered, as has become his custom, from his home via Facebook Live, Bolsonaro promised to “pacify and unify the country” and later, in a gesture to his supporters in Brazil’s burgeoning evangelical community, bowed his head in prayer with a Protestant priest, who wore a Bolsonaro T-shirt."],["p","Bolsonaro’s victory, though not a surprise after his strong lead in the first round of voting, on October 7th, represents a seismic shift in a country that has been governed by the left for most of the past fifteen years—and it further underscores the dramatic rightward trend under way in Latin American politics. At the beginning of the decade, much of the hemisphere was ruled by a like-minded fraternity of left-of-center leaders that included Hugo Chávez, in Venezuela; Cristina Kirchner, in Argentina; and, in Brazil, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, the head of the Workers’ Party, or PT.

Just as Bolsonaro has won office because of the widely perceived failure of the political left in Brazil—and by successfully mimicking some of Trump’s pathway to success—López Obrador won in Mexico because he was seen as the antidote to a political system that had fallen prey, and become subservient to, Trump’s bullying and caprices."],["p","Globally, Bolsonaro’s imminent ascension to Brazil’s Presidency has appended Brazil to the growing ranks of nations ruled by authoritarian populists who openly espouse bigoted, misogynistic, homophobic, and anti-immigrant views, as well as violence as a means of problem-solving. Bolsonaro, a far-right extremist who has spent years shouting insults from the fringes of Brazil’s politics at women, blacks, gays, and leftists while lauding the use of torture and calling for a restoration of military rule, now represents the new mainstream."],["p","For Brazil, it is a sea change on the scale of Donald Trump’s ascension to power in the United States, with some key differences: Trump has insulted women; Bolsonaro has publicly abused a female lawmaker, shoving her and telling her she was “too ugly to deserve rape.” Trump has dog-whistled his approval of police officers using rough tactics; Bolsonaro has openly advocated a gloves-off policy regarding Brazil’s “criminal” problem in the same deadly fashion as the Filipino President, ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/11/21/when-a-populist-demagogue-takes-power"},"Rodrigo Duterte"],", saying recently, “This kind of people you cannot treat them as if they were normal human beings, O.K.? We can’t let policemen keep dying at the hands of those guys. If he kills ten, fifteen, or twenty, with ten or thirty bullets each, he needs to get a medal and not be prosecuted.”"],["p","After the results came in, Trump called Bolsonaro to congratulate him. On Monday morning, he tweeted, “Had a very good conversation with the newly elected President of Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro, who won his race by a substantial margin. We agreed that Brazil and the United States will work closely together on Trade, Military and everything else! Excellent call, wished him congrats!” Italy’s ulra-rightist Deputy Prime Minister, Matteo Salvini, expressed his delight by tweeting “the friendship between our people and our governments will be even stronger,” while Marine Le Pen, of France, also wished Bolsonaro “good luck.” Last week, Steve Bannon called Bolsonaro “a Brazilian patriot, and I believe a great leader for his country at this historic moment.”"],["p","In other echoes of Trumpish nationalism, Bolsonaro has promised to keep China at bay in Brazil’s energy and infrastructure sectors, and to retreat from Brazil’s multilateral engagements, such as the regional trade bloc known as Mercosur. He has excoriated the United Nations, calling it a “gathering place for communists,” and threatened Brazil’s withdrawal. Bolsonaro promises to align Brazil closely with Trump on foreign policy in other ways, as well. He has promised to move Brazil’s embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, to close down a Palestinian office in Brasilia, and to seek regime change in neighboring Venezuela."],["p","The value of the Brazilian currency and Brazil’s stock market have both soared on Bolsonaro’s rise, spurred, at least in part, by his promises to lift environmental controls and to open up parts of the country—including the protected Amazonian wilderness areas and the indigenous reserves—to development by large-scale mining and agribusiness interests. Reflecting Big Money’s enthusiasm, Rupert Murdoch’s ",["em","Wall Street Journal"]," recently hailed Bolsonaro in an editorial entitled “Brazilian Swamp Drainer,” with an opening line that chortles at “global progressives having an anxiety attack” over his looming victory. The editorial goes on to assert that “Mr. Bolsonaro, who has spent 27 years in Congress, is best understood as a conservative populist who promises to make Brazil great for the first time.”"],["p","Perhaps the personality whom Bolsonaro most resembles is Roberto D’Aubuisson, the late Salvadoran politician and former National Guard major who, in collusion with the security forces and conservative landowners, ran the death squads that captured and killed thousands of suspected leftists in a campaign of terror aimed at “purifying the fatherland.” (D’Aubuisson’s most prominent victim was ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/archbishop-oscar-romero-becomes-a-saint-but-his-death-still-haunts-el-salvador"},"Archbishop Oscar Arnulfo Romero"],", who was recently canonized by Pope Francis.)"],["p","Not since the early nineteen-eighties, when much of Latin America was in the grip of anti-Communist dictators who formed a cabal to kill and disappear the hemisphere’s leftists, has a politician emerged with such a vituperous discourse. Indeed, from 1964 to 1985, Brazil was part of that cabal, led by a military dictatorship that claimed the lives of several hundred of its citizens while inflicting torture and imprisonment on many thousands more. The former President Dilma Rousseff was herself a youthful guerrilla during the period, and was captured, tortured, and imprisoned by the military. During the voting for her impeachment, in 2016, a proceeding organized by her conservative political rivals, Bolsonaro, then a congressman, cast his vote in the name of the military officer who commanded the unit that was responsible for Rousseff’s mistreatment."],["p","Since the restoration of democracy, however, Brazil, unlike its neighbors, has refrained from holding anyone to task for that era’s human-rights abuses. As a result, few Brazilians alive today have much of a memory, or even an opinion about, the dictatorship that Bolsonaro has spent his career nostalgically applauding. His Vice-Presidential pick, Hamilton Mourão, a former Army general, is an unrepentant fellow best known for his remarks justifying military intervention in Brazil’s politics, if necessary, to rescue Brazil from “anarchy.”"],["p","Bolsonaro himself has promised retribution against his political foes, swearing that he will see Lula “rot” in prison and will eventually put Haddad behind bars, too. He has also pledged to go after the land-reform activists of the M.S.T.—the Movimento Sem Terra—the Landless Worker’s Movement, whom he has referred to as “terrorists.”"],["p","In a speech last week, Bolsonaro called Brazil’s leftists “red outlaws” and said that they needed to leave the country or else go to jail. “These red outlaws will be banished from our homeland,” he said. “It will be a cleanup the likes of which has never been seen in Brazilian history.” Later, referring to his supporters, he said, “We are the majority. We are the true Brazil. Together with this Brazilian people, we will make a new nation.”"]]],"canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"sections":[{"id":"5904126172dadf5d0a508800","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news","children":[{"id":"5907f159ebe912338a3717d7","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5907f159ebe912338a3717d7","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Daily Comment","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"daily-comment"},{"id":"5904126172dadf5d0a508800","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news"},{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"}],"name":"Daily Comment","parent":[{"id":"5904126172dadf5d0a508800","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"},"slug":"daily-comment"}]}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"web","contributors":[{"name":"Jon Lee Anderson","type":"author","title":"Jon Lee Anderson, a staﬀ writer, began contributing to the magazine in 1998.

Wiseman’s new film, “Monrovia, Indiana,” his forty-fourth feature, opens this Friday at Film Forum. It’s an event in itself—a documentary revelation of frozen lives and dead souls in the American heartland—and it’s also another piece in the grand mosaic of modern life that Wiseman has been composing for more than half a century. Wiseman has the most distinguished career of any documentary filmmaker in the history of cinema. Since 1967, he has been making films at the pace of nearly one a year—many running more than four hours—and it’s all the more remarkable that he didn’t get started in the first flush of film-school youth. Rather, he was working as a law-school professor when he decided to make films, and this ample experience, along with his background in literature and theatre, provided the aesthetic and intellectual energy for an original method that he has pursued, radically and steadfastly, to this day. His sense of cinematic form and his insistent investigation of institutions—whether the neighborhood archipelago of the New York Public Library, the boundaries of a town, or the confines of a hospital—make him one of the most original, and most theoretically minded, of modern directors. When I spoke with him at The New Yorker Festival, on October 6th, we discussed his new film and other highlights of his career, his distinctive practices, his ideas and principles, and the opposition that he has confronted in realizing his vision."],["p",["em","This interview has been edited and condensed."]],["p",["strong","I’d like to start talking about the new film.

I asked the superintendent, whom I knew, whether he would give me permission. And he gave me permission. But then it took a year and a half to get permission from the other state authorities. And while I was making the film that became “Titicut Follies,” I had the idea of doing a series of films on other institutions.

I was born a decade before Shepard was, and this means that I belong to a generation of queers for whom violence has been the norm. I don’t mean that we accepted it easily, or at all. In 1990, I showed up weekly for the Pink Panthers, a self-organized queer group that patrolled Greenwich Village on Friday and Saturday nights, in response to a spate of gay-bashings there. Later, I was a member of the Lesbian Avengers, the direct-action group formed, in part, in response to the murder of a lesbian and a gay man in Salem, Oregon: they had been burned alive. The violence outraged and mobilized us, but it was also an ordinary part of life, even in gay neighborhoods. And as much as we demanded it, we didn’t expect anyone to pay attention. Matthew Shepard’s killing marked a turning point."],["p","What gives me the slight sense of shame is that, twenty years later, I am still surprised that Shepard’s murder finally garnered the attention we had been demanding—the same way that I am surprised at the honor and grandeur of his long-delayed funeral. This has nothing to do with internalized homophobia, or with any other kind of homophobia: not even in the darkest part of my soul do I believe that queer people (or any other people) are any less deserving of a safe and joyful life than is anyone else. My surprise stems from a longtime habit of seeing violence as ordinary."],["p","Gay and lesbian activists had worked for decades so that American newspapers would finally cover an apparently anti-gay murder on their front pages.

Normalizing violence, on the other hand, is easy. In Russia, the government began inciting anti-gay violence in the spring of 2012. Within a few months, vigilante gangs began hunting down, beating, and torturing gay men—and sometimes killing them. By the summer of 2013, a hip café in central Moscow put up a sign announcing that anti-gay violence was not tolerated on the premises. It required a sign."],["p","I think of Russian anti-gay violence when I think of Shepard, but I also think of an interview I conducted a few years ago with Efraim Zuroff, a man who may be the last of the Nazi hunters.

The President made light of this on Twitter. Another man went into a synagogue and killed eleven people. In response, Jewish organizations, media companies, politicians, and prominent individuals will certainly obtain or increase security. They’d be crazy not to, even though most of us realize that armed guards at the door serve to further normalize violence. So, maybe it’s not so crazy that I feel that there is something extraordinary in the internment of Matthew Shepard’s ashes in the National Cathedral.

(She quoted the medieval historian Caroline Walker Bynum, who chronicles our fascination with “blood as drops and globules, shed and separated bits, as well as with . . . the redness, liquidness, the being-alive-ness, of that which is poured forth in death.”) Scholars have also located the vampire’s power in its metonymic relation to hot-button issues: disease, technology, colonialism, immigration. In 2009, Joan Acocella returned to Bram Stoker’s “",["a",{"href":"https://www.amazon.com/Dracula-Wordsworth-Classics-Bram-Stoker/dp/185326086X"},"Dracula"],"” to ask: “",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/03/16/in-the-blood"},"Why do vampires still thrill"],"?” Sociopolitical relevance might play a role, she concluded, but the real draw was all the figuration of illicit sex.

She writes that the recent swarm of “hauntings, haints and wraiths” might be read as a representation of traumatic memory, of “the past clamoring for redress.” Sehgal connects spectres in fiction to a widespread desire to examine and wrestle with unquiet history: Can a nation built out of genocide and slavery ever locate its goodness? Ghosts function as unearthly messengers; vampires, by contrast, more often serve as glamorized or partially rehabilitated villains. Since the Romantic era, their bailiwick has not been revelation nor justice, but pleasure, liberation—at a price, of course."],["p","The vampire as we know him was born in Switzerland in 1816—at the same rainy-day writing competition, held at Lord Byron’s estate on the shore of Lake Geneva, that produced Victor Frankenstein and his monster. Along with a nineteen-year-old Mary Shelley, the gathering was attended by James Polidori, Byron’s young physician, who began notes for a short story called “The Vampyr,” about a deadly, irresistible womanizer modelled in part on his boss and host. (Polidori finished his tale after he’d been fired, which may partially explain ",["a",{"href":"https://www.bl.uk/collection-items/the-vampyre-by-john-polidori"},"Lord Ruthven"],"’s ghastliness.)

This is a sentiment that registers as fatally suspect in the year of Bad Men, the year of Please, Abusers, Spare Us Your Antiheroics. Polidori’s rogue inspired a host of ",["a",{"href":"https://www.gutenberg.org/files/14833/14833-h/14833-h.htm"},"iconic vamps"],"; like “Twilight,” they found a following among the B.D.S.M.-curious, but, again, the erotics of pain hold less mainstream appeal now. The vampire, as popularly imagined, is worse than scary. He is problematic: aristocratic, pallidly European, an arch predator who targets the weak (his victims disarmed by sleep or hypnotized by charisma). He has reigned for years as an emo poet, the flower of a cult of creative introspection. In 2018, a reader may wish to focus on his political implications."],["p","A long tradition links vampires to both capitalist greed and social conservatism. In 1845, the philosopher Moses Hess defined money as “the coagulated blood of those who suffer”; Marxist theorists envisioned the bourgeoisie as “leeches” and “images of the living dead.” For Marx himself, capitalism created a wraithlike consumer society. Its commodities and values proved monstrously unreal.

Although some vampires are cast as revolutionaries (the “True Blood” tribe fought against thinly veiled racism and homophobia), the core of the myth points to rapacity, consolidation. According to Franco Moretti, a literary critic and Stanford professor, Dracula embodies a horrifying acquisitiveness: he is “impelled toward . . . continuous growth.”"],["p","One of the best things that can be said of Nick Groom’s colossally smart “",["a",{"href":"https://www.amazon.com/Vampire-New-History-Nick-Groom/dp/0300232233"},"The Vampire: A New History"],"” is that it gets the hellion out from under its humid cloud of melodramatic pining.

Groom’s basic thesis is that “vampires are good to think with.” So good, in fact, that they can be used to think about almost anything—a negative capability that, at times, leads the book into ludicrousness as it struggles to make its way back to vampires. (After a fascinating digression on how Enlightenment naturalists conceived of apes, Groom reflects that “orang-utans seem considerably more civilized than vampires,” as “vampires huddle in graves” and “orang-utans create shelters,” and “orang-utans are gatherers of the fruits of the forest” whereas “vampires hunt their prey and are without exception flesh-eaters.”) Despite their status as “roving thought-experiments,” Groom argues, vampires are historically rooted and culturally specific. They arose in the early eighteenth century, when “the traditional bloodsuckers of Eastern European folklore came face to face with empirical science.” Vampirism was a condition (whether bodily, spiritual, or psychological), with causes and treatments. Its symptoms, apprehended via witness testimony and physical fact-finding, were clothed in forensic language: ",["em","manducation"]," (the posthumous chewing of the shroud or winding fabric), ",["em","cruentation"]," (when corpses bleed afresh). A nascent rationalism was enlisted to determine the boundaries of creatures that defied rationality. For Groom, to understand this paradox is to understand vampires."],["p","As “Enlightenment beings” that challenged the epistemological precepts of the Enlightenment, vampires were unsolved riddles. They were the impossibility of knowing for sure. They became agents of what Eugene Thacker, a contemporary philosopher of horror, has called “black illumination”: a “zero degree of thought, inaccessible to the senses,” in which the divine looms in superlative absence and darkness. The vampire represents “blasphemous life,” Groom writes, “the life that is living but that should not be living.” As such, it can intimate at magical—unthinkable, unknowable—worlds. It is an artist, but not of the Keatsian type, whose gauzy seductions leave one half in love with easeful death. Its theme is the elemental quaking of the blood."],["p","It is a great relief to meet Groom’s vampire, still icy from the void and unburdened by the aesthetic of Gothic nightingale-lite. When it materializes, on the threshold of a worrisome dream, it looks nothing like what one expected, though it does seem familiar. (As the book suggests, a vampire “is the thing that inhabits one’s body but is not oneself.”) Groom quotes from the French philosopher Emmanuel Levinas, who describes the dissociation that accompanies insomnia: “This impersonality absorbs my consciousness. I do not stay awake: ‘it’ stays awake.” One might say the same thing about vampires. The cloaked fiends appear to be hibernating through 2018, and yet something mist-like and unsettling lingers. Epistemological uncertainty? Political anxiety? Psychosexual frisson? It stays awake."]]],"canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"sections":[{"id":"5908f18c98449f3364193dfd","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Books","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"books","children":[{"id":"5907eefc98449f3364193d6d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5907eefc98449f3364193d6d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Page-Turner","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"page-turner"},{"id":"5908f18c98449f3364193dfd","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Books","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"books"},{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"}],"name":"Page-Turner","parent":[{"id":"5908f18c98449f3364193dfd","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Books","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"books"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"},"slug":"page-turner"}]}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"web","contributors":[{"name":"Katy Waldman","type":"author","title":"Katy Waldman is a staff writer at \u003cem&gt;The New Yorker\u003c/em&gt;.","email":"","bio":["div",["p","Katy Waldman is a staff writer at ",["em","The New Yorker"],".

Neo-Nazis tweet swastikas and Hitler-era propaganda of leering, hook-nosed rabbis. Holocaust deniers discuss “The Protocols of the Elders of Zion” in plain view. Jewish journalists and other public figures have had their profile pictures Photoshopped onto images of lampshades and bars of soap. The name “George Soros” is no longer invoked as a dog whistle, but as an ambulance siren. “The Jewish question” is debated on alt-right blogs and news sites. In the run-up to the election, anti-Semites began to put Jewish names in sets of triple parentheses—a yellow star for the digital age, by which to un-assimilate the assimilated. Jews rushed to claim and defang the symbol, turning it into a voluntary declaration of pride, but the scar of its origins remains. For a time after ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump"},"Donald Trump"],"’s election, I collected screenshots of racist and anti-Semitic hate speech I came across. Then I stopped. The proof was everywhere, plain as day."],["p","It seems clear that anti-Semitism has burrowed into the American mainstream in a way not seen since the late nineteen-thirties and early nineteen-forties, when it also fused easily with conservative isolationist fervor and racism. In “",["a",{"href":"https://www.amazon.com/These-Truths-History-United-States/dp/0393635244"},"These Truths"],",” her masterful new history of this country, my colleague Jill Lepore writes about the anti-Semites of that period, who saw “mass democracy and mass culture as harbingers of the decline of Western civilization.” In 1939, the German-American Bund held a pro-Nazi rally at Madison Square Garden, attended by twenty thousand people; you can watch footage of it ",["a",{"href":"https://www.theatlantic.com/video/index/542499/marshall-curry-nazi-rally-madison-square-garden-1939/"},"here"],", and, as vile as it is, I suggest that you do. Amid the sieg-heils, you will see Fritz Kuhn, the Bund’s leader, railing against the “Jewish-controlled press” as he lays out his vision for a “socially just, white, Gentile-ruled United States.” “We, with our American ideals, demand that the American government shall be returned to the American people who founded it,” he says, to cheers."],["p","Not long ago, I came across a description—published in the March, 1939, bulletin of the men’s club at New York’s Ansche Chesed synagogue—of a counter-rally held a couple of weeks later, at Carnegie Hall. “Stressing that racial intolerance was un-American, speaker after speaker denounced the activities of the German-American Bund,” the bulletin reports. “The need for protecting our democratic processes was on the lips of everyone and strong sentiment of solidarity to protect democracy and racial and religious freedom that goes with it was prevalent throughout.” That sense of solidarity, which, for me, as for many, is at the moral center of the American-Jewish experience, was explicitly attacked in Pittsburgh on Saturday. It has been reported that, a few weeks ago, the alleged gunman furiously ",["a",{"href":"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/27/us/active-shooter-pittsburgh-synagogue-shooting.html"},"railed"]," on social media against ",["em",{"class":"small"},"HIAS"],", the ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/why-the-tree-of-life-shooter-was-fixated-on-the-hebrew-immigrant-aid-society"},"Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society"],", which was founded, at the turn of the last century, to help the waves of Jewish immigrants who left imperial Russia for America. The organization later worked to resettle Jews fleeing Nazi Germany, and currently serves immigrants and refugees of all backgrounds. It is a bitter irony that that sense of common cause has now been further strengthened, as the Tree of Life joins Mother Emanuel A.M.E. Church, in Charleston, South Carolina, Dar Al-Farooq Islamic Center, in Bloomington, Minnesota, and so many other houses of worship as points on a dark map of ongoing American tragedy."]]],"canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"sections":[{"id":"5904126172dadf5d0a508800","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news","children":[{"id":"5907f159ebe912338a3717d7","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5907f159ebe912338a3717d7","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Daily

If there is, they take that information to law enforcement, and share it with reporters and the public. I asked Beirich for her thoughts on the news coverage of acts of mass violence, and the debate over the merits of broadcasting perpetrators’ beliefs. “I understand the argument: don’t give these people too much ink, or airtime, because you’re just spreading the propaganda,” she said. “But the truth is these people are committing so much violence, and their ideas are actually influencing public policy—the Muslim ban, the immigration stuff thats going on—I don’t think you can ignore it.”"],["p","Even for Beirich and her team, who study the nexus of hate and violence professionally, this week—with the pipe bombs mailed to prominent Democrats, and the ",["a",{"href":"https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/26/us/kentucky-kroger-shooting/index.html"},"deliberate shooting"]," of two black people by a white man in Kentucky—was overwhelming. “We’re just exhausted and stressed out, like the rest of the country is,” she said.

The F.B.I.’s data may not even be the full picture, she pointed out, saying, “Not every state has a hate-crime law, many that do don’t cover the L.G.B.T. population, and there’s no training for law enforcement.”"],["p","The suspect in the Pittsburgh shooting was identified on Saturday as Robert Bowers.
