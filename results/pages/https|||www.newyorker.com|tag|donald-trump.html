at least in one respect, is still President Trump’s kind of town. Trump, searching for good news amid the daily flood of revelations and reversals, can find plenty of it in a place the author Mark Leibovich memorably, and correctly, labelled “Suck-Up City.” On Tuesday, the President held a press conference with the Polish President, Andrzej Duda, as his aides huddled in crisis meetings elsewhere in the White House with ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/brett-kavanaugh"},"Brett Kavanaugh"],", Trump’s Supreme Court nominee, who is facing an allegation of sexual assault from several decades ago. Trump had a friend by his side in Duda, a hard-right nationalist who offered him more than the usual flowery compliments that fellow world leaders have taken to lavishing on the flattery-loving President. “Ladies and gentlemen,” Duda told the reporters, “I was smiling when talking to Mr. President. I said that I would very much like for us to set up permanent American bases in Poland, which we would call Fort Trump.” Trump didn’t accept on the spot, but he made it clear that he was delighted by the idea, all the more so since Poland offered to cover the two-billion-dollar price tag."],["p","Offering to slap Trump’s name on a multibillion-dollar military installation is a new one in the annals of Trump suck-up-ery, and Duda’s Polish political rivals quickly bemoaned it. “What an embarrassment in front of the entire world!” a former Polish defense minister tweeted. “Even leaders of banana republics had more respect for themselves and their countries than President Duda does.” But, while extreme, it is by no means an isolated incident."],["p","Even Trump’s trademark insults these days are often met not with angry retorts but with lavish praise for the President. Consider the case of Trump’s frequent target Jeff Sessions, his own Attorney General. For more than a year, Trump has publicly assailed Sessions for recusing himself from the Russia investigation, a move that Trump blames for triggering the special-counsel probe. His broadsides against Sessions have become so common that we tend to forget how extraordinary it is to see the President publicly attacking the nation’s chief law-enforcement officer while leaving him in his job. Later on Tuesday, after his press conference with Duda, the President gave a TV interview to ",["em","The Hill"]," in which he went after Sessions in particularly savage terms. “I don’t have an attorney general,” Trump said. “It’s very sad.”"],["p","Still, Sessions, already a model of turn-the-other-cheek forbearance when confronted with Trump’s previous insults (which have included, according to ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/news/letter-from-trumps-washington/crazytown-a-bob-woodward-book-an-anonymous-new-york-times-op-ed-and-a-growing-crisis-for-the-trump-presidency"},"the new Bob Woodward book"],", calling Sessions “mentally retarded” and a “dumb Southerner”), chose to respond by flattering the boss. In a Wednesday speech to law-enforcement officials in Waukegan, Illinois, he “effusively praised” Trump, as the Washington ",["em","Post"]," put it. “Under his strong leadership, we are respecting police again and enforcing our laws,” Sessions said. “Based on my experience meeting with officers like you across the country, I believe that morale has already improved under President Trump. I can feel the difference.”"],["p","Capitol Hill, where Sessions spent two decades as a Republican senator before joining the Trump Administration, has long been considered the epicenter of sucking up in Washington, with so many big egos crammed together in one building, all of them exquisitely attuned to the city’s ever-shifting hierarchies of power. In his twenty months as President, Trump has seen firsthand the shift on the Hill among formerly skeptical elected Republicans, most of whom (aside from Sessions) were not enthusiastic supporters of his Presidential campaign. The South Carolina Republican Lindsey Graham called Trump a “kook” when he ran against him in the 2016 primaries, before becoming one of the President’s closest confidants in the Senate and his frequent public defender. Ted Cruz, another 2016 rival, called Trump “utterly amoral” and a “pathological liar” before endorsing him; now he’s bringing Trump to Texas to campaign for him in ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/beto-orourke-john-mccain-and-respecting-fellow-americans"},"an unexpectedly close"]," November race. Few senators, however, have flip-flopped on the subject of Trump more dramatically than Dean Heller, the highly vulnerable Nevada Republican who welcomed the President for a campaign rally in Las Vegas on Thursday.

Whitehouse, a former prosecutor, and other legal veterans had just written to Trump demanding that the F.B.I. reopen its background check of Kavanaugh; Whitehouse told me he considered it “malpractice” to treat a sexual-assault claim in so dismissive a fashion, and he vowed not to let it go and to keep investigating if Democrats win back control of Congress. “What a complete botch the Republican majority on the committee has made of it,” he said, adding pointedly, “Don’t presume this goes away . . . if Kavanaugh is confirmed, we just say, ‘Oh, well, never mind.’ . . . It’s too bad to just walk away from.”"],["p","Conventional wisdom in both parties, however, had once again settled on the idea that Kavanaugh was now likely to be confirmed, although possibly on much more of a party-line vote than previously thought, as vulnerable Democrats in Republican-leaning states that Trump won feel freer to vote against a Trump nominee with a cloud over him. “I would say they are going to ram it through, and it is going to have enormous electoral consequences,” one chief of staff to an anti-Kavanaugh Democratic senator told me. “They are going to pay a much steeper price if they do it that way. For electoral purposes, they are going to end up in a much harder place with Republican women.” Another Democratic chief of staff involved in the vote-counting unsentimentally walked me through the numbers as they stood late Wednesday. “At one point, we thought we had three to five Democrats in favor of Kavanaugh,” he said. “I think that’s done with now,” as Democrats from pro-Trump states, like Heidi Heitkamp, of North Dakota, and Joe Donnelly, of Indiana, now have a readymade reason to vote no. It’s a “chess game that’s being played right now, and they”—the Republicans—“are losing,” the Democratic chief of staff argued. “The chess on this is that you’ve united the Democrats.”"],["p","Conversations with two chiefs of staff to senators who are still publicly undecided suggested this analysis is correct. At least for now. By this weekend, of course, a new political reality may prevail. “It could make my boss’s decision easier,” one of them told me, “but it does not make the politics of this any better.” The other fence-sitter I spoke with agreed. The whole Kavanaugh situation, he told me, was “such a mess,” “unbelievable,” and a “debacle.” Watching it play out, he was listening to old tapes of Hill being questioned by the Judiciary Committee and fearing a dreadful repeat. “It’s horrible for everybody. It’s horrible for Ford. It’s horrible for Kavanaugh. It’s horrible for us. Except for insane advocates on the far left and far right, nobody wins,” he said. Listening to him, it was hard not to feel that being an undecided senator in the polarized political world of Trump’s America may well rate as one of Washington’s more unpleasant experiences."],["p","Which, of course, is part of the reason the splendid art of sucking up has so many political adherents at this moment. Two of the Senate’s most skilled practitioners of the art of Trump flattery, in fact, emerged as particularly vocal defenders of Kavanaugh amid the week’s political turmoil. Heller, before flying back to Nevada to host Trump, called the assault allegation against the Supreme Court nominee a mere “hiccup,” and demanded a quick resolution. Graham went even further, alleging that Ford was part of a plot to bring down a Trump-backed nominee. Democrats, he told his fellow Trump confidant Sean Hannity, in a Fox News interview, “can’t beat him on the law, so they are trying to destroy his life.”"]]],"canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"sections":[{"id":"5904126172dadf5d0a508800","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news","children":[{"id":"5abaab1276329f082506d466","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5abaab1276329f082506d466","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Letter from Trump’s Washington","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"letter-from-trumps-washington"},{"id":"5904126172dadf5d0a508800","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news"},{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"}],"name":"Letter from Trump’s Washington","parent":[{"id":"5904126172dadf5d0a508800","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"},"slug":"letter-from-trumps-washington"}]}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"web","contributors":[{"name":"Susan B.

But the fear around his Presidency has nothing to do with his skillful use of intimidation, and everything to do with the dangerous consequences of his erratic behavior. At Trump’s core lies a need always to look strong, which, of course, makes him look weak. In several scenes, one adviser or another struggles to find the right, flattering words that will keep the President from starting a nuclear war."],["p","No one has any respect for Trump. In the course of the book, his chief of staff calls him “an idiot”; his Secretary of State ups it to “a fucking moron”; his Secretary of Defense compares him to an eleven-year-old; his top economic adviser and his personal lawyer consider him, respectively, “a professional liar” and “a fucking liar.” (Various denials have been issued.) Gary Cohn, the economic adviser, tells the President to his face that he’s “a fucking asshole,” while Trump calls Cohn “a fucking globalist.” When Cohn first tries to resign, Trump mocks him for being under his wife’s thumb, not to mention treasonous. There’s no end to the Cabinet members and generals whom Trump is eager to insult in front of their colleagues, or to fire by tweet. A coarse and feckless viciousness is the operating procedure of his White House, and the poison spreads to everyone. Only snakes and sycophants survive."],["p","You might have already sensed this, but you didn’t know it with such nauseating specificity.

The presentation quickly collapses under ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/steve-bannon"},"Steve Bannon"],"’s sophistic questioning. Trump, who cares only about scoring a profit off allies, keeps repeating, “It’s all bullshit!” He announces his intention to tear up the defense treaty with South Korea—“Pull the fucking thing out! I don’t give a shit”—and soon leaves."],["p","South Korea—its trade surplus with the United States, the cost of American troops and defense systems there—is an obsession of Trump’s, and perhaps the closest thing in “Fear” to an organizing narrative principle. The book begins with Cohn removing a one-paragraph letter that awaits Trump’s signature on the Oval Office desk and that would end the Korean-American trade agreement. Cohn is counting on the President’s flickering consciousness to make him forget about the letter and the impulse to undermine an important ally. But Trump keeps demanding another draft, for destroying alliances is—along with hatred of the press—his genuine, unquenchable passion in politics. His stamina in pursuit of these demons is impressive. Every day in his White House has the disintegrating feel of final days, but the next day is the same, and the story never ends."],["p","Even though Woodward rarely quotes people speaking to him directly, it isn’t hard to discern some of his main White House sources: Cohn; Trump’s first chief of staff, ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/reince-priebus"},"Reince Priebus"],"; his staff secretary Rob Porter.

Woodward’s reporting exposes, perhaps inadvertently, what a hollow conceit this is."],["p","Priebus, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, sees everything in terms of political advantage, and encourages Trump’s polarizing instinct to govern as the President of his base. Cohn, the Democrat in the group, decides not to resign over Trump’s softness on white nationalism, in order to push through a hugely regressive tax bill that leaves the next generation with almost two trillion dollars of debt. Tariffs, not neo-Nazis, finally persuade him to quit. Steve Mnuchin, the Treasury Secretary, is reduced to grovelling. “I’m with you,” he assures Trump, after the meeting in the Tank.

We don’t yet know the outcome of Robert Mueller’s investigation into collusion and obstruction of justice, but in a sense it doesn’t matter. The real crime is already in plain sight. ♦"]]],"canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"sections":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine","children":[{"id":"592dfa44d5fda942c34a0b61","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"592dfa44d5fda942c34a0b61","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Comment","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"comment"},{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"},{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"}],"name":"Comment","parent":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"},"slug":"comment"}]}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"magazine","contributors":[{"name":"George Packer","type":"author","title":"George Packer became a staff writer in 2003.

As part of the plea, he agreed to coöperate with the special counsel, Robert Mueller. Manafort will lose several properties, the money in several bank accounts, and a life-insurance policy, which appear to have value well in excess of ten million dollars. In exchange, Manafort was assured that he will spend no more than a decade in prison for the two charges, so long as he fully coöperates with Mueller."],["p","We don’t know much more.

But, even if Manafort had very little helpful to offer, he said, “this is a good deal for Mueller.” Mueller gets another guilty plea and avoids a potential loss at trial, which serves to undercut Trump’s repeated argument that the Mueller investigation is a “witch hunt.” Even if Mueller already knows everything that Manafort has to offer, it would be helpful to have another voice confirming details at some future criminal trial for some other defendant."],["p","At a minimum, Manafort should be able to provide more information about the Trump Tower meeting, in June, 2016, in which Donald Trump, Jr., Manafort, and Jared Kushner sat down with the Kremlin-associated lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya and several others from the former Soviet Union. It is one of the more explicit moments in which senior members of the Trump campaign met with people close to the Kremlin to discuss working together to help elect Trump. Among the Trump team, Manafort would be, by far, the most experienced in dealing with emissaries from Russia and its allies, and the one most likely to understand the various agendas of those present. He surely knows what he told Trump, Jr., Trump himself, Kushner, and others about the significance of the meeting. And, because Manafort has deep ties to many business and political associates of Vladimir Putin, he could well know about other possible connections between the Trump campaign and the Russian government."],["p","As Franklin Foer ",["a",{"href":"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/09/paul-manafort-cooperating-mueller/570364/"},"writes in ",["em","The Atlantic"]],", Manafort can also potentially shed light on several key people and a number of events that the public still knows too little about.

Rather than merely informing on others, this theory holds that he would be able to lay out the full story of collusion (if, indeed, there was any). However, this plea agreement is not overly generous. It strips Manafort of much of his wealth and means that the man, who is sixty-nine years old, will likely spend a decade in prison. Perhaps this agreement is subterfuge designed to prevent the news media, the President, and other possible witnesses and defendants from concluding that Manafort’s coöperation is so valuable that the investigation is all but over. That seems unlikely. The simplest reading is that Manafort has offered information with real value to Mueller, but that it’s not so crucial that we can consider the case closed. This could be because Manafort doesn’t know as much as we might imagine, or, more likely, that Mueller already knows most of what Manafort could tell him."],["p","Manafort—through his guilty verdicts in last month’s trial stemming from various financial charges and his guilty plea on Friday—has already deepened our knowledge of blatant corruption and illegality among those close to Trump. No doubt he can help Mueller find even more. (Other potential witnesses, such as ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/news-desk/swamp-chronicles/allen-weisselberg-the-man-who-knows-donald-trumps-financial-secrets-has-agreed-to-become-a-cooperating-witness"},"Allen Weisselberg"]," and ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/news-desk/swamp-chronicles/the-president-has-been-implicated-in-a-criminal-conspiracy"},"Michael Cohen"],", surely know far more about Trump’s own shady business dealings). But, in the end, the Mueller investigation will likely come down to one central question: Did senior members of the Trump campaign, with the explicit knowledge of Trump himself, actively work with Russian government actors to help sway the election so that Trump would win? If the answer is yes, then Trump will almost certainly be impeached and removed from office."],["p","If Manafort were in a position to definitively answer that question, it seems unlikely he would have accepted this plea agreement. He would have been in a position to hold out for something far better."],["p"]]],"canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"sections":[{"id":"5904126172dadf5d0a508800","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news","children":[{"id":"590a02541c7a8e33fb390be1","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"590a02541c7a8e33fb390be1","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News Desk","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news-desk"},{"id":"5904126172dadf5d0a508800","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news"},{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"}],"name":"News Desk","parent":[{"id":"5904126172dadf5d0a508800","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"},"slug":"news-desk"}]}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"web","contributors":[{"name":"Adam Davidson","type":"author","title":"Adam Davidson is a staff writer at The New Yorker.","email":"","bio":["div",["p","Adam Davidson is a staff writer at ",["em","The New Yorker"],", covering business,\ntechnology, and economics.

Mercifully, the Secret Service intercepted two of the packages, and none of the others exploded. So far, nobody has come forward claiming to have been the sender. Until that happens, or the F.B.I. nabs the perpetrator, caution should be exercised in attributing responsibility. But a few things are already clear.\n\nOne is that all of the targets were people whom Donald Trump has lambasted in his campaign rallies and outpourings on Twitter. They are also people who have been subjected to hateful abuse online by Trump supporters and alt-right groups. (In the case of Soros, as my colleague Eric Lach [pointed out](https://www.newyorker.com/news/current/the-bombs-addressed-to-obama-clinton-and-soros-and-the-history-of-soros-mongering) earlier, the attacks aren’t limited to the United States, and they go back years.) \n\nWe also know that the package to Brennan was sent to CNN, which Trump has repeatedly demonized, calling it “fake news” and “the enemy of the American people.” He has used the same inflammatory language about other news organizations, and, on occasion, he has appeared to encourage his supporters to take matters into their own hands. Last week, at a rally in Montana, he showered praise on a Republican congressman, Greg Gianforte, who, last year, assaulted a reporter for the *Guardian*. “Any guy that can do a body slam, he’s my kind of—he’s my guy,” Trump [said](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2018/oct/19/laughter-as-trump-lauds-politicians-body-slam-of-journalist-video), to loud cheers. \n\nIn reacting to the news about the pipe bombs, the White House didn’t mention any of this, of course. “These terrorizing acts are despicable, and anyone responsible will be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law,” Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said in a statement. Trump initially stayed away from the cameras. Then, on Wednesday afternoon, speaking at a White House meeting on the opioid crisis, he [said](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/412980-trump-we-will-get-to-the-bottom-of-explosive-mailers-to-democrats), “The full weight of our government is being deployed to conduct this investigation and bring those responsible for these despicable acts to justice.” He added, “I just want to tell you that in these times we have to unify. We have to come together and send one very clear, strong, unmistakable message that acts or threats of political violence of any kind have no place in the United States of America.” \n\nThis statement of principle was welcome, if long overdue. But, unless Trump follows up by changing his behavior and his rhetoric in a fundamental way, his words will prove to have been empty. Will he now cease his attacks on the media? “The President, and especially the White House press secretary, should understand their words matter,” Jeff Zucker, the president of CNN, noted in a statement. “Thus far, they have shown no comprehension of that.” Actually, Zucker’s reading was a generous one. In targeting journalists and news organizations, Trump may well understand exactly what he is doing, and the dangers it entails. Nothing in his prior record suggests that he will alter course. Will he tone down his rhetoric in other ways? Will his supporters refrain from spreading baseless claims about Soros, the latest of which was that he had helped organize the caravan of refugees from Honduras?”\n\nThere are plenty of grounds for skepticism. Even before Trump spoke, some right-wing pundits and provocateurs were busy spreading another outrageous conspiracy theory. “These ‘Suspicious Package’ stories are false flags, carefully planned for the midterms,” Jacob Wohl, a Trump supporter and a writer at the Web site The Gateway Pundit, wrote on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/JacobAWohl/status/1055105429712207872). The Daily Beast [reported](https://www.thedailybeast.com/pro-trump-media-insists-bomb-threats-against-clinton-obama-cnn-are-pure-bs-a-false-flag) that Frank Gaffney, a former Reagan Administration official, and Michael Flynn, Jr., the son of Trump’s former national-security adviser, had voiced similar opinions. On his daily radio show, Rush Limbaugh muttered, “It’s happening in October. There’s a reason for this.”\n\nWe shall see what the investigation turns up. But we don’t need the F.B.I. or the Secret Service to inform us that, for years now, Limbaugh and his fellow Trump followers have been busy creating a feverish political environment in which outlandish and defamatory conspiracy theories routinely get propagated and believed—from “Pizzagate” to the latest Soros slur. We should also be well aware, by now, that in a country as divided and media-saturated as the United States the dividing line between political incitement and deadly violence is dangerously thin.\n\nOn December 4, 2016, Edgar Maddison Welch, a twenty-eight-year-old from North Carolina, turned up at the Comet Ping Pong pizza restaurant, in Washington, D.C., and fired a shot from a semi-automatic rifle, terrifying the staff and patrons. He later said he was convinced that the restaurant was involved in a child-sex ring tied to Hillary Clinton, a baseless theory he had picked up online. \n\nOn August 12, 2017, in Charlottesville, Virginia, James Alex Fields, Jr., a twenty-year-old from Ohio who had espoused white-supremacist beliefs, drove his Dodge Challenger into a crowd protesting against a Unite the Right rally, killing Heather Heyer, a thirty-two-year-old paralegal who was part of a counter-protest. Fields has been charged with second-degree murder and hate crimes.\n\nTwo months earlier, James Hodgkinson, a sixty-six-year-old resident of Belleville, Illinois, who supported Bernie Sanders and had called Donald Trump a “traitor” online, walked onto a ball field outside the Y.M.C.A. in Arlington, Virginia, and opened fire at members of a Republican congressional baseball team. Steve Scalise, the third-ranking member of the House Republican caucus, was critically wounded, and two members of the Capitol Police, among others, suffered lesser wounds.\n\nTo many people who knew them, Welch, who is serving a four-year prison term; Field, who is awaiting trial; and Hodgkinson, who was shot dead by the police during his attack, seemed like unremarkable people. In a heavily armed nation of three hundred and twenty-five million people, it is frightening to think about how many other folks could follow a similar path to violence if the United States continues on its current trajectory under its current leader. (The fact that Hodgkinson espoused liberal beliefs was a reminder that, in a febrile environment of hatred and animosity, it isn’t only right-wingers who can become unhinged.)\n\nA few days after the clashes in Charlottesville, my colleague Robin Wright [interviewed](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/is-america-headed-for-a-new-kind-of-civil-war) Keith Mines, a former member of the U.S. Special Forces who has extensive experience in countries wracked by violent internal conflicts, including El Salvador, Iraq, and Afghanistan. Identifying some of the precursors to such conflicts, Mines pointed to entrenched polarization, weakened political institutions, irresponsible political leadership, and the legitimization of violence. “We keep saying, ‘It can’t happen here,’&amp;nbsp;” Mines said, “but then, holy smokes, it can.” On a day like this, we barely need reminding.

Ambassador, had referred to Kushner as the Trump Administration’s “hidden genius,” and he also gushed about Kushner’s ability to use the “cell-phone approach” rather than his father-in-law’s “megaphone approach” to work across the aisle on a prison-reform bill. \n\nJones’s softball questions brought down upon him a predictable outpouring of venom on [social media](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2018/10/23/how-did-you-get-this-job-van-jones-asked-jared-kushner-internet-answered/). But it was in keeping with the normal ethos of corporate “thought leader” conferences, where the trick is to make the attendees feel like they have been granted temporary access to an élite circle of super-smart insiders. Despite the obvious shortcomings of the interview, however, it wasn’t entirely unenlightening. In a rare public appearance, Kushner revealed himself as a soft-spoken but supremely self-confident figure, a person who clearly doesn’t consider his thin résumé to be a handicap in tackling some of the world’s thorniest issues. And, after about seventeen minutes, Jones finally got down to business, asking him whether he believed the Saudi account of what happened to Khashoggi.\n\n“We’re obviously getting as many facts as we can from the different places, and then we’ll determine which facts are credible,” Kushner said. That was flannel, but then things got kind of interesting, as Kushner provided what appeared to be a strategic rationale for going soft on the crown prince or, at least, giving him some more time to come up with a less risible cover story for Khashoggi’s murder: “I’ll also say that we have to be able to work with our allies,” Kushner said. “And Saudi Arabia has been a very strong ally in terms of pushing back against Iran’s aggression, which is funding a lot of terror in the region, whether it’s the Houthis in Yemen or Hezbollah and Hamas, we have a lot of terrorism in the region. The Middle East is a rough place. It’s been a rough place for a very long time, and we have to be able to pursue our strategic objectives, but we also have to deal with what obviously seems to be a terrible situation.” \n\nIf this was pragmatism, it was pragmatism colored by a very particular and one-sided view of the world. Yes, the Middle East is a troubled place, but it is also a complicated one. Until pretty recently, Iranian-backed militias were fighting inside Iraq alongside U.S.-backed forces in the war against *ISIS*{:.small}. In casting the overriding issue in the Middle East as Iranian aggression, Kushner was promulgating a simplistic, ahistorical line favored by the Saudi monarchy, Benjamin Netanyahu’s government in Israel, and many of the same Washington foreign-policy “experts” who dragged the United States into the war in Iraq. \n\nTo portray the many Saudi atrocities in Yemen as “pushing back against Iran’s aggression” isn’t merely misleading: it is outrageous. Jones didn’t pick up on that one. But he did ask Kushner whether he trusted the Saudis to investigate themselves, given that the crown prince “is like the prime suspect who is also the prime investigator.” Kushner confirmed that he had spoken personally to the prince, advising him to be “fully transparent,” because “this is a very, very serious accusation, and a very serious situation.” However, Kushner then declined to take Jones’s invitation to say that Khashoggi’s murder had shaken his confidence in his Saudi partner. Instead, he returned to his previous theme, saying Saudi Arabia is a “critical partner” in the fight against terrorism, praising some of the domestic reforms the crown prince had introduced, and concluding by saying, “We are hopeful we can keep pushing forward with a lot of the initiatives that further American interests and push back against Iran’s aggression, and we are going to stay focussed on that.”\n\nBefore moving on to other subjects, Jones raised another thorny question: To what extent, if any, is the Trump Administration culpable, at least by association, for the crown prince’s brutal policies, including what happened to Khashoggi? Jones didn’t phrase his question precisely in this way. Instead, he asked Kushner how he reacted to people who “are mad at Jared Kushner,” because they believe that the crown prince killed Khashoggi and “it’s your fault because if you hadn’t been friends with him he wouldn’t have felt like he could get away with it.” \n\nKushner quickly brushed the question aside, saying, “Look, I don’t respond to the critics.” But, of course, he had already responded in his previous statements, and in what he had chosen not to say. Without prejudicing the outcomes of the various investigations into Khashoggi’s death, Kushner, a former newspaper proprietor, after all, could surely have asserted the principle that the United States shouldn’t embrace dictators who order the killing of journalists employed by American newspapers. He didn’t do it, and the omission spoke volumes.

Others were sent to the former President Barack Obama; the former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton; the former Vice-President Joe Biden; the former Attorney General Eric Holder; Robert De Niro, the actor, who has been critical of Trump; and the former C.I.A. director John Brennan, care of CNN. (At the Houston rally, when Trump referred to the “fake-news media,” the crowd chanted, “CNN sucks!” He smiled in response.) An explosive had already been found in a mailbox at the New York state home of [George Soros](https://www.newyorker.com/news/current/the-bombs-addressed-to-obama-clinton-and-soros-and-the-history-of-soros-mongering). Most of the packages had a half-dozen first-class stamps on them and return labels with the office address and misspelled name of Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz; the one sent to Holder was misaddressed, and so was redirected to her. Wasserman Schultz is a Florida Democrat who, as the chair of the Democratic National Committee, was often the focus of Trump’s insults and insinuations during the 2016 Presidential campaign. \n\nThat rhetorical role is often filled now by, as Trump said in Houston, “Max-eeeeeeeene Waters.” He drew out the syllable long enough for the crowd to summon up an image of the congresswoman, who is African-American, and remind them of all the blanks they were supposed to fill in. Just in case, he prodded them. “You get that one? You get that—Max? She’s going to be in charge of your finances! Maxine—good old Maxine. Low I.Q. individual! Low I.Q.”\n\nWaters could become the chair of the House Financial Services Committee if the Democrats take back the House. Chairing that committee, which oversees the Fed and bank regulators, isn’t the same as controlling “your finances,” but it would still allow Waters more authority, apparently, than Trump thinks she has any call to have. Trump told the crowd that a vote for Democrats was a vote to “surrender” Congress to her and to other Democrats he insulted. (There was a Pocahontas reference, to Elizabeth Warren, too.) And the warnings about how they would handle committees were the tame part. “You know how the caravan started?” Trump said, miming a person handing out cash. “Does everybody know what this means? Huh?” This was an apparent reference to a video that a Republican congressman, in what might best be described as an exercise in imaginative projection, claims depicts someone—perhaps an agent of Soros?—paying people to join a group of Guatemalan and Honduran migrants headed north through Mexico, which was widely circulated on social media. This claim is [not remotely](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/20/world/americas/migrant-caravan-video-trump.html) [substantiated](https://www.factcheck.org/2018/10/no-evidence-soros-is-funding-immigrant-caravan/), and Soros’s Open Society Foundation has denied it. But Trump was on the case. “I think the Democrats had something to do with it,” he said, raising an index finger in the air, like a latter-day Encyclopedia Brown. The caravan is, he said, “an assault on our country. That’s an *assault*.” \n\nNo one knows at this point who sent the devices, or why. (Nor is it clear yet how effective they would have been as bombs; press accounts suggest they were crudely constructed and technically flawed.) These are unsettled times, in which fears have taken hold in many quarters. As my colleague John Cassidy, [surveying the field](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/the-dangerously-thin-line-between-political-incitement-and-political-violence), notes, this has included a gun attack on congressional Republicans playing baseball; someone also sent ricin to Trump and to one of his in-laws. These tendencies and terrors of hidden forces are present widely in America and always have been. What is distinct about this moment is that the President himself is so eager to stoke them. Trump has a homing instinct for where caches of resentment and anxiety are stored, and how they can be exploited to persuade people that we are in the midst of a crisis that only he can fix—with the help of his vigilant supporters. The packages also had in common the fact that they were targeted at people whom the President and his allies have spoken of as extra-judicial actors, even criminals, masquerading as politicians and civil servants in their efforts to undermine the country. He has referred to Holder as the person who “protected” Obama and the Clintons; when he does so, he can sound almost jealous. Others on the list, like Soros and Waters, are people who, he has implied, have no business being involved in public life at all. \n\nIn confronting his enemies and theirs, Trump tells the crowds, the country is already on a military footing. Tough-minded *ICE*{: .small} agents were clearing out MS-13 “nests.” Suburban towns in Long Island, he told the crowd in Houston, have to be “liberated,” adding, “You see the people, they’re clapping from their windows. I’m telling you, it’s like a war, a war zone.” Our cities are beset by the sort of “animal” criminal whose acts are inextricable from “chain migration.” When he praised Senator Ted Cruz—the ostensible point of the rally was to support Cruz in his race against [Beto O’Rourke](https://www.newyorker.com/news/current/beto-orourke-and-ted-cruzs-fidgety-pinched-debate), and to give Cruz, who long ago traded dignity for demagoguery, a chance to abase himself in front of Trump—he said that Cruz had done a good job “staring down an angry left-wing mob in our recent Supreme Court battle victory.” He added, “If you want America to endure as a sovereign, independent nation, go out and vote Republican.” The mob has a well-ordered plan, apparently, to sell out our sovereignty. \n\nThere was another rally—this time in Wisconsin, to support Governor Scott Walker—on Wednesday, the day that the Time Warner Center, in New York, was evacuated because of [the package that had arrived at CNN’s offices](https://www.newyorker.com/news/current/what-it-was-like-in-the-cnn-newsroom-when-news-broke-of-a-bomb-in-the-building) there, with similar scenes at congressional offices, and news that the Secret Service had intercepted the packages sent to Obama and to Clinton. Trump began by promising an “aggressive” investigation, and condemned violence perpetrated in the name of politics. “Great country,” he said. “Going to get along.” As he spoke, he sounded both like someone reciting an obligatory disclaimer and strangely aggrieved, as though he were the true victim of the day’s events. When he said that “those engaged in the political arena must stop treating political opponents as morally defective,” he certainly didn’t seem to be reflecting on his portrayal of Waters. He added, “No one should carelessly compare political opponents to historical villains” or “mob people in public places.” Having worked in the word “mob,” his shorthand for Democrats and all they bring with them, he praised himself for “behaving.”\n\nHe also spoke, again, about how America is being “assaulted,” and how the Democrats are complicit in bringing “known gang-members, predators, criminal aliens into our community.” And he said that the media, whose members had been threatened that same day, have “a responsibility to set a civil tone and to stop the endless hostility and constant negative and oftentimes false attacks and stories. Have to do it.” By that, apparently, Trump meant stories about Trump. The next morning, on Twitter, after complaining about a *Times* story on his security-precaution-defying cell-phone habits, he blamed the media even more emphatically: “A very big part of the Anger we see today in our society is caused by the purposely false and inaccurate reporting of the Mainstream Media that I refer to as Fake News. It has gotten so bad and hateful that it is beyond description. Mainstream Media must clean up its act, FAST!” That is, it must come around to his way of seeing things fast. And if it doesn’t, then what?

How many people were from Iowa, he asked, and how many were from Nebraska, and which side could cheer the loudest? “I’m going to go ‘Iowa’ first, then I’m going to go ‘Nebraska,’&amp;nbsp;” he said. “I just want to see who the hell I’m speaking to!” He had the crowd do it twice, to be sure of the result—or maybe because he likes to hear cheering—and ended the exercise with his arms raised in mock astonishment at the greater size and loudness of the Nebraska contingent. There was no real surprise: Omaha is just across the Missouri River from Council Bluffs. He also won Nebraska by a wider margin in 2016 than he did Iowa. And, while the point of the rally was to support local Republican candidates in the midterms, his mind also seemed to be on 2020\\. \n\n“The Democrats have become too extreme. And they’ve become, frankly, too dangerous to govern. They’ve gone *wacko*,” he said, pointing to his temple to emphasize the word. “They’ve gone so far left that they consider Pocahontas to be a rational person.” He meant, of course, Senator Elizabeth Warren, of Massachusetts, who has said that her family’s oral traditions include accounts of Native American ancestry, and once listed herself that way in a law-school directory, but acknowledges that she cannot claim membership in any recognized tribe. (Trump’s supposed outrage at her presumption is, to put it mildly, undermined by his use of the label “Pocahontas.”) “Oh, I hope she runs, I hope she runs,” he said. His only worry, he told the crowd, was that, if he says too much about Warren and other potential contenders, “I’ll knock them all out early” and end up facing someone who’s “got some talent.” \n\nHe couldn’t have been too worried: in almost the next sentence, he disparaged Senator Cory Booker, of New Jersey, who is known to have Presidential aspirations. Senators Richard Blumenthal, of Connecticut, and Dianne Feinstein, of California, were his next targets. They may not be running—certainly not Feinstein, who is eighty-five—but they were useful instruments for Trump to turn to what he clearly sees as a selling point for himself and the Republican Party: the confirmation of [Brett Kavanaugh](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/brett-kavanaugh) to the Supreme Court. Both Blumenthal and Feinstein had opposed Kavanaugh, even before [Christine Blasey Ford](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/christine-blasey-ford) came forward with allegations that he had sexually assaulted her when they were teen-agers. (Kavanaugh denied it.) Trump crudely imitated the way in which Feinstein hesitated and turned to an aide when asked about how a letter from Ford had become public. \n\n“Lock her up! Lock her up!” the Iowa-Nebraska crowd began chanting. “I think they’re talking about Feinstein. Can you believe it?” Trump said, with apparent pleasure. The crime that would merit her locking up was left unspecified; her gender, perhaps, and her status as a Trump enemy, appeared to be grounds enough. (There was a lock-her-up round for Hillary Clinton later, lest anyone think that she had been forgotten.)\n\nTrump had, indeed, opened the rally with a reference to Kavanaugh, praising Iowa’s Senator Chuck Grassley, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee—“a very tough cookie”—for his role in the victory. But, again, Iowa wasn’t the point; Kavanaugh barely was. “They wanted to destroy that man—because they wanted to destroy me, too,” Trump said. There was no implied hashtag in front of his “me, too” phrase; it wasn’t even particularly a note of sympathy for or solidarity with Kavanaugh. It was, rather, an injunction to remember that Trump was the measure of all things. And Trump could understand how Trump would become a target. But Kavanaugh? “How could you do that?”\n\nTrump had an answer. It didn’t have to do with Kavanaugh’s extreme judicial positions, or with what appeared to be lies at certain points in his testimony, or with the substance of the serious allegations against him. Instead, Trump offered an anthem for the midterms and beyond: “In their lust for power, the Democrats have become totally unhinged. They’ve gone, they’ve gone crazy. No: *they’ve gone crazy*.” \n\nThere was more, a few minutes later: “You don’t hand matches to an arsonist, and you don’t give power to an angry, left-wing mob. And that’s what the Democrats have become. They would turn our country so fast into Venezuela, and Venezuela’s not doing too well, folks.” There was more mimicry, as he asked the crowd to imagine him asking Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters for the money to build his southern-border wall, and the two of them turning him down. Pelosi will likely be the Speaker if the Democrats take back the House; Trump [likes to deride](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1011295779422695424) Waters, who is African-American, as “low IQ.” \n\nBut he was doing great, he told the people in Council Bluffs, and they were doing great. The Democrats, though, want to “reverse our amazing progress, and plunge our country into gridlock, frankly into poverty, ultimately into chaos—that’s what’s going to happen.” And yet, in a contradiction that he did not acknowledge, given his party’s attacks on the Affordable Care Act, one of the things he promised was to “always protect Americans with preëxisting conditions.” \n\n \n\n“The Democrat agenda is socialism and open borders,” Trump said, at another point. If the Democrats prevailed in the next election they would turn America “into a giant sanctuary for criminal aliens and the MS-13 killers that we’re getting out of the country, by the way, by the thousands.” He then repeated a baseless claim he has made before about MS-13 taking over whole towns on Long Island, which then had to be “liberated.” “It could happen to your community,” Trump warned the crowd.\n\nTrump has scare tactics and appeals to bigotry to offer voters. It is a fair question, though, to ask [what the Democrats have](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/10/01/do-the-democrats-have-a-post-kavanaugh-post-midterm-game-plan), in terms of a clear message for 2020\\. (They will, for example, need a more coherent position on immigration, which includes whether the Party’s national platform is, indeed, to abolish *ICE*{:.small}.) “How do you beat us in 2020?” Trump asked in Iowa, posing a question that the crowd took rhetorically, but Democrats should not. “Those debates I’m looking forward to.” \n\nBut first, the midterms. Trump invited Kim Reynolds, the Republican governor of Iowa—who is up for reëlection, in a race seen as a tossup—to the microphone. “Thank you for standing strong with Justice Kavanaugh, and appointing conservative judges to the court!” she began. “Wow! Good energy!” Trump said when she was done, pleased, perhaps, with the affirmation that Kavanaugh was a good cudgel in a campaign that he wanted to be based in terms of resentment and bitterness. He then attacked Reynolds’s Democratic opponent, saying, “What I’m giving you he will take.”\n\nBut no one, as far as Trump was concerned, would be taking back Kavanaugh. “Last week, they’re saying ‘impeach,’&amp;nbsp;” Trump said, referring to murmurings among some Democrats about whether Kavanaugh, having been confirmed, might be removed from the Court. Doing so would be an extreme and, realistically, improvident move, risking chaos and swings on the Court for decades to come, which may be why Trump likes talking about it. “Impeach him for what? For what?” he said. “Besides that, I have to go first”—an odd reference to the threat of his own impeachment. Maybe that was just a reminder that he might still get to appoint more judges. And maybe it was a dare.","rubric":"","socialTitle":"Trump’s Message for 2020: the Democrats Are a “Wacko” Mob","socialDescription":"“In their lust for power, the Democrats have become totally unhinged,” Trump said at a rally this week.","seoTitle":"Trump’s Message for 2020: the Democrats Are a “Wacko” Mob","seoDescription":"Amy Davidson Sorkin on how President Donald Trump’s message to supporters at a rally in Council Bluffs, Iowa, this week could become a campaign anthem for the 2018 elections and beyond.","channel":"","subChannel":"","issueDate":"","ledeCaption":"","contentSource":"web","canonicalUrl":"","contentType":"","textMimeType":"","tags":["Donald Trump","Midterm Elections","Republican Party","Brett Kavanaugh"],"interactiveOverride":"","revisionAuthor":"David Muto","meta":{"collectionName":"articles","modelName":"article","publishable":true,"identifiable":true,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":true,"hierarchical":false},"id":"5bbe62ef6b3a9e2ce9a74e41","revision":18,"createdAt":"2018-10-10T20:37:03.391Z","modifiedAt":"2018-10-11T18:06:08.905Z","revisionCreatedAt":"2018-10-11T18:06:08.905Z","_embedded":{"contributorsAuthor":[{"fields":{"name":"Amy Davidson Sorkin","title":"Amy Davidson Sorkin, a _New Yorker_ staff writer, is a regular contributor to Comment for the magazine and writes a Web [column](http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson), in which she covers war, sports, and everything in between.","email":"","socialMedia":[],"canonicalUrl":"http://www.newyorker.com/contributors/amy-davidson-sorkin","bio":"Amy Davidson Sorkin became a staff writer in 2014.

A white clerk tells him that he will first have to read aloud a paragraph from the Constitution. When he easily does so, the clerk says that he will also have to read and translate a section written in Spanish. Again he complies. The clerk then demands that he read sections in French, German, and Russian, all of which he happens to speak fluently. Finally, the clerk shows him a passage in Arabic. The professor looks at it and says, “My Arabic is rusty, but I believe this translates to ‘Negroes cannot vote in this county.’ ”\n\nOld jokes have lately been finding renewed salience. Literacy tests, poll taxes, and grandfather clauses, once the most common mechanisms for disadvantaging minority voters, have been consigned to the history books, but one need look no further than the governor’s race in Georgia to see their modern equivalents in action. The race between the Republican, Brian Kemp, Georgia’s secretary of state, and the Democrat, Stacey Abrams, the former minority leader of the state House of Representatives—who, if she wins, will be the first black female governor in the country—is a virtual tie. But Kemp has invoked the so-called exact-match law to suspend fifty-three thousand voter-registration applications, for infractions as minor as a hyphen missing from a surname. African-Americans make up thirty-two per cent of the state’s population, but they represent nearly seventy per cent of the suspended applications. Kemp’s move is particularly questionable given that Abrams’s electoral strategy hinges on mobilizing the six hundred thousand unregistered black voters who have long been seen as the holy grail of Democratic politics in the state.\n\nKemp’s acts are singled out for scrutiny in “One Person, No Vote,” a book about modern-day voter suppression, by the historian Carol Anderson. In 2012, after the Asian American Legal Advocacy Center, in Atlanta, discovered that many of its clients who were naturalized citizens were not on the voter rolls, despite having registered, the group raised the issue with Kemp’s office. “In a show of raw intimidation,” Anderson writes, “Kemp ordered an investigation questioning the methods that the organization had used to register new voters.” In 2014, Kemp investigated the New Georgia Project, a voter-registration initiative that Abrams had founded. In a similar vein, officials in Jefferson County last week ordered a group of African-American senior citizens off a bus taking them to an early-voting site, on the ground that the transportation, which had been organized by the nonpartisan group Black Voters Matter, was a “political activity.”\n\nThe events in Georgia are part of a broader political project. The xenophobia and the resentment that Donald Trump stirred up during the 2016 election are fundamentally concerns about the future of the American electorate. (His reported comment that too many people are immigrating from “shithole countries” in Africa and the Caribbean was paired with a lament that not enough are coming from Europe.) He has repeatedly stated that he lost the popular vote because non-citizens voted for Hillary Clinton. Last Thursday, at a rally in Montana, he suggested that Democrats were responsible for a caravan of migrants now heading north from Honduras, because they “figure everybody coming in is going to vote Democrat.” Kemp, likewise, claimed that Abrams wants to let undocumented people vote in Georgia. The suppression of minority votes is the homegrown corollary of this strategy—an attempt to place a white thumb on the demographic scale.\n\nAccording to the Brennan Center for Justice, ninety-nine bills designed to diminish voter access were introduced last year in thirty-one state legislatures. Many of the recent Republican-led efforts stem from the Supreme Court’s 2013 decision in Shelby v. Holder. In an opinion that eviscerated the Voting Rights Act of 1965, Chief Justice John Roberts wrote that discrimination still exists, but not sufficiently to warrant the “extraordinary” remediation measures that the act imposed on the states of the former Confederacy. That argument is roughly equivalent to saying that a decline in the prevalence of an infectious disease means that we should stop vaccinating against it. Within hours of the decision, Texas announced a strict new voter-I.D. law. Mississippi and Alabama shortly afterward began enforcing similar laws that previously had been barred.\n\nThe decision added a layer of severity to a voter-access crisis precipitated by state laws that prohibit six million Americans with past convictions from voting. In three Southern states—Florida, Tennessee, and Kentucky—this means that at least twenty per cent of eligible-age African-Americans cannot vote. Meanwhile, North Carolina enacted restrictions on early voting, a policy that particularly affects African-Americans, who are likely to be hourly-wage workers and cannot always get to the polls on Election Day. Last year, the Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal to reinstate a voter-I.D. law in North Carolina that a federal court had found targeted black voters “with almost surgical precision.” In effect, the question posed by Roberts’s ruling is how much discrimination there has to be before you can justify protecting voters.\n\nIronically, though, a number of the recent laws validate Roberts’s argument about the undue burden that the Voting Rights Act put on the South; complaints have been lodged in several states that fought for the Union, such as Ohio, Wisconsin, Indiana, and Iowa, which have passed strict voter-I.D. or roll-purge laws. Earlier this year, in Kansas, a federal judge struck down a law that required voters to provide proof of citizenship to register, championed by Kris Kobach, the secretary of state, who served as a vice-chair of Donald Trump’s short-lived voter-fraud commission and is now running for governor. In North Dakota, which didn’t become a state until twenty-four years after the Civil War, Native Americans must now provide an I.D. that shows a street address—even though many have only a P.O. box.\n\nThe midterm elections are in two weeks. The results will be read as a referendum primarily on Trump’s Presidency, but also on the effectiveness of the electoral restrictions. The old punch line has changed: a professor fluent in five languages no longer need travel south to encounter voter suppression. Voter access is not just a regional crisis; it is a national one. ♦","hed":"Not Every Vote Counts","issueDate":"October 29, 2018","tags":["Voting","Georgia","Brian Kemp","African-Americans","Voting Rights","Voter Suppression","category_news","\"One Person, One Vote\"","Carol Anderson","Asian American Legal Advocacy Center","New Georgia Project","Black Votes Matter","Shelby v.

gauche, reality-TV-worthy lark, [Donald Trump](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump)’s political career has trafficked—profitably—in spectacle. The risqué language of his rhetoric, the belligerent fervor of the campaign rallies that he holds even two years after the election, the malign charisma that he exudes—all this was in pursuit of a cynical principle that he has organized his life and, now, the nation’s politics around. Selfless service is no longer the most esteemed virtue of democracy; celebrity is. It’s for this reason that the image of a *MAGA*{: .small}-hatted Kanye West, seated, on Thursday, in front of the Resolute Desk and blacksplaining the evils of the Democratic Party, while Trump nodded along, felt less surreal than it should have. Rather, it seemed a logical turn of events in a cosmos capable of granting Donald Trump [three hundred and four votes](https://transition.fec.gov/pubrec/fe2016/federalelections2016.pdf#page=11) in the Electoral College. Surrealism only works when there is a stable reference for reality.\n\nAs part of a ten-minute logorrhea jaunt in the Oval Office, West oddly admitted that he saw Trump as a reference point for his own masculinity, and that he derived superpowers from his red Make America Great Again hat. To the extent that it matters—and, in the marketplace of spectacle, it does not matter much—West is not a conservative; he’s a contrarian. (The same can be said of Trump.) An actual commitment to conservatism would require more stringently analytical or, at least, consistent thinking than West has demonstrated since he started his *MAGA*{: .small} spree, earlier this year. It’s not uncommon for men unburdened by rigorous thinking but convinced of the superiority of their intellects to presume that a minority opinion is the most valid one. As they see it, a rarity among men must certainly hold the least common of world views. It is not uncommon for people to support Donald Trump, as the rallies that he presides over indicate. But it *is* uncommon for black men, eighty-two per cent of whom voted for Hillary Clinton, to support him. It is safe to assume that Trump’s support among middle-aged rappers is at least as meagre. This conflation of élitism with unpopular ideas is a trait that Trump and West share. Trump’s most absurd and wrongheaded ideas, from birtherism to trade protectionism, are connected by the fact that they were thought to be ridiculous by people whom he sees as his intellectual inferiors—not, like him, a genius. \n\nThe Trump Presidency is an animate example of what happens when the term “for argument’s sake” becomes an actual political ideology. Trump’s élitist contrarianism has been able to masquerade as conservatism, in part, because it exists explicitly in opposition to everything that the liberal Barack Obama stood for. Trump is not a Republican; he’s whatever is the opposite of a black Democrat who became President. This is why Trump was no doubt particularly gratified to hear West, a once favored son of Chicago, the city that gave Obama his political foundations, mouthing the right-wing talking point that violence in Chicago is a product of the Democratic Party’s failures. Homicide, West said, is a product of the Democratic welfare state, which destroyed black families. It’s worth pointing out that Trump has consistently drafted black celebrities—not elected officials, scholars, or policy analysts—into his discussions of African-American interests. (The N.F.L.-great-turned-activist Jim Brown accompanied West to the White House for what was supposed to have been a discussion of economic development, policing, and public policy.)\n\nThe discussion of Chicago, or, rather, the Chicago that is the fictive jungle of Trump’s pronouncements, illustrates precisely why it is dangerous to substitute impulse and connotation for thought and analysis. For Trump, Chicago exists as a central reference point for black failure. During the 2016 campaign, he politicized the [death of Nykea Aldridge](https://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/294239-wade-trumps-tweet-left-a-bad-taste-in-my-mouth), the cousin of the N.B.A. star Dwyane Wade, tweeting that her shooting, on the South Side of Chicago, was further evidence that black people would “vote Trump.” Shortly after taking office, Trump tweeted, “If Chicago doesn't fix the horrible ‘carnage’ going on,&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. I will send in the Feds!”—a threat that connoted less a concern about black lives than the partisan opportunities provided by conspicuous black deaths.\n\nAt the Oval Office meeting on Thursday, Trump advocated for the use of stop-and-frisk in Chicago (which, to his credit, West asked him to reconsider), despite the fact that the police department there has been plagued by complaints of excessive use of force, and that, less than a week earlier, the former C.P.D. officer Jason Van Dyke was [convicted of second-degree murder](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/laquanmcdonald/ct-jason-vandyke-laquan-mcdonald-timeline-htmlstory.html) in the shooting death of the seventeen-year-old Laquan McDonald. Trump’s own Attorney General has opposed the federal consent decree that was designed to address the problems in the department. For Trump, the violence in Chicago serves as the perpetual justification for these kinds of abuses. The belief that the violence is the product of a single political party is troublesome when expressed by reactionaries, but an outrageous one when expressed by a black Chicagoan who really ought to know better.\n\nThe roots of Chicago’s violence are complex and trans-partisan, but they exist in the context of a prolifically armed and exceedingly violent country. (White American violence alone would distinguish the United States from its less volatile Western industrial peers.) There is no way to segregate the six hundred and sixty-four murders that took place in Chicago last year from the more than seventeen thousand that occurred in the rest of the United States. The catalysts for violence in that city predate the “welfare state” and the rise of single-parent black households, in the nineteen-seventies. In the classic 1945 text “[Black Metropolis](https://www.amazon.com/Black-Metropolis-Study-Negro-Northern/dp/0226162346)*,*” the sociologists St. Clair Drake and Horace Cayton detailed the ways in which discrimination in housing and employment were negatively affecting black migrants. Twenty-three years before that, the Chicago Commission on Race Relations, formed after a race riot in which thirty-eight people died, found the violence to be a product of the exploding populations in the city’s Black Belt and the poor housing and employment conditions to which the growing number of African-Americans were subjected. (In 1903, W. E. B. Du Bois had lamented the ways in which overcrowding, filth, and discrimination, as well as unchecked vice, had spawned violence within the emerging black communities in Philadelphia.) \n\nTo understand Chicago, we could turn to Richard Wright, whose early work documented the travails of black migrants there. Or to the photographer Gordon Parks, who began his career depicting the living conditions of African-Americans in Chicago. Or to the artist Charles White, whose early work explored similar themes. Or to the poet Gwendolyn Brooks, whose work provided a window into the lives of black Chicagoans. Or to the playwright Lorraine Hansberry, whose “[A Raisin in the Sun](https://www.amazon.com/Raisin-Sun-Modern-Classics/dp/0413762408)” was partly inspired by her own family’s fight against racially restrictive housing covenants in the Chicago area. At one time, it would have been possible to turn to Kanye West for insight into such matters. \n\nBut you cannot turn to Donald Trump to understand Chicago, because you would then be trading presumptions instead of ideas, and putting empty placeholders where reflection and analysis belong—a known formula for idiocy. And if, by chance, one finds oneself, like Kanye, engaged in such clownery with the President of the United States, it should be recalled that idiocy is the one exception in life where it is always better to be useless than to be damned by one’s usefulness. ","rubric":"","socialTitle":"Kanye West, Donald Trump, and the Truth About Chicago","socialDescription":"The belief that the violence in Chicago is the product of a single political party is troublesome when expressed by reactionaries, but an outrageous one when expressed by a black Chicagoan who ought to know better.","seoTitle":"Kanye West, Donald Trump, and the Truth About Chicago","seoDescription":"Jelani Cobb writes about the rapper Kanye West’s visit to President Donald Trump in the White House and the perpetuation of the erroneous assumption that the city of Chicago owes its problem of violence to the creation by the Democratic Party of a welfare state in the city.","channel":"","subChannel":"","issueDate":"","ledeCaption":"","contentSource":"web","canonicalUrl":"","contentType":"","textMimeType":"","tags":["Donald Trump","Kanye West","Chicago","Violence","Racial Profiling"],"interactiveOverride":"","revisionAuthor":"Carlos Colomer","meta":{"collectionName":"articles","modelName":"article","publishable":true,"identifiable":true,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":true,"hierarchical":false},"id":"5bc2244dd942102d81c0f6db","revision":12,"createdAt":"2018-10-13T16:58:53.597Z","modifiedAt":"2018-10-13T23:57:40.080Z","revisionCreatedAt":"2018-10-13T23:57:40.080Z","_embedded":{"contributorsAuthor":[{"fields":{"name":"Jelani Cobb","title":"Jelani Cobb is a staff writer at *The New Yorker* and the author of “[The Substance of Hope: Barack Obama and the Paradox of Progress](https://www.amazon.com/dp/080271739X/?tag=thneyo0f-20).”","email":"","socialMedia":[{"network":"Twitter","handle":"jelani9"}],"canonicalUrl":"http://www.newyorker.com/contributors/jelani-cobb","bio":"Jelani Cobb has been contributing to _The New Yorker_ since 2012, and became a staff writer in 2015.

But a fuller copy of the e-mail correspondence between Ramirez’s legal team and Republican and Democratic Senate staffers shows that a Republican aide declined to proceed with telephone calls and instead repeatedly demanded that Ramirez produce additional evidence in written form. Only then could any conversation about her testimony proceed. The exchange culminated in a breakdown of communication between the two sides, as Republican and Democratic staffers traded accusations of stonewalling.\n\nThe e-mails show that Mike Davis, a senior Republican committee staffer, approached Ramirez’s attorneys on Sunday evening, shortly after *The New Yorker* published a piece about Senate Democrats investigating her [allegation of sexual misconduct by Kavanaugh during their college years](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/senate-democrats-investigate-a-new-allegation-of-sexual-misconduct-from-the-supreme-court-nominee-brett-kavanaughs-college-years-deborah-ramirez). Ramirez told *The New Yorker* that Kavanaugh had exposed himself at a drunken dormitory party, thrust his penis in her face, and caused her to touch it without her consent as she pushed him away. Kavanaugh has repeatedly said that the allegations are false. \n\nFrom the start, Ramirez’s legal team had called for the F.B.I. to conduct an investigation. Her attorney John Clune told Davis that Ramirez was seeking an F.B.I. investigation and said that, “on appropriate terms, she would also agree to be interviewed in person.” But when Clune proposed a phone call several times, Davis repeatedly insisted that Clune answer two questions: Did Ramirez possess evidence in addition to what was in the *New Yorker* article? And was she willing to provide testimony to the committee’s investigators?\n\nClune answered the Republican staffer’s questions, suggesting that Ramirez did, in fact, have additional witnesses and other evidence. And, he said, of Ramirez’s willingness to testify to the committee’s investigators, “We couldn’t answer without learning more from you about the details of whatever process you are contemplating. After hearing more, we would advise the client accordingly.” Davis then requested that Ramirez’s team provide evidence in the form of a letter, e-mail, or statement to the committee’s investigators before he would consider a call. Clune continued to try to schedule a call with a Democratic staffer on the e-mail thread, but Davis wrote back to him, saying that, “before we discuss a phone call or any other next steps, again, we need to have the following information,” and reiterated the two questions. \n\nAt that point, Heather Sawyer, the Democratic staffer who was copied on the e-mails in accordance with committee policy, wrote to Davis, “As you’re aware, Ms. Ramirez’s counsel have repeatedly requested to speak with the Committee, on a bipartisan basis, to determine how to proceed. You refused. I’ve never encountered an instance where the Committee has refused even to speak with an individual or counsel. I am perplexed as to why this is happening here, except that it seems designed to ensure that the Majority can falsely claim that Ms. Ramirez and her lawyers refused to cooperate. That simply is not true.”\n\nDavis responded, “I have not refused to speak with anyone. I am simply requesting – for the __7th time__ now __over the last 48 hours__ – that Ms. Ramirez’s attorneys provide the Senate Judiciary Committee with any __*evidence*{:.underline}__ that they have before we move to the next steps.” (Emphasis in original.) Finally, one of Ramirez’s lawyers sent a formal letter requesting an F.B.I. investigation. The letter said that Ramirez “is willing to cooperate with the Committee,” and that her efforts to do so were being rebuffed. \n\nSawyer did not respond to a request for comment. A Democratic staffer responding on her behalf confirmed that the e-mails were accurate. \n\nDavis did not comment, but he provided a separate personal e-mail sent to one of Ramirez’s attorneys, noting that they were acquaintances and saying, “I look forward to working with you on this matter.” In a statement, a Republican committee aide said, “Our staff proactively reached out to Ms. Ramirez’s attorney just minutes after she went public in the New Yorker, and we did so on a bipartisan basis. As a general practice, the committee requests to review any evidence or statement before determining how best to proceed with an investigation. This is necessary given the sheer volume of claims that the committee receives. Our staff asked on seven separate occasions over the course of 48 hours for any evidence or statement Ms. Ramirez would be willing to provide. Unfortunately, her counsels have not provided the committee with any such material to review.” The aide noted that the committee asked Kavanaugh about the allegation during an interview this week. \n\nRamirez’s attorney, Clune, disputed that description of the committee’s response, saying in a statement that he had responded “quickly and positively” to each of the committee’s inquiries. “Almost immediately in our correspondence, they became less interested in hearing from her and more interested in discovering what witnesses we could bring forward. Since it was only the majority staff that made these demands, as the minority staff questioned those demands as unprecedented, we became suspicious that any disclosures we might file would be shared inappropriately with Judge Kavanaugh or others to prepare and attack Debbie’s account,” Clune wrote. “Since Debbie’s interest was in an F.B.I. investigation where Judge Kavanaugh could be questioned under oath, we didn’t feel comfortable releasing this information without their assurances. We continued to attempt to negotiate in good faith by submitting a lengthier letter providing more information as well as Debbie’s request for investigation. Other than replying ‘received’ on Thursday morning, the committee has not responded. It is remarkable that the committee admits they had enough information to question Judge Kavanaugh under oath on Debbie’s statements in *The New Yorker*, yet that very same information was insufficient for Debbie’s counsel to earn even a phone call.” \n\nFord’s road to testifying was also marked by partisan rancor and allegations of stonewalling by both sides. In an e-mail last week, Ford’s attorney Debra Katz wrote to the committee’s majority staff, saying, “The imposition of aggressive and artificial deadlines regarding the date and conditions of any hearing has created tremendous and unwarranted anxiety and stress on Dr. Ford.” In announcing Ford’s agreement to testify after days of tense exchanges, Katz wrote that “many aspects” of the terms under which she would testify “are fundamentally inconsistent with the Committee’s promise of a fair, impartial investigation into her allegations, and we are disappointed with the leaks and the bullying that have tainted the process.” \n\nBefore Ford testified, Republicans on the Judiciary Committee announced that a vote on Kavanaugh would proceed on Friday. After yesterday’s hearing, Grassley told reporters that the committee would meet on Friday morning for the vote, as planned.\n\n\n\n----------\n\n\n*E-mails exchanged between Ramirez’s legal team and Republican and Democratic Senate staffers obtained by The New Yorker have been reproduced below.

true from the start: Charles and David Koch, who came to be known as “the Koch brothers,” were equals in bloodlines and in wealth, but Charles has always been the brains behind the brothers’ vast corporate and political operations. Those who know the brothers well predict that David’s retirement will have scant impact, particularly in the political realm, where the Kochs exert enormous influence.\n\nFor the past four decades they have tapped their vast fortune from a hundred-and-fifteen-billion-dollar-a-year family business, Koch Industries, to finance a private political machine whose reach and size have been described as rivalling that of the Republican Party. By lavishly underwriting candidates, policy organizations, and advocacy groups—often [through untraceable donations](https://www.newyorker.com/sections/news/can-time-inc-survive-the-kochs)—they have pulled American politics toward their own arch-conservative, pro-business, anti-tax, and anti-regulatory agenda, particularly in the environmental area. Although David Koch is also stepping down from his role as chairman of the Americans for Prosperity Foundation, the foundation wing of the Kochs’ main political-advocacy group, their influence isn’t likely to wane anytime soon.\n\nDavid Koch, who is seventy-eight and the wealthiest resident of Manhattan, is more socially prominent than his older brother. He is often chronicled on the social pages, having donated by his own estimate $1\\.2 billion to philanthropic causes, including many of New York City’s cultural, medical, and educational institutions, several of which bear his name. In contrast, Charles Koch, an eighty-two-year-old libertarian ideologue who continues to live in the brothers’ home town of Wichita, Kansas, has largely stayed outside of the limelight. But those familiar with the brothers suggest that although Charles is less well-known, he, not David, has long been the driving force behind both the phenomenal growth at Koch Industries and the duo’s ambitious political ventures.\n\nCharles also appears to have dominated David’s decision to retire. According to two well-informed individuals close to the family, David, who has been in declining health for several years, had resisted resigning, but Charles forced him out. A business associate who declined to be identified, in order not to jeopardize his ties to the family, told me, “Charles pushed David out. It was done with a wink, and a nod, and a nudge.” A second longtime family associate confirmed this, saying, “Charles had been pushing him out for quite some time. David kept resisting. It was bad. Charles took control.” \n\nThe decision became public on Tuesday, when Charles, who is the chairman and chief executive officer of Koch Industries, sent a letter to employees announcing that David would be retiring as vice-president, a development that he attributed to David’s deteriorating health. “We are deeply saddened by this, as we miss David’s insightful questions and his many contributions to Koch Industries,” Charles’s letter said. The letter didn’t disclose the nature of David’s health problems, but he was diagnosed with prostate cancer twenty-four years ago. Multiple associates say that in the past year or so he had visibly declined, losing weight and losing his train of thought in conversations, as well as occasionally nodding off in meetings and public events. “As a result,” the letter said, “he is unable to be involved in business and other organizational activities.” Charles Koch, meanwhile, continues to work through the weekends, often arriving at Koch Industries’ Wichita headquarters earlier than many other employees. “He’s a workaholic, like Warren Buffet. He lives to work,” the well-informed business associate told me. “It looks like he’s going to be doing this into his nineties.”\n\nIt is unclear, however, what will become of David’s ownership of nearly half of Koch Industries, the second-largest private company in the country, which began as oil refineries and pipelines, and has grown into a multinational conglomerate encompassing lumber, paper, chemicals, coal, fertilizer, and sophisticated financial-trading operations. Because the company is private, there is minimal transparency. But Charles and David Koch reportedly own virtually all of its stock, splitting the shares equally among themselves and plowing most of the profits back into the company. *Forbes* magazine estimates that each brother is worth approximately sixty billion dollars, tying them as America’s ninth-richest men. Steve Lombardo, Koch Industries’ chief of corporate communications, did not respond to questions about who would exercise control of David’s shares, should he prove unable to function. David has three children, the oldest of whom is college-aged. Charles has two children, including a son, Chase Koch, who has assumed a growing role in running the company.\n\nThe Kochs’ future prospects are of public interest because of the oversized influence they have exerted in American politics. Beginning in the late nineteen-seventies, the brothers became the primary underwriters of hard-line libertarianism in the country. From the start, though, Charles was the instigator behind their political activism while remaining largely behind the scenes. This dynamic was evident as far back as 1980, when Charles convinced his younger brother David to run for Vice-President on the Libertarian Party ticket. The brothers regarded Ronald Reagan, who was running for President that year, as too liberal. The Libertarian platform called for abolishing all federal income taxes and virtually every federal agency, including the I.R.S., the F.B.I., the C.I.A., the F.E.C., the E.P.A., the F.D.A., and the S.E.C. The party also opposed Medicaid, Medicare, Social Security, public education, and minimum-wage and child-labor laws. Charles and David, former  members of the John Birch Society, which their father, Fred, helped found, regarded centralized government as a scourge akin to Communism. At the time, however, such views were considered kooky even by most conservatives. The conservative stalwart William F. Buckley, Jr., called the Kochs’ views “Anarcho-Totalitarianism.” The voters’ verdict was equally harsh. David spent two million dollars of his own money on his candidacy in 1980, but he was trounced. The Libertarian Party earned only one per cent of the vote.\n\nAfterward, Charles told a reporter that he had grown disillusioned with conventional electoral politics but had not given up his quest to advance libertarianism. “Politics,” he told a reporter, “tends to be a nasty, corrupting business.” His interest, he said, is “in advancing libertarian ideas.” Instead of just funding candidates, Charles set out to subsidize an ideology. He aimed to change the way Americans thought by creating and funding an interlocking array of libertarian think tanks, advocacy groups, and academic, legal, and other organizations. Even two years before his brother’s Presidential run, Charles declared, “Our movement must destroy the prevalent statist paradigm.”\n\nNearly forty years later, many of the Kochs’ policy preferences are now standard Republican orthodoxy, having been promoted from the fringes into the mainstream by the dozens of nonprofit organizations and candidates they funded. Small government, anti-tax, anti-regulatory, and pro-privatization policies, as well as skepticism regarding global warming, are commonplace. \n\nAfter his 1980 bid for office, David Koch continued to be the more visible of the brothers. He spoke at Americans for Prosperity events and made head-turning political donations. But most of the planning for the Kochs’ political takeover was done by Charles Koch, various sources close to the process told me. It was Charles Koch, for instance, who came up with the idea, in 2003, of pooling political donations with like-minded wealthy conservatives, creating a huge, centrally controlled war chest for what is, in essence, a conservative millionaires’ movement. There are now some seven hundred members of this exclusive club, which meets twice a year at Charles’s invitation and calls itself the Seminar Network. Each member commits to donate a minimum of a hundred thousand dollars, and some donate millions. “David liked to rub shoulders with the other big donors, and to make large donations,” the well-informed business associate told me, “and so that part may now change. But Charles really runs the bus. Only when Charles goes will everything change.”\n\nThe election of Donald Trump, the single Republican Presidential candidate whom they had openly opposed, seemed to some to sideline the brothers. Charles had memorably described the choice between Trump and Hillary Clinton as like one between “cancer or a heart attack.” But while the Kochs didn’t get the candidate they wanted, under Trump they have nonetheless gotten many of the policies they wanted. Political allies, many of whom have have been subsidized by the Kochs in one way or another in the past, now fill numerous key Trump Cabinet and administrative posts.  \n\nAt the E.P.A. and the Interior Department, for instance, two government agencies that are vital to the profit levels of Koch Industries, top personnel have deep ties to the Kochs. The career of the E.P.A. administrator, Scott Pruitt, in Oklahoma politics was financially supported by the Kochs. Daniel Jorjani, now the acting solicitor in the Interior Department, formerly worked for Freedom Partners, the Kochs’ political-funding group, and at the Charles Koch Institute and Charles Koch Foundation. Dozens of other key Koch-affiliated personnel encircle Trump, including Marc Short, the congressional liaison in the Trump White House; Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who received backing from the Kochs  as a businessman and a congressman from Wichita; Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, who was a billionaire donor in the Kochs’ Seminar Network; and Vice-President Mike Pence, whose financial ties to the Kochs run so deep, the former Trump White House strategist Steve Bannon told me, that he worried that if Pence were ever elected “he’d be a President that the Kochs would own.”\n\nRecent news accounts have highlighted differences that the Kochs have had with Trump, including their plans to spend heavily against Trump’s imposition of tariffs on imports, and their opposition to Trump’s restrictive immigration policies. Some cite these fissures as evidence  that the Kochs are changing or moderating their views. Frank Baxter, a longtime donor to the Kochs’ political operation, told the [Washington *Post*](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/david-koch-steps-down-from-influential-conservative-network-he-helmed-with-his-brother/2018/06/05/aedeae68-68d6-11e8-bf8c-f9ed2e672adf_story.html) that the Koch network was “evolving.” But the Kochs have long favored free trade and minimal immigration barriers, both of which are consistent with their free-market beliefs, and also boost the profits of their multinational corporation. What has been evolving is merely their messaging, which casts their industry-friendly immigration and trade stances in terms of helping Dreamers and protecting low-income consumers.\n\nWhat is often overlooked, and is far more significant, is the large extent to which the Kochs’ policy preferences have prevailed under Trump. Trump’s only major legislative achievement, the tax bill, which reduced corporate taxes from thirty-five to twenty-one per cent, was passed with the support of a twenty-million-dollar campaign by Americans for Prosperity, the Kochs’ nationwide advocacy group. At the same time, the Kochs launched an equally effective political campaign to defeat the mechanism that Trump originally embraced to pay for these enormous tax cuts: a “border adjustment tax” devised by Republican Speaker of the House, Paul Ryan. Despite support from the White House and Republican leaders in Congress, the Koch network killed it. The final tax bill redistributed wealth from the bottom and the middle to the top and created gaping deficits that will likely require additional cuts in government spending, positions the Kochs have long embraced.\n\nTrump’s rollback of the Obama Administration’s environmental policies, crippling of Obamacare, and dismantling of key provisions in the Dodd-Frank financial-services law all have been top items on the Kochs’ wish list. There is no sign that David Koch’s departure from public life will significantly affect  any of this. The Kochs’ Seminar Network is promising to spend an estimated three to four hundred  million dollars  during the this fall’s midterm election. Evidently, even if there is only one Koch brother left at the table, the menu will remain exactly the same, and the tab will be larger than ever.","rubric":"","socialTitle":"One Koch Brother Forces the Other Out of the Family Business","socialDescription":"One less billionaire, but more political clout than ever.","seoTitle":"One Koch Brother Forces the Other Out of the Family Business","seoDescription":"Jane Mayer writes about David Koch’s retirement from Koch industries.

The “season of hell” that he promised to inflict on establishment Republicans, when he was exiled from the White House last summer, never materialized, and in ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/midterms-2018"},"the midterm elections"]," there is no substantial Bannonite faction on the ballot. This week, the Hillsborough County Republican Party, in Florida, had to slash the prices of V.I.P. tickets to a fund-raiser featuring Bannon (from a thousand dollars to three hundred dollars to free) because there was so little interest. On Monday night, Bannon spoke in Staten Island to an audience of just more than three dozen people."],["p","And yet, even as he has become a mocked, marginal figure, it doesn’t seem like Bannon is finished. Conservative politicians around the globe—",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/as-jair-bolsonaro-heads-for-a-second-round-vote-fears-rise-over-whats-next-for-brazil"},"Jair Bolsonaro"],", in Brazil, being the latest example—continue to deploy the language of populist authoritarianism, which Bannon has done as much as anyone to elaborate in recent years. More significant, his onetime protégé, ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump"},"the President of the United States"],", has begun to echo Bannon even more explicitly. “I’m a nationalist, O.K.?” Trump said at a Houston rally on Tuesday night, to a hearty roar. “Radical Democrats,” he lamented, wanted to turn power over to “globalists.” Not him. The term “nationalist” has become “old-fashioned,” a word that “we’re not supposed to use,” Trump said. “I’m a nationalist. ",["em","Nationalist"],". Use that word.” That evening on Staten Island, Bannon was gleeful, playing audio of Trump’s monologue to a NY1 reporter who was on the scene. He still had a throne, however diminished: the man with the last big idea in politics."],["p","Everyone invested in American politics is waiting right now—for the midterm elections, for the Mueller investigation (presently operating on mute, in deference to the coming vote), and, lately, for the arrival of ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/why-the-trump-white-house-is-having-a-meltdown-over-the-migrant-caravan"},"a caravan"]," of thousands of Central American migrants, whose ambition to cross the southern border of the United States has been a target of Trump’s hardening rhetoric. The anxieties of 2016 have been revived, namely that, in contrast to the epochal sweep of Trumpism, Democrats are offering only small-bore solutions, and that on the pivotal matter of the southern border liberals are leading with a moral preference for open borders that no significant Democratic politician is willing to embrace. “If liberals insist that only fascists will defend borders, then voters will hire fascists to do the job liberals will not do,” David Frum warned this week, in ",["em","The Atlantic"],"."],["inline-embed",{"type":"callout","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22callout%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22inset-right%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22externallink%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522externallink%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%2522%252Fexternallinks%252F5b5e119292497e4fd00180ea%2522%252C%2522width%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522height%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522caption%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%225b5e119292497e4fd00180ea%5C%22%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%22%2C%22attrs%22%3A%7B%7D%7D","ref":""},["inline-embed",{"type":"externallink","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22externallink%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22%2Fexternallinks%2F5b5e119292497e4fd00180ea%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":"5b5e119292497e4fd00180ea"}]],["p","The charge from anti-Trump conservatives is that, in the face of an authoritarian menace, Democrats have been curiously passive and depressingly small-minded. “A quick glance at actual history shows that it doesn’t have a ‘right side’ where the Democrats can dwell,” Megan McArdle wrote, in the Washington ",["em","Post"],", this month. “It doesn’t mechanically hand out power to the morally superior, or to the smartest, or to those with the best manners.” David Brooks, in the ",["em","Times"],", noted the Democrats’ focus, in the midterms, on preserving health-care coverage (Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi insisted in a joint memo this week that they would remain focussed on the issue “like a laser”) and pronounced it “inadequate to the current moment.” Brooks went on, “It offers no counternarrative to Trump, little moral case against his behavior, no unifying argument against ethnic nationalism. In politics you can’t beat something with nothing.” Bannon supplied Trump with a theory without a plan, the argument goes, but the Democrats have a plan without a theory."],["p","Is that true? I’m not so sure. At least, it seems hard to argue that Democrats have undersold the stakes of elections after Trump. “Our democracy is at stake,” Barack Obama, the most prominent and famously even-tempered Democrat, said in October, 2017, during the Virginia governor’s race. Obama has been making similar remarks for much of the past year, as he has toured the country. “This is the most important election of my lifetime, and that includes the ones where I was on the ballot,” he said in Las Vegas this week. He dispensed a shout-out to the Democratic candidate for lieutenant governor and reminded the crowd of the country’s changing demographics. “Who doesn’t love J Balvin and reggaeton?” he asked. Then he got down to business. What Democrats are up against this time is not just conservatism, he said, “but a vision that says we’re going to protect our power no matter what.”"],["p","Obama doesn’t represent the entirety of the liberal imagination, but he is a reliable guide to it—more reliable, at least, than a strategy memo signed by Schumer and Pelosi. Democrats felt the threat of conservative minority rule during the Obama Administration, in the Koch brothers’ influence on state-level politics and the horror of the Flint water crisis, but it has escalated since the 2016 election, clouded as it was by Russian influence. The Senate’s confirmation of ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/brett-kavanaugh"},"Brett Kavanaugh"]," cemented a conservative majority of five Supreme Court Justices. In ",["em","New York"]," magazine, Jonathan Chait wrote, “It is the culmination of a party increasingly comfortable with, and reliant on, countermajoritarian power.” “It’s official,” Anne Applebaum wrote, in the Washington ",["em","Post"],". “America lives under minority rule.”"],["p","As the midterms near, Democrats have begun to make this theme more explicit. Last week, Joe Biden—if early polls are accurate, the front-runner for the 2020 Presidential nomination—was asked about the discovery that ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/10/29/voter-suppression-tactics-in-the-age-of-trump"},"thousands of Georgians had been removed from the voter rolls"],", under the direction of Georgia’s secretary of state, the Republican Brian Kemp. “That’s right. And seventy per cent of them are African-American. Surprise, surprise!” Biden said. He was asked if this was a pattern of voter suppression. “Absolutely. Positively. Without question,” Biden said. In Florida and Michigan, Democrats have backed ballot measures to restore voting rights to felons; in Utah and Pennsylvania, they have championed efforts to make redistricting nonpartisan. The situation has become especially poignant ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/10/29/voter-suppression-tactics-in-the-age-of-trump"},"in Georgia’s gubernatorial race"],", in which the Democratic candidate, ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/news/current/the-georgia-race-between-stacey-abrams-and-brian-kemp-deserves-a-real-debate"},"Stacey Abrams"],", would become the country’s first black female governor. Kemp, the Republican candidate, has championed strict voter-identification laws. “A pattern of suppression,” Abrams called it. Her ally Nse Ufot, of the New Georgia Project, went further. “In a lot of ways,” she said, “this is Jim Crow’s last stand.”"],["p","Two years after the 2016 election, the limits of Bannonism have become clearer. Though it suggested a governing strategy, Bannon’s revolution, in truth, had a self-detonating quality: once Trump won, his supporters were no longer forgotten men and women. The present Democratic movement has some of the same features. The campaign against minority rule could lead to an anti-oligarchic governing strategy, as Elizabeth Warren might prefer. But its clearest expression is in the campaigns. Elections this year will likely hinge on the matter of who gets to vote and who doesn’t, but they will also be about the imperfections of our democracy. The midterms are a concise test—of the idea’s validity as well as political power. If the Democrats are sure that they represent a suppressed majority, then they have a chance to make that clear on November 6th."]]],"canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"sections":[{"id":"5904126172dadf5d0a508800","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news","children":[{"id":"59ef6620c6604764e97c762c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"59ef6620c6604764e97c762c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Our Columnists","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"our-columnists"},{"id":"5904126172dadf5d0a508800","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news"},{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"}],"name":"Our Columnists","parent":[{"id":"5904126172dadf5d0a508800","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"},"slug":"our-columnists"}]}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"web","contributors":[{"name":"Benjamin Wallace-Wells","type":"author","title":"Benjamin Wallace-Wells began contributing to \u003cem&gt;The New Yorker\u003c/em&gt; in 2006, and joined the magazine as a staff writer in 2015.

Of those last claims, even Fox News has seen fit to ",["a",{"href":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uuKw8Eq8RA"},"fact-check"]," Trump and point out that his statements are unfounded.

More insidiously, writers have adopted the word “deter” and its derivatives.

Back in the early summer, at the height of the media’s attention to the ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/border-crisis"},"separation of children from their families at the southern border"],", I was on an MSNBC show when the host, Ayman Mohyeldin, asked me if the tactic was serving the Trump Administration’s declared purpose of “deterring” asylum seekers. I responded that the question was immoral and should not be posed. Mohyeldin acknowledged my point. Then he followed up: “But is it?”"],["p","A quick survey of mainstream-media coverage shows that, with some ",["a",{"href":"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-deportation-idUSKCN0Y429P"},"exceptions"],", before 2017 the words “migrants” and “asylum” and “deterrent” appeared primarily in coverage of foreign countries. Denmark was trying to “deter” Syrian refugees from approaching its borders. Australia used the word “deterrence” a lot. Indeed, the Australian far right, aided mightily by Rupert Murdoch’s media outlets, got about a decade’s head start on its American counterpart in this method of talking about asylum seekers. The word “deterrence” comes from the language of crime prevention, and its use reinforces the view of asylum seekers as criminals."],["p","These days, MSNBC is asking “",["a",{"href":"http://www.msnbc.com/stephanie-ruhle/watch/trump-administration-threatens-military-response-to-migrant-caravan-1350048835749?v=railb&amp;"},"whether anything will deter these people"],".” Brian Stelter, of CNN, has taken to Twitter to exhort the news media ",["a",{"href":"https://twitter.com/brianstelter/status/1054753355237478400"},"to show the location of the procession on a map"],", demonstrating that it is still many hundreds of miles from the U.S. border. His argument seems to be that the pro-Trump media is overestimating the immediate danger posed by the asylum seekers by minimizing the distance they still have to traverse, as if the people seeking refuge were an advancing army, or a natural disaster. By implication, he and Trump do not disagree about whether the caravan presents a threat, only about its current potency."],["p","But the people walking through Mexico right now are not an army or a hurricane. They are not even planning to cross the border illegally. International law guarantees their right to seek asylum. The U.S. has an obligation to consider their claims. Trump does not have a moral or legal leg to stand on when he talks about deterring the asylum seekers, much less when he promises to send the military to stop them. But most of the media, across the political spectrum, is standing right there with him. They may be mortified by some of the language that Trump uses in discussing immigration, but he has still succeeded in shifting their frame. They are being more polite than the President, but by discussing the effectiveness of “deterrence” and the immediacy of the caravan’s danger, they reinforce his politics of hatred and fear-mongering."]]],"canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"sections":[{"id":"5904126172dadf5d0a508800","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news","children":[{"id":"59ef6620c6604764e97c762c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"59ef6620c6604764e97c762c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Our Columnists","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"our-columnists"},{"id":"5904126172dadf5d0a508800","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news"},{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"}],"name":"Our Columnists","parent":[{"id":"5904126172dadf5d0a508800","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"},"slug":"our-columnists"}]}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"web","contributors":[{"name":"Masha Gessen","type":"author","title":"Masha Gessen, a staff writer, has written several books, including, most recently, “\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Future-History-Totalitarianism-Reclaimed-Russia/dp/159463453X/\"&gt;The Future Is History: How Totalitarianism Reclaimed Russia\u003c/a&gt;,” which won the National Book Award in 2017.","email":"","bio":["div",["p","Masha Gessen began contributing to ",["em","The New Yorker"]," in 2014, and became a staff writer in 2017.

years ago, Abbie Arevalo-Herrera and her young daughter Marcela waited with a group of migrants on the south bank of the Rio Grande for the right moment to cross the river and enter the United States. They had left Honduras five weeks earlier, fleeing Arevalo-Herrera’s former common-law husband, who had threatened to kill her. Waiting at the riverbank, Arevalo-Herrera struggled with the fact that it was Marcela’s seventh birthday. She had nothing to give her. A man in the group said, “I’m gonna go and see if I can bring a cake, so we can cut it together,” but he couldn’t make it to the nearby town. Later that night, she recalled, he apologized and said, “I offered you a cake, and I wasn’t able to give it to you.” He took fifty dollars from his pocket and gave it to Arevalo-Herrera for Marcela. Soon afterward, Arevalo-Herrera and her daughter crossed the river, and were apprehended by U.S. Border Patrol agents and brought to a processing station in McAllen, Texas."],["p","Arevalo-Herrera is petite, not much more than five feet tall, with dark shining eyes and thick black hair. She recently turned thirty-one, but looks much younger. Last month, I met her in an office at the First Unitarian Universalist Church in Richmond, Virginia. She wore an orange short-sleeved T-shirt that read “Happy Halloween.” Her skinny jeans revealed a bulky ankle bracelet that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has required her to wear for the past three years. As we spoke, she periodically rubbed her left forearm—the one that her ex-husband, who is also Marcela’s father, used to grab and twist, she said. It was raining heavily, and the damp, she said, aggravates the pain. (In since-deleted Facebook posts, Abbie’s ex-husband denied abusing her and insisted he was a good father to Marcela.) When she and Marcela were first detained, they were still wet from their river crossing and were placed in a detention center that was so cold from air-conditioning that detainees called it the Icebox. “This reminds me of that place,” Arevalo-Herrera said, smiling and shivering in the church office. She went downstairs and returned wearing a gray hoodie."],["p","Arevalo-Herrera and her family have lived in the basement of the church for the past four months. Marcela, who is now eleven, is a sixth grader at a nearby middle school. Last year, Arevalo-Herrera married Elmer Arita, a legal permanent resident whom she met when they were both working at a local restaurant. They have a two-year-old son, Gabriel, who was born in Virginia and is a U.S. citizen. (At Arevalo-Herrera’s request, pseudonyms are being used for both children in order to protect their safety.) Abbie, Elmer, and Gabriel sleep in a converted religious-education room. Marcela sleeps in an adjoining room, which used to be a storage closet."],["p","Arevalo-Herrera came to the United States hoping to apply for asylum. The fact that she and her family currently live in the church is due, in large part, to a controversial Department of Homeland Security practice by which immigrants are given a “Notice to Appear” in court that bears no date or time.

D.H.S. officials informed her that information about when she had to be in court would be mailed to her there. She and Marcela took a bus to Richmond, where they lived for a time with her relatives. Arevalo-Herrera began working, enrolled Marcela in school, and waited for the notice of her court date. She insists that it never arrived. “I never got any notice,” she told me. On March 10, 2015, she was tried in absentia in an immigration court in Harlingen, and was ordered to leave the country."],["p","For the next three years, Arevalo-Herrera appealed this decision.

Elmer, who works as a roofer, divides his time between the church and a one-bedroom apartment where the family had previously been living together. Arevalo-Herrera and her lawyer hope to find some way to reopen her case. Like tens of thousands of immigrants, the lives of Arevalo-Herrera and her family have been upended by the chaos and the fear generated by the Trump Administration’s immigration policies and the contradictory court rulings that alternately raise and ease their fears of deportation."],["p","On June 21st, Arevalo-Herrera and Kilpatrick received promising news. The Supreme Court, in Pereira v. Sessions, ruled eight to one against Attorney General Jeff Sessions and the Department of Justice in a case involving a Notice to Appear that hewed closely to Arevalo-Herrera’s. In a blistering opinion for the majority, Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote, “A notice that does not inform a noncitizen when and where to appear for removal proceedings is not a ‘notice to appear.’ . . . The plain text, the statutory context, and common sense all lead inescapably and unambiguously to that conclusion.”"],["p","Kilpatrick joined us at the church, and told me that she thought the ruling would have a far-reaching effect on cases in the immigration courts. “The appeals courts may invalidate orders of removal for people like Abbie, who were ordered removed in absentia,” she said. “It’s the hottest issue in immigration law right now.” But, during the past six months, the Trump Administration has created three other, potentially more significant hurdles. Sessions reversed a 2016 decision by the Justice Department’s Board of Immigration Appeals that had made domestic-abuse survivors eligible for asylum. “Generally, claims by aliens pertaining to domestic violence or gang violence perpetrated by nongovernmental actors will not qualify for asylum,” Sessions wrote. “The mere fact that a country may have problems effectively policing certain crimes—such as domestic violence or gang violence cannot itself establish an asylum claim.” He also imposed a quota for immigration judges, requiring them to close seven hundred cases a year. And he ended a requirement that asylum-seekers receive a full hearing before an immigration judge. Now judges can close any cases that they deem unlikely to succeed without hearing

But its methods are still draconian, and, it seems, lucrative: the company also manufactures the ankle bracelets."],["p","After being fitted with her bracelet, in 2015, Arevalo-Herrera was required to check in at ",["em",{"class":"small"},"ISAP"],"’s Richmond office once a week, and to be available for weekly home visits by ",["em",{"class":"small"},"ISAP"]," officers. ",["em",{"class":"small"},"ISAP"]," officials also called her many times a week. When Arevalo-Herrera was pregnant with Gabriel, ",["em",{"class":"small"},"ISAP"]," agents allowed her to remove the bracelet for seven months, but she still had to check in once a week in person. After Gabriel was born, she had to report to the office three days after leaving the hospital. Shortly thereafter, they reinstalled the ankle bracelet, and she has had to wear it ever since."],["p","After she moved into the church, she stopped going to the check-ins, but ",["em",{"class":"small"},"ISAP"]," agents continued to call. “They have some kind of weird schedule between one and four ",["em",{"class":"small"},"A.M."],",” she said. “That’s when they call me. Every single night they call.” She added, “I have my phone right here. I can show you the call logs.” Ostensibly, the ",["em",{"class":"small"},"ISAP"]," agents are checking that she is in the church, but the bracelet has a G.P.S. locator and sounds an alarm if she removes it. The agents know precisely where she is and whether or not she is wearing the bracelet."],["p","During the four months that Arevalo-Herrera and her family have lived in the church, she has grown increasingly uncomfortable with being on the first floor. In an effort to raise awareness about her case, her attorney helped set up a Facebook Live event in which Arevalo-Herrera could answer questions online. The next day, she got a call on her cell phone. “A man said, ‘You fucking woman! You need to pray for your life!’ ” Arevalo-Herrera said, imitating the man’s low drawl. Now she tends to stay in the basement, where there are no windows. “I don’t like coming up here,” she said, as the rain pounded on the skylight above us. Every night, a volunteer, usually a member of the church, sleeps on a mattress in the lobby, to make sure that Arevalo-Herrera and her family are not alone. Volunteers do this in many sanctuary churches across the country, serving as sentries in case anyone, from ",["em",{"class":"small"},"ICE"]," agents to anti-immigrant protesters, might try to enter."],["p","I followed Arevalo-Herrera down a cinder-block stairway to the basement. The church was built in the nineteen-seventies, and at night it has a cold and cavernous feel to it. There is a large open space in the basement, meant for meals and Sunday-school events. Around it there are a handful of small rooms used as classrooms. “We live here,” Arevalo-Herrera said, pointing to a door bearing two signs: one a computer printout that says “PRIVATE”; the other a sign that Marcela wrote in crayon, which reads, “DO NOT! Enter or open the door! Without knocking!”"],["p","Behind the door is one of the small classrooms, which church members converted to a bedroom. Arevalo-Herrera apologized for its messy state. There were toys, books, and a box of diapers on the floor. Two mattresses lay on the gray carpeting. Abbie and Elmer sleep on one, Gabriel sleeps on the other. There is a bathroom down the hall, and the family shares the kitchen with the church staff."],["p","The basement is a busy area, especially on the weekends, and until recently the door to Arevalo-Herrera’s room didn’t lock from the inside. “I can’t lock myself in my room when I’m sleeping,” she told me, before the fix. “No one has ever come in or anything,” she added, “but I still have that fear. It’s always in my mind from my country. No matter where I am, I check the doors.”"]],["inline-embed",{"type":"section","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22section%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cp%3EOn%20the%20night%20I%20visited%2C%20Laura%20Hastings%2C%20a%20soft-spoken%20woman%20in%20her%20fifties%2C%20had%20the%20overnight%20shift%20in%20the%20lobby.%20Wearing%20a%20faded%20green%20T-shirt%2C%20sweatpants%2C%20and%20blue%20sneakers%2C%20she%20sat%20near%20a%20folding%20table%2C%20where%20she%20had%20arranged%20her%20laptop%20and%20a%20bottle%20of%20Coke%20Zero.%20Her%20shift%20was%20from%208%20%3Cem%20class%3D%5C%22small%5C%22%3EP.M%3C%2Fem%3E%20to%207%20%3Cem%20class%3D%5C%22small%5C%22%3EA.M.%3C%2Fem%3E%20%E2%80%9CFrom%20here%2C%20I%20can%20see%20both%20doors%2C%E2%80%9D%20Hastings%20told%20me%2C%20pointing%20to%20the%20church%E2%80%99s%20two%20large%20entryways%2C%20each%20bookended%20by%20a%20pair%20of%20large%20glass%20panes.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EThis%20was%20her%20second%20time%20on%20the%20overnight%20shift.%20%E2%80%9CThe%20first%20time%20was%20remarkably%20uninteresting%2C%E2%80%9D%20she%20said.%20She%20stayed%20up%20for%20a%20few%20hours%2C%20then%20slept%20on%20an%20inflatable%20mattress.%20%E2%80%9CIt%E2%80%99s%20not%20scary%2C%E2%80%9D%20Hastings%20said.%20%E2%80%9CI%E2%80%99m%20used%20to%20being%20here.%E2%80%9D%20After%20the%20church%20put%20a%20Black%20Lives%20Matter%20banner%20out%20front%20a%20few%20years%20ago%2C%20she%20said%2C%20the%20members%20became%20accustomed%20to%20the%20occasional%20objection%20by%20passersby%20or%20people%20online.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EHastings%20is%20part%20of%20what%20the%20church%20calls%20a%20%E2%80%9Cpod%E2%80%9D%E2%80%94a%20group%20of%20volunteers%20who%20can%20be%20called%20upon%20to%20perform%20various%20duties%2C%20such%20as%20sleeping%20in%20the%20lobby%2C%20or%20getting%20food%20for%20the%20family%2C%20or%20taking%20the%20children%20where%20they%20need%20to%20go.%20Hastings%2C%20who%20works%20in%20I.T.%2C%20was%20raised%20as%20a%20Southern%20Baptist%20in%20South%20Carolina%3B%20her%20mother%20was%20a%20Democrat%20and%20father%20a%20Republican.%20In%20the%20past%20few%20years%2C%20she%20said%2C%20she%E2%80%99s%20been%20dismayed%20by%20the%20rise%20of%20white-supremacist%20rhetoric%20and%20behavior%20tied%20to%20the%20election%20of%20Donald%20Trump.%20%E2%80%9CI%20think%20it%20gave%20it%20sort%20of%20an%20approval%20that%20it%20didn%E2%80%99t%20have%20before%2C%E2%80%9D%20she%20said.%20%E2%80%9CIt%E2%80%99s%20gotten%20decidedly%20more%2C%E2%80%9D%20she%20paused%20for%20a%20minute%20and%20looked%20toward%20the%20door%2C%20%E2%80%9Cconfrontational%20is%20the%20word%20I%20would%20use.%20People%20seem%20to%20want%20to%20put%20immigrants%20in%20a%20group%20of%20%E2%80%98other%E2%80%99%E2%80%94not%20part%20of%20this%20country.%20It%E2%80%99s%20sad.%E2%80%9D%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22callout%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522callout%2522%252C%2522name%2522%253A%2522feature-small%2522%252C%2522body%2522%253A%2522%253Cinline-embed%2520type%253D%255C%2522image%255C%2522%2520meta%253D%255C%2522%25257B%252522type%252522%25253A%252522image%252522%25252C%252522url%252522%25253A%252522%25252Fphotos%25252F5bce1235936ebe2cd0ab0a0e%252522%25252C%252522width%252522%25253A%252522%252522%25252C%252522height%252522%25253A%252522%252522%25252C%252522caption%252522%25253A%252522%252522%25257D%255C%2522%2520ref%253D%255C%25225bce1235936ebe2cd0ab0a0e%255C%2522%253E%253C%252Finline-embed%253E%2522%252C%2522attrs%2522%253A%257B%257D%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%22%5C%22%3E%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22image%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522image%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%2522%252Fphotos%252F5bce1235936ebe2cd0ab0a0e%2522%252C%2522width%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522height%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522caption%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%225bce1235936ebe2cd0ab0a0e%5C%22%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%3Cp%3EAs%20we%20spoke%2C%20a%20car%E2%80%99s%20headlights%20swept%20across%20the%20front%20window%20and%20soon%20the%20church%20door%20swung%20open.%20It%20was%20Lana%20Heath%20de%20Martinez%2C%20one%20of%20the%20sanctuary%20organizers.%20She%20had%20brought%20Marcela%20and%20Gabriel%20home%20from%20the%20library%2C%20where%20Marcela%20had%20been%20doing%20her%20homework.%20Marcela%2C%20a%20thin%20girl%2C%20already%20the%20same%20height%20as%20her%20mother%2C%20wearing%20large%20glasses%20and%20carrying%20a%20binder%2C%20walked%20quickly%20through%20the%20lobby%20and%20downstairs%20to%20join%20her%20mother.%20At%20a%20glance%2C%20she%20looked%20like%20an%20ordinary%2C%20studious%2C%20and%20cheerful%20eleven-year-old%20girl.%20But%20Marcela%20lives%20in%20a%20basement%20with%20her%20mother%2C%20who%20wears%20an%20ankle%20bracelet%2C%20and%20is%20under%20an%20order%20of%20deportation.%20She%20has%20a%20five-year-old%20sister%20who%20she%20hasn%E2%80%99t%20seen%20since%20she%20was%20a%20baby.%20If%20Marcela%20and%20her%20mother%20return%20to%20Honduras%2C%20as%20the%20U.S.%20government%20is%20ordering%2

Arevalo-Herrera, there are a few remaining legal routes to relief, but none of them are easy, and each is subject to the uniquely convoluted and logic-challenged world of immigration law. First, if Pereira v. Sessions is interpreted the way that Kilpatrick and other immigrant advocates hope, Arevalo-Herrera’s order of removal could be terminated—this is equivalent to a dismissal—because she was never notified of the hearing of her case. But that would only bring her back to her asylum case, which has been made far more difficult, perhaps even impossible, to win by  Sessions’s announcement that victims of sexual assault no longer qualify."],["p","There is a simpler way for Arevalo-Herrera to stay in the country. In 2016, federal regulations were changed, making someone like her, who is married to a lawful permanent resident, eligible for a green card. She would return to Honduras for a medical exam and an interview with the State Department, and, after period of time—Kilpatrick says it could be between three weeks and three months—return to the United States with a green card. But ",["em",{"class":"small"},"ICE"],"’s position is that Arevalo-Herrera’s original sin—that of missing her first court appearance—supersedes all other considerations. This was, again, the court appearance for which they didn’t give her the time or date. “What’s particularly egregious about the actions of ",["em",{"class":"small"},"ICE"]," in this case,” Kilpatrick said, “is that they know that Abbie’s husband has a green card, and that she’s eligible to remain in the United States while she adjusts her status. But they just don’t care.”"],["p","Earlier that evening, sitting in the church office with the rain hitting the glass above, Arevalo-Herrera asked that people consider her fate and that of other immigrants who share her situation. “I would like people to keep in mind that, if we’re coming to this country, it’s because we are truly suffering in our own countries,” she said. “I’ve seen a lot of women that were mutilated, their arms were cut off. Or they’ll cut your face. And it’s really sad to see that the abusers use our own children to hurt us. Maybe people don’t know the need that we have to be protected. And that our governments are not doing a good job, that they don’t defend the rights of women and children. But I feel hope in people, the people who have been surrounding me lately.” She rubbed her face and closed her eyes, and continued speaking with her eyes shut. “And I have hope that people will recognize that we’re people, too, with faith and hopes. And that our human dignity is being violated. And that it’s so sad to come here to seek refuge, and we can’t find it.”"],["hr"],["p",["em","Below is the “Notice to Appear” document calling for Arevalo-Herrera to appear in an immigration court.

Yorker"]," reporter that Steve Bannon was, metaphorically, “trying to suck [his] own cock.” No hard feelings about the firing, though. Trump is a “genius,” Scaramucci insists in his book. Watching him on television is “like watching Joe DiMaggio play for Schreiber High School’s baseball team.” (The diamond serves as one of many Moochian touchstones, as does F. Scott Fitzgerald, “one of my early favorite authors.”) For Scaramucci, the President incarnates Jay Gatsby, surrounded by glittering wealth yet attuned to the forgotten strivers of the past, back when the Catskill Mountains were taller than the Himalayas and “primitive versions of the vampire bat—a distant ancestor of Steve Bannon, I believe” hung “upside down in the caves.” If all this sounds grandiose, too bad. “Have you ever met a successful person who didn’t have an ego?”  Scaramucci, a man once characterized as “",["a",{"href":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/08/01/goodbye-mooch-late-night-hosts-bid-farewell-to-anthony-scaramucci/"},"the human embodiment of a double-parked BMW"],",” writes. “When you combine just enough ego with self-worth, and you add my personality, which some have categorized as ‘wacky,’ what’s produced is a supercharged sales machine who might drive you nuts or charm you, or both,” he explains."],["p","On Monday night, the eve of the book’s release, SkyBridge Capital, Scaramucci’s investment firm, convenes a group of celebrants to drink wine and nibble on hanger steak served from large gleaming buffet dishes at Hunt &amp; Fish Club, the midtown steak house once described by the New York ",["em","Post"]," as the spot “Where Beauties Trawl for Sugar Daddies.” The venue has a power-lunch ambience, even at 7 ",["em",{"class":"small"},"p.m."]," (One realizes that the “power lunch” vibe is achieved by importing a dusky, after-hours luxury into the middle of the day.) Plastic candles hang upside down from the ceiling, shedding a soft glow on a room packed with Brooks Brothers suits, millennial-pink ties, and beefy, grinning faces. The women wear flowing “out on the town” hair and sheath dresses. A d.j. stands at the back, next to a bar adorned with red and white roses. Young people pose in front of a photo screen beside leaning towers of “Trump, the Blue-Collar President,” pointing to the books and then to themselves and then to their drinks and then at the chandeliers. In addition to wine and liquor, the bar offers a specialty cocktail called When Life Gives You Lemons. “Trump, the Blue-Collar President” aspires to be a comeback narrative, with Scaramucci in the role of Rocky “when the music starts to swell and Balboa is getting up from the mat  . . . when Apollo Creed starts looking worried.”"],["p","Everyone here appears to work in finance. “Do you work in finance?” I start asking. I talk to a guy from Long Island, one of the best friends of Scaramucci’s cousin Augie. He and Augie have just launched a business venture together. Augie’s friend seems tickled by the banker-fancy décor. Though he hasn’t yet read Tony’s book, he wanted to show up for the neighborhood kid who made good, the “character” whom he acknowledges is “fun to talk to, very colorful.” I ask how he feels about the President. “No comment,” he says, grinning. Then he looks concerned: “Maybe I shouldn’t be here.”"],["p","The energy in the room knots and condenses. The Mooch has landed, and a cloud of admirers descend with their unsigned copies and their iPhones. A woman pushes her date toward the epicenter with an exasperated hiss: “He’s your pal. Support him!” I approach the cumulus of designer watches and Dolce &amp; Gabbana. “Are you friends with Tony?” I ask a blond woman, her striking eyes hooded in indigo shadow. Her partner beams: “She’s the beautician for the whole family!” For a moment, I think he says “mortician.” Upon a white-shrouded table, someone has placed a blue collar with Scaramucci’s name stitched across it. I talk to Chris Windle, the operations manager at Allied/All-City, a utility and pipeline-services company. He’s wearing a bejewelled crucifix on a gold chain and chatting with his friend George Sigelakis, who is revolutionizing the fire hydrant. Sigelakis, a former firefighter, has designed an extra-durable, tamper-proof hydrant that resists both rust and corrosion. We look at pictures on his phone.

In a rare public appearance, Kushner revealed himself as a soft-spoken but supremely self-confident figure, a person who clearly doesn’t consider his thin résumé to be a handicap in tackling some of the world’s thorniest issues. And, after about seventeen minutes, Jones finally got down to business, asking him whether he believed the Saudi account of what happened to Khashoggi."],["p","“We’re obviously getting as many facts as we can from the different places, and then we’ll determine which facts are credible,” Kushner said. That was flannel, but then things got kind of interesting, as Kushner provided what appeared to be a strategic rationale for going soft on the crown prince or, at least, giving him some more time to come up with a less risible cover story for Khashoggi’s murder: “I’ll also say that we have to be able to work with our allies,” Kushner said. “And Saudi Arabia has been a very strong ally in terms of pushing back against Iran’s aggression, which is funding a lot of terror in the region, whether it’s the Houthis in Yemen or Hezbollah and Hamas, we have a lot of terrorism in the region. The Middle East is a rough place. It’s been a rough place for a very long time, and we have to be able to pursue our strategic objectives, but we also have to deal with what obviously seems to be a terrible situation.”"],["p","If this was pragmatism, it was pragmatism colored by a very particular and one-sided view of the world. Yes, the Middle East is a troubled place, but it is also a complicated one. Until pretty recently, Iranian-backed militias were fighting inside Iraq alongside U.S.-backed forces in the war against ",["em",{"class":"small"},"ISIS"],". In casting the overriding issue in the Middle East as Iranian aggression, Kushner was promulgating a simplistic, ahistorical line favored by the Saudi monarchy, Benjamin Netanyahu’s government in Israel, and many of the same Washington foreign-policy “experts” who dragged the United States into the war in Iraq."],["p","To portray the many Saudi atrocities in Yemen as “pushing back against Iran’s aggression” isn’t merely misleading: it is outrageous. Jones didn’t pick up on that one. But he did ask Kushner whether he trusted the Saudis to investigate themselves, given that the crown prince “is like the prime suspect who is also the prime investigator.” Kushner confirmed that he had spoken personally to the prince, advising him to be “fully transparent,” because “this is a very, very serious accusation, and a very serious situation.” However, Kushner then declined to take Jones’s invitation to say that Khashoggi’s murder had shaken his confidence in his Saudi partner. Instead, he returned to his previous theme, saying Saudi Arabia is a “critical partner” in the fight against terrorism, praising some of the domestic reforms the crown prince had introduced, and concluding by saying, “We are hopeful we can keep pushing forward with a lot of the initiatives that further American interests and push back against Iran’s aggression, and we are going to stay focussed on that.”"],["p","Before moving on to other subjects, Jones raised another thorny question: To what extent, if any, is the Trump Administration culpable, at least by association, for the crown prince’s brutal policies, including what happened to Khashoggi? Jones didn’t phrase his question precisely in this way. Instead, he asked Kushner how he reacted to people who “are mad at Jared Kushner,” because they believe that the crown prince killed Khashoggi and “it’s your fault because if you hadn’t been friends with him he wouldn’t have felt like he could get away with it.”"],["p","Kushner quickly brushed the question aside, saying, “Look, I don’t respond to the critics.” But, of course, he had already responded in his previous statements, and in what he had chosen not to say. Without prejudicing the outcomes of the various investigations into Khashoggi’s death, Kushner, a former newspaper proprietor, after all, could surely have asserted the principle that the United States shouldn’t embrace dictators who order the killing of journalists employed by American newspapers. He didn’t do it, and the omission spoke volumes."]]],"canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"sections":[{"id":"5904126172dadf5d0a508800","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news","children":[{"id":"59ef6620c6604764e97c762c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"59ef6620c6604764e97c762c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Our Columnists","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"our-columnists"},{"id":"5904126172dadf5d0a508800","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news"},{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"}],"name":"Our Columnists","parent":[{"id":"5904126172dadf5d0a508800","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"},"slug":"our-columnists"}]}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"web","contributors":[{"name":"John Cassidy","type":"author","title":"John Cassidy has been a staff writer at \u003cem&gt;The New Yorker\u003c/em&gt; since 1995.

These changes, like the attacks on transgender rights in the United States, are politically expedient and logical: reversing the most recent and most rapid social change makes it seem like the promise of a return to the imaginary past will be fulfilled."],["p","But, for transgender and intersex people, having rights taken away is just not a return to a time before those rights were gained.

Many more adults don’t fit in them, either. The Administration’s proposed definition of sex, which runs counter to the development of both the scientific and social understandings of human variety, views anyone who is not clearly and immovably gendered as an anomaly. Trump’s is the politics of simplistic categories designed to exclude ever greater numbers of people.

ago, amid the most overt privations of Jim Crow, African-Americans used to tell a joke about a black Harvard professor who moves to the Deep South and tries to register to vote. A white clerk tells him that he will first have to read aloud a paragraph from the Constitution. When he easily does so, the clerk says that he will also have to read and translate a section written in Spanish. Again he complies. The clerk then demands that he read sections in French, German, and Russian, all of which he happens to speak fluently. Finally, the clerk shows him a passage in Arabic. The professor looks at it and says, “My Arabic is rusty, but I believe this translates to ‘Negroes cannot vote in this county.’ ”"],["p","Old jokes have lately been finding renewed salience. Literacy tests, poll taxes, and grandfather clauses, once the most common mechanisms for disadvantaging minority voters, have been consigned to the history books, but one need look no further than the governor’s race in Georgia to see their modern equivalents in action. The race between the Republican, Brian Kemp, Georgia’s secretary of state, and the Democrat, Stacey Abrams, the former minority leader of the state House of Representatives—who, if she wins, will be the first black female governor in the country—is a virtual tie. But Kemp has invoked the so-called exact-match law to suspend fifty-three thousand voter-registration applications, for infractions as minor as a hyphen missing from a surname. African-Americans make up thirty-two per cent of the state’s population, but they represent nearly seventy per cent of the suspended applications. Kemp’s move is particularly questionable given that Abrams’s electoral strategy hinges on mobilizing the six hundred thousand unregistered black voters who have long been seen as the holy grail of Democratic politics in the state."],["p","Kemp’s acts are singled out for scrutiny in “One Person, No Vote,” a book about modern-day voter suppression, by the historian Carol Anderson. In 2012, after the Asian American Legal Advocacy Center, in Atlanta, discovered that many of its clients who were naturalized citizens were not on the voter rolls, despite having registered, the group raised the issue with Kemp’s office. “In a show of raw intimidation,” Anderson writes, “Kemp ordered an investigation questioning the methods that the organization had used to register new voters.” In 2014, Kemp investigated the New Georgia Project, a voter-registration initiative that Abrams had founded. In a similar vein, officials in Jefferson County last week ordered a group of African-American senior citizens off a bus taking them to an early-voting site, on the ground that the transportation, which had been organized by the nonpartisan group Black Voters Matter, was a “political activity.”"],["p","The events in Georgia are part of a broader political project. The xenophobia and the resentment that Donald Trump stirred up during the 2016 election are fundamentally concerns about the future of the American electorate. (His reported comment that too many people are immigrating from “shithole countries” in Africa and the Caribbean was paired with a lament that not enough are coming from Europe.) He has repeatedly stated that he lost the popular vote because non-citizens voted for Hillary Clinton. Last Thursday, at a rally in Montana, he suggested that Democrats were responsible for a caravan of migrants now heading north from Honduras, because they “figure everybody coming in is going to vote Democrat.” Kemp, likewise, claimed that Abrams wants to let undocumented people vote in Georgia. The suppression of minority votes is the homegrown corollary of this strategy—an attempt to place a white thumb on the demographic scale."],["p","According to the Brennan Center for Justice, ninety-nine bills designed to diminish voter access were introduced last year in thirty-one state legislatures. Many of the recent Republican-led efforts stem from the Supreme Court’s 2013 decision in Shelby v. Holder. In an opinion that eviscerated the Voting Rights Act of 1965, Chief Justice John Roberts wrote that discrimination still exists, but not sufficiently to warrant the “extraordinary” remediation measures that the act imposed on the states of the former Confederacy. That argument is roughly equivalent to saying that a decline in the prevalence of an infectious disease means that we should stop vaccinating against it. Within hours of the decision, Texas announced a strict new voter-I.D. law. Mississippi and Alabama shortly afterward began enforcing similar laws that previously had been barred."],["p","The decision added a layer of severity to a voter-access crisis precipitated by state laws that prohibit six million Americans with past convictions from voting. In three Southern states—Florida, Tennessee, and Kentucky—this means that at least twenty per cent of eligible-age African-Americans cannot vote. Meanwhile, North Carolina enacted restrictions on early voting, a policy that particularly affects African-Americans, who are likely to be hourly-wage workers and cannot always get to the polls on Election Day. Last year, the Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal to reinstate a voter-I.D. law in North Carolina that a federal court had found targeted black voters “with almost surgical precision.” In effect, the question posed by Roberts’s ruling is how much discrimination there has to be before you can justify protecting voters."],["p","Ironically, though, a number of the recent laws validate Roberts’s argument about the undue burden that the Voting Rights Act put on the South; complaints have been lodged in several states that fought for the Union, such as Ohio, Wisconsin, Indiana, and Iowa, which have passed strict voter-I.D. or roll-purge laws. Earlier this year, in Kansas, a federal judge struck down a law that required voters to provide proof of citizenship to register, championed by Kris Kobach, the secretary of state, who served as a vice-chair of Donald Trump’s short-lived voter-fraud commission and is now running for governor. In North Dakota, which didn’t become a state until twenty-four years after the Civil War, Native Americans must now provide an I.D. that shows a street address—even though many have only a P.O. box."],["p","The midterm elections are in two weeks. The results will be read as a referendum primarily on Trump’s Presidency, but also on the effectiveness of the electoral restrictions. The old punch line has changed: a professor fluent in five languages no longer need travel south to encounter voter suppression. Voter access is not just a regional crisis; it is a national one. ♦"]]],"canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"sections":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine","children":[{"id":"592dfa44d5fda942c34a0b61","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"592dfa44d5fda942c34a0b61","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Comment","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"comment"},{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"},{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"}],"name":"Comment","parent":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"},"slug":"comment"}]}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"magazine","contributors":[{"name":"Jelani Cobb","type":"author","title":"Jelani Cobb is a staff writer at \u003cem&gt;The New Yorker\u003c/em&gt; and the author of “\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/080271739X/?tag=thneyo0f-20\"&gt;The Substance of Hope: Barack Obama and the Paradox of Progress\u003c/a&gt;.”","email":"","bio":["div",["p","Jelani Cobb has been contributing to ",["em","The New Yorker"]," since 2012, and became a staff writer in 2015.

It confirmed Khashoggi’s death—a “painful outcome,” it said—and blithely reversed the kingdom’s repeated and insistent lies that he had safely walked out of the consulate in Istanbul shortly after he entered it, on October 2nd. Sixteen days later, the Saudis said that they need another month to investigate his death, which would conveniently time the release of their findings to the aftermath of a pivotal midterm election in the United States.

In many ways, an investigation involving the crown prince—who is popularly known as M.B.S., after his initials—is like asking Tony Soprano to help figure out who was behind a mob hit. “It is absurd to entrust the investigation of Khashoggi’s murder to those most likely to have ordered it,” Summer Lopez, the senior director of ",["em",{"class":"small"},"PEN"]," America’s Free Expression Programs, which has championed the case, said in a statement.

Senator Tim Kaine, Democrat of Virginia, who was Hillary Clinton’s running-mate in 2016, called the Saudi statement “insulting,” adding that, “since the Trump Administration won’t stand up against atrocity, Congress must.”"],["p","“To say that I am skeptical of the new Saudi narrative about Mr. Khashoggi is an understatement,” Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, tweeted shortly after the news broke.

José Luis Hernández, a thirty-two-year-old Honduran, settled in Los Angeles, he had tried three times to come to the United States. When he was sixteen, after gangsters in Honduras threatened to kill him, he made the trip with two other boys, but they were attacked by extortionists at the Mexican border, robbed, and eventually apprehended by Mexican authorities. (“We were like three little sheep thrown to ten lions,” he said.) Two years later, he undertook the journey again, this time with a slightly larger group. In Mexico, he fell from a moving freight train—part of a network that spans the country known as the Beast—and lost an arm, half of one leg, and part of his left hand. Once more he was deported to Honduras. When he finally left the hospital, after a two-year recovery, Hernández began planning another trip. “If we don’t risk anything, we don’t live,” he told me. “There aren’t any other options.” In 2015, he joined a group of disabled Honduran asylum seekers who called themselves the Caravan of the Mutilated, and together they reached Texas."],["p","I called Hernández earlier this week because ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump"},"Donald Trump"]," had just learned that, after ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-administration-is-rushing-to-turn-trumps-latest-immigration-tweets-into-a-real-policy"},"a similar episode"]," in April, a large group of Honduran migrants was once again heading north toward the U.S. The President’s ranting began, on Twitter, as the group crossed the Guatemalan border, still about a thousand miles south of Texas. Trump called them “",["em",{"class":"small"},"CRIMINALS"],",” blamed their trip on “open border” Democrats, vowed to “",["em",{"class":"small"},"CLOSE OUR SOUTHERN BORDER"],",” and threatened to cut off aid to all the Central American governments who had “no control over their population.” Late last week, when the migrants first gathered in San Pedro Sula, in northern Honduras, the group consisted of roughly six hundred people; by Wednesday, their ranks had swelled to around four thousand. “This is how it works,” Hernández told me. “People making the trip see others, they see the bigger group, and they join it. These are people fleeing for their lives. It’s not some coördinated, political thing.”"],["p","An agreement among the governments of Central America allows citizens of Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador, and Nicaragua to move freely across the countries’ borders without the need for passports. But they still have to go through government checkpoints along the way, where Trump’s aggressive posturing has had an immediate effect. On Tuesday, Guatemalan police arrested a Honduran journalist named Bartolo Fuentes, the host of a popular radio program on migration, who was accused by the Honduran government of having organized the caravan. (Fuentes was released on Friday; by most accounts, he was covering the caravan in its early stages as a journalist.) According to Fuentes and his wife, U.S. Embassy officials were present for his arrest, which would be highly irregular, not least because the penalty for failing to present oneself to immigration authorities in Guatemala is a thirty-dollar fine but no jail time. (A spokesperson for the State Department told me that no U.S. Embassy personnel were present.)"],["p","The Honduran government, headed by a U.S. ally named Juan Orlando Hernández, has vilified Fuentes as a political actor, emphasizing the fact that, between 2013 and 2017, he served in Congress as a member of an opposition party called ",["em",{"class":"small"},"LIBRE"],". If Trump has the Democrats to scapegoat, Juan Orlando Hernández has ",["em",{"class":"small"},"LIBRE"],", and both leaders stand to gain from portraying the humanitarian crisis as a political one. One piece of widely disseminated government propaganda described Fuentes as “a professional coyote,” or smuggler, and it dismissed the migrants’ caravan as a political ploy by an opposition party to “hurt the image of the [Honduran] government.” The head of the U.S. Embassy in Honduras, Heide Fulton, validated these attacks in an ",["a",{"href":"https://twitter.com/USAmbHonduras/status/1052679954134167552"},"address"]," posted on Twitter, where she urged migrants not to be “deceived by false promises made by leaders with political aims.”"],["p","Hernández, in particular, has reason to be defensive: in November, with the Americans’ backing, he won reëlection despite ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/in-honduras-calls-rise-for-new-presidential-elections"},"international outcry"]," over massive and demonstrable fraud.

Monday afternoon, I received an e-mail that was short and to the point. “Please be advised that the reception for the National Day of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia on Thursday, October 18, from 6:00 to 8:00 pm has been cancelled,” it read. It was signed by Fatimah Baeshen, a spokesperson for the Saudi Embassy. No explanation for the cancellation was given, but, of course, none was needed: this was no time for the Saudis to throw a party for themselves, amid the furor over the disappearance and apparent gruesome murder of the dissident Saudi journalist ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/jamal-khashoggi"},"Jamal Khashoggi"],"."],["p","The basic facts have not changed much since Khashoggi, a Washington ",["em","Post"]," editorial columnist living in self-imposed exile in Virginia, entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, on October 2nd, never to reëmerge. But the story, fed by a stream of leaks from Turkish officials with ever more grisly details of what they say was Khashoggi’s capture, killing, and dismemberment by a team of fifteen Saudis, has turned into an international crisis, fuelled by the Saudis’ implausible denials and by ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump"},"President Trump"]," himself. Until Thursday, well into the third week since Khashoggi’s disappearance, Trump never even admitted the obvious fact of Khashoggi’s likely death, and he continues to act more like the Saudis’ lawyer in the court of world opinion than the aggrieved defender of human rights and free speech that an American President is supposed to be at such a moment. The belated announcement, late Friday evening, by the Saudis that Khashoggi was dead, and their new claim that he died in a scuffle with Saudi agents, will hardly quell the controversy. Nor will Trump’s near-instant pronouncement that the Saudi excuse was credible. Instead, thanks to Trump and his ardent embrace of Saudi Arabia’s brutal young crown prince, ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/04/09/a-saudi-princes-quest-to-remake-the-middle-east"},"Mohammed bin Salman"],", it’s about much more than the murder of a single man."],["p","In an era when Trump’s tweets and constant commentary produce news cycles of shorter and shorter duration, the Khashoggi affair may turn out to be the longest-running Washington plotline of this ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/midterms-2018"},"midterm-election season"],". The ",["em","Times’"]," revelation that Trump was a ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/the-trump-familys-tax-dodging-is-symptomatic-of-a-larger-problem"},"decades-long tax cheat"]," came and went. The September plea deal by Trump’s former campaign chairman Paul Manafort receded from the headlines. The national uproar over allegations of sexual misconduct by the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh lasted just under three weeks. Yet here we are, a full seventeen days and counting as I write this, with no end in sight as the Trump Administration blusters and blunders about in a search, so far unsuccessful, for a way to end the saga that does not involve a serious rupture with an ally central to its entire Mideast strategy."],["p","I’m not surprised by Washington’s obsession with the story: it’s the Trump Presidency distilled to its morally compromising, press-bashing, truth-denying essence. At a time when many question American leadership in the world, Trump’s combination of credulity and cynicism in response to the brutal murder of a dissident who sought refuge here gives the world’s bad guys yet another reason to cheer. Even many Republicans in Congress are furious at Trump, with the senators Lindsey Graham and Marco Rubio reëmerging as the tribunes of American virtue that they used to be, demanding Trump take tough action against the Saudis in response. Chris Murphy, the Democratic senator from Connecticut, told me that this particular outrage, in a world full of them, has resonated because “it’s a spy thriller, a page-turner.” He believes that dynamic will continue. Of the Saudis, he said, “Every day that goes by they don’t try to explain what happened is another day their credibility starts to evaporate in Congress.”"],["p","Already, it’s clear on Capitol Hill that American politics toward Saudi Arabia have shifted dramatically. In May of Trump’s first year in office, when I talked with Murphy about his efforts to get Congress to sanction Saudi Arabia over its ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/is-yemen-intentional-starvation-the-future-of-war"},"brutal war in neighboring Yemen"],", Murphy’s was a lonely fight. Now it’s a bipartisan consensus. “I’m mad and frustrated that it took the murder of one journalist for people to start paying attention to the murder of thousands of civilians inside Yemen, but still I see this as a belated turning point in our relationship with Saudi Arabia,” Murphy told me on Thursday. “I don’t put it outside the realm of possibility that the Saudis pull a rabbit out of a hat, but right now I don’t see how Congress continues to approve arms sales or maintain its unconditional approval for the war in Yemen.” If the Democrats take control of one or both houses of Congress next month, Murphy and others I spoke with expect more fallout, including investigations of Trump’s business interests with the Saudis (the President falsely claimed to have none at all, in one of the week’s more brazen tweets) and the extensive dealings between Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and the Saudi prince known as M.B.S., with whom Kushner has so famously bonded."],["p","As the days have extended into weeks with no Saudi explanation forthcoming and Trump’s own party breaking with him, the collateral damage in Washington is starting to accumulate. Lobbying firms and think tanks on the Saudi dole have been pressured into dropping the Kingdom as a client, including the Democratic-leaning firm the Glover Park Group and the G.O.P. firm Barbour, Griffith &amp; Rogers, which gave up a nearly million-dollar-a-year account after one of its founders, the Republican lobbyist Ed Rogers, was told by the Washington ",["em","Post’s"]," editorial-page editor, Fred Hiatt, to choose between his columns in Khashoggi’s newspaper or his firm’s paycheck from the Saudi government. The last time there was such an anti-Saudi backlash here was in 2001, when fifteen of the nineteen hijackers on 9/11 were revealed to be Saudi nationals."],["p","I spoke with one of the many lobbyists who have been caught up in the Khashoggi affair now that it has become a classic Washington moment, in which a money gusher deemed acceptable by the Beltway’s élite suddenly becomes politically untenable. The lobbyist blamed M.B.S. for not being what Washington wanted him to be. “We can’t all go and live in this guy’s lie. No way. It’s just too vivid and too morbid,” the lobbyist told me. “This isn’t one for everybody to get on board. It’s not going to work that way.” But he was also furious with Trump for exacerbating the scandal and turning it, once again, into a story about Trump himself. “Trump never handles anything right,” the lobbyist, a Republican, said. “Never. Never.”"],["p","Public scorn, meanwhile, has also been directed at those who shared the Trump Administration’s high regard for the crown prince and hailed him as a modernizing young reformer. The ",["em","Times"]," columnist Tom Friedman has taken endless grief for his column “Saudi Arabia’s Arab Spring, at Last,” from November, 2017, which was filled with encomiums for M.B.S., and long lists of pro-Saudi commentary by Washington’s Mideast hands have been widely circulated. Dennis Ross, the veteran Middle East diplomat who served Presidents of both parties, from George H. W. Bush to Barack Obama, is one of them. Like Friedman, Ross is no Trump apologist, but he wrote effusively about M.B.S.’s reforms, seeing them as a hopeful sign of Western-style moderation, not the centralizing impulse of the rising autocrat M.B.S. has turned out to be. “America should get behind Saudi Arabia’s revolutionary crown prince,” Ross wrote in the ",["em","Post"]," in February, in an article that has earned him loads of hate tweets this week. (His words, one commenter declared, “should live in infamy.”)"],["p","Ross told me that the latest controversy was a reminder of the uncomfortable truth about America’s decades-old alliance with Saudi Arabia: “The relationship with Saudi Arabia has always been based on interests, not values.” Ross said that he still sees M.B.S. as a religious modernizer whose country is a key partner for the United States, but that Trump has postponed an inevitable rebuke by failing to take a tougher line. “This cannot pass without a consequence, not only because of the Saudis but because everybody’s watching,” Ross told me. “You have to have norms, you have to have consequences, you have to show there are behaviors that really can’t be tolerated so this doesn’t become the new normal.”"],["p","But that argument, of course, is exactly why Trump has Washington worked up in a rare bipartisan lather. There may be accountability, at least for a moment, for the city’s pundits and influence peddlers. But, once again, the President himself seems insistent on brazening his way out of uncomfortable facts. It is a script we’ve seen Trump follow before: defending the Russian President, Vladimir Putin; praising the Chinese strongman Xi Jinping; falling “in love” with the North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un."],["p","All three of them, as the former Air Force general and National Security Agency chief Michael Hayden told the ",["em","Times"]," this week, have carried out extrajudicial attacks on foreign soil during the Trump Presidency. Many of Trump’s supporters say that the President’s words don’t matter, that his defense of tyrants is mere hyperbole. But I think back to an incident with Putin back in the early two-thousands, when American diplomats criticized the Russian President for the brutality of his war in Chechnya. Asked by a reporter about the criticism, Putin dismissed their complaints as unimportant. He hadn’t heard from his friend George W. Bush, Putin told the reporter, so it didn’t matter."],["p","Trump’s response to the Khashoggi affair represents “the Putinization of world order,” as Vance Serchuk, the foreign-policy adviser to the former C.I.A. director David Petraeus, put it to the ",["em","Post"],"’s Josh Rogin. It is the predictable outcome of a President who not only dismisses human rights but actually encourages others to flout them. Trump chose to make Saudi Arabia the first foreign trip of his Presidency, instead of Mexico or Canada, where our leaders traditionally go.
