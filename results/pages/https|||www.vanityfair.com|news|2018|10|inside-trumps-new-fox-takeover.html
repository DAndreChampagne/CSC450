He couldn’t contain him at all,” a high-level Fox staffer remembered.</p><p data-reactid="225">But now there’s a new boss in charge—sort of. His name is Lachlan Murdoch. In May, Rupert named Lachlan, his elder son, chairman and C.E.O. of “New Fox,” the slimmed-down parent company that will emerge out of the Murdochs’ $71 billion deal to sell most of their entertainment assets to Disney. Lachlan, 47, is the heir that Rupert most wanted to succeed him even though, of the candidates in the family, Lachlan seemed to want the job least. He’s never been a political junkie like his father, an overt careerist like younger brother James, or a rebellious entrepreneur like older sister Liz. In 2005, Lachlan famously walked away from the company after clashing with Ailes and former C.O.O. Peter Chernin and moved back to the family’s native Australia.</p><div id="AMS_VYF_INLINE_TEXT" class="component-consumer-marketing cm-unit article-in-text-mobile-cm-container"><div class="component-consumer-marketing-failsafe cm-failsafe"><div class="component-lazy loaded" data-component="Lazy"><a href="https://subscribe.vanityfair.com/subscribe/splits/vanityfair/VYF_FAILSAFE?source=FAILSAFE" target="_blank"><div class="component-in-article-cm"><span class="component-in-article-cm__hed"><!-- react-text: 617 -->Try <!-- /react-text --><em>Vanity Fair</em><!-- react-text: 619 --> and receive a free tote.<!-- /react-text --></span><span class="component-in-article-cm__cta">Join Now</span></div></a></div></div></div><div id="AMS_VYF_INLINE_TEXT" class="component-consumer-marketing cm-unit article-in-text-tablet-cm-container"><div id="cns-ads-slot-type-ams-vyf-inline-text-0" class="cns-ads-stage cns-ads-slot-type-ams-vyf-inline-text cns-ads-slot-type-ams-vyf-inline-text-0 cns-ads-slot-state-filled cns-ads-slot-size-793x74" data-name="AMS_VYF_INLINE_TEXT_0" data-slot-type="AMS_VYF_INLINE_TEXT" style="font-size: 0px; line-height: 0; overflow: hidden;"><div id="AMS_VYF_INLINE_TEXT_0" class="cns-ads-container" data-ad-seq="0" style="margin: 0px auto; box-sizing: content-box; height: 74px; min-height: 74px; width: 793px; min-width: 793px;" data-google-query-id="CPX54evtxN4CFYklfwod614Kyg"><div id="google_ads_iframe_3379/vanityfair.cm/news_5__container__" style="border: 0pt none; margin: auto; text-align: center; height: 74px; min-height: 74px; width: 793px; min-width: 793px;"><iframe id="google_ads_iframe_3379/vanityfair.cm/news_5" title="3rd party ad content" name="google_ads_iframe_3379/vanityfair.cm/news_5" width="793" height="74" scrolling="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" frameborder="0" srcdoc="" style="border: 0px; vertical-align: bottom; height: 74px; min-height: 74px; width: 793px; min-width: 793px;" data-google-container-id="8" data-load-complete="true"></iframe></div></div></div><div class="component-consumer-marketing-failsafe cm-failsafe"><div class="component-lazy pending" data-component="Lazy"></div></div></div><div id="AMS_VYF_INLINE_TEXT" class="component-consumer-marketing cm-unit article-in-text-desktop-cm-container"><div class="component-consumer-marketing-failsafe cm-failsafe"><div class="component-lazy loaded" data-component="Lazy"><a href="https://subscribe.vanityfair.com/subscribe/splits/vanityfair/VYF_FAILSAFE?source=FAILSAFE" target="_blank"><div class="component-in-article-cm"><span class="component-in-article-cm__hed"><!-- react-text: 630 -->Try <!-- /react-text --><em>Vanity Fair</em><!-- react-text: 632 --> and receive a free tote.<!-- /react-text --></span><span class="component-in-article-cm__cta">Join Now</span></div></a></div></div></div><p data-reactid="229">Having returned to the fold, Lachlan has so far been content to be a caretaker rather than an empire builder. Although his nameplate was installed on an office at Fox News several months ago, Lachlan, who ran the <em>New York Post</em> in the 1990s, mostly is an absentee manager, choosing instead to work from the company’s Los Angeles office. When he occasionally drops in on Fox’s morning editorial meeting, he doesn’t cut a big presence. “He’s polite and asks questions about the news. He’s respectful and comes off as someone trying to learn,” one attendee said. In fact, Lachlan’s highest-profile decision was to hire Donald Trump’s former communications director, Hope Hicks, to be New Fox’s spokesperson. He didn’t know Hicks well—they had met only a handful of times—but he was encouraged by Trump and <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/people/jared-kushner#intcid=dt-hot-link">Jared Kushner</a> to hire her. “It seems like he was doing Trump a favor,” one Fox journalist said.</p><p data-reactid="230">With Lachlan content to let the Fox News machine run, the hand on the wheel belongs to Fox News C.E.O. Suzanne Scott. Scott’s management style is to effectively let the network’s producers run their shows independently. “No one is in charge,” a former executive told me. Without clear direction from the top, it’s every man for himself.</p><p data-reactid="231">Fox’s hugely successful alliance with Trump has amplified divisions and rivalries among Fox’s on-air talent. Shepard Smith has emerged as the network’s most visible capital-<em>J</em>  journalist and quasi-ombudsman. He’s used his three P.M. newscast to debunk Trump conspiracies, like the Uranium One obsession, and give airtime to investigative stories such as <em>The New York Times</em>’s 14,000-word exposé on Trump’s alleged tax dodging. Sean Hannity has called Smith “clueless” and “so anti-Trump.” At Mar-a-Lago in April, Hannity was overheard trashing Smith to Trump, according to one person familiar with the conversation. “Hannity was denouncing Shep, and Trump was eating it up.” (Hannity denied making the remarks.) Behind the scenes, Smith has taken on a bigger role in shaping Fox’s news coverage and critiques stories he doesn’t like, something that’s rankled some executives. “He’s the one who’s power hungry. He’s trying to pull the place left,” one former executive said. (A Fox News spokesperson disputes this.) Access to Trump also stokes jealousies among hosts. Sources say business anchor Neil Cavuto has complained to colleagues about Lou Dobbs’s closeness with the president. (A Fox News spokesperson says this is “not true.”)</p><div data-reactid="232"><div class="callout small" data-type="callout"><div class="embed image row"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="pinterest-link-container"><img src="https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5bd2305d005a606878515eec/master/h_450,c_limit/cable-news-sherman-dec-2018-embed01.png" alt="" title="" data-pin-desc="" data-pin-credits="" /><a class="pinterest-link" href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vanityfair.com%2Fnews%2F2018%2F10%2Finside-trumps-new-fox-takeover&amp;media=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.vanityfair.com%2Fphotos%2F5bd2305d005a606878515eec%2Fmaster%2Fh_450%2Cc_limit%2Fcable-news-sherman-dec-2018-embed01.png&amp;description=" target="_blank"></a></div></figure></div></div></div><p data-reactid="233">Trump’s dominance of Fox is partly an accident, as a result of the lack of strong internal leadership. And, of course, in ratings terms, it’s been a happy accident. But the outcome is precisely the one Ailes had warned against: the network’s identity is now inseparable from that of the president, a development that would have surely horrified Ailes. Ailes may have been a right-winger, but he was sophisticated enough to know that Fox needed enough plausible distance from the subjects it covers to maintain the fiction of being “Fair &amp; Balanced.” Now Fox is effectively an arm of the White House. Trump derives “policy” ideas from segments he likes and counts Sean Hannity as one of his closest advisers. The administration can feel like a Fox greenroom on a heavy news day. John Bolton serves as Trump’s national-security adviser; former Fox contributor <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/people/ben-carson#intcid=dt-hot-link">Ben Carson</a> runs HUD; former <em>Fox &amp; Friends</em> newsreader Heather Nauert serves as State Department spokesperson; and former Fox president Bill Shine is deputy chief of staff for communications. (Hannity lobbied for him to get the job.) Fox military analyst General Jack Keane has been discussed inside the West Wing as a successor to Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, a former White House official said. One Fox personality literally got into bed with the Trumps: former <em>The Five</em> co-host Kimberly Guilfoyle is dating Don junior.</p><div id="cns-ads-slot-type-article-in-text-0" class="cns-ads-stage cns-ads-slot-type-article-in-text cns-ads-slot-type-article-in-text-0" data-name="article_in_text_0" data-slot-type="article_in_text" style="font-size: 0px; line-height: 0; overflow: hidden;"><div id="article_in_text_0" class="cns-ads-container" data-ad-seq="0" style="margin: 0px auto; box-sizing: content-box;"></div></div><p data-reactid="234">For hosts and producers, it’s a strange, though not entirely unfamiliar, environment. Fox hosts regularly get calls from Trump about segments he likes—or doesn’t. “When you worked at Fox, you knew that at any moment Roger Ailes was watching. Every day was like a job interview with Ailes. Now it’s the same way for Trump,” says a veteran Fox News contributor. According to sources, Trump doesn’t explicitly dictate talking points the way Ailes did, but over time the effect can be similar. “What he usually does is he’ll call after a show and say, ‘I really enjoyed that,’” a former Fox anchor told me. “The highest compliment is ‘I really learned something.’ Then you know he got a new policy idea.”</p><p data-reactid="235">The fact that the news staff knows Trump always could be tuning in means the network is being programmed for an audience of one. “He has the same embattled view as a typical Fox viewer—that ‘the liberal elites hate me; they’re trying to bring me down,’ ” the former executive said. At times, anchors will use Fox segments to send messages directly to Trump. The day <em>The New York Times</em> reported Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein discussed tape-recording Trump to rally support amongst the Cabinet to invoke the 25th Amendment, Hannity told Trump the article was a trap to bait him into firing Rosenstein.</p><div data-reactid="236"><div class="callout small" data-type="callout"><div class="embed image row"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="pinterest-link-container"><img src="https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5bd2305a7473bd560f08b0ca/master/h_450,c_limit/cable-news-sherman-dec-2018-embed02.jpg" alt="" title="" data-pin-desc="" data-pin-credits="" /><a class="pinterest-link" href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vanityfair.com%2Fnews%2F2018%2F10%2Finside-trumps-new-fox-takeover&amp;media=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.vanityfair.com%2Fphotos%2F5bd2305a7473bd560f08b0ca%2Fmaster%2Fh_450%2Cc_limit%2Fcable-news-sherman-dec-2018-embed02.jpg&amp;description=" target="_blank"></a></div><figcaption class="caption callout-image-caption"><div class="wrapper"><span class="caption"></span><div class="credits">Photo by Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty Images.</div></div></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p data-reactid="237">Rupert Murdoch’s relationship with Trump, and his network’s importance in maintaining the protective bubble of propaganda around the president, is one of some irony. Murdoch has wanted a personal relationship with an American president ever since he decamped from London to New York, in the 1970s (he was not particularly close with <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/people/george-w-bush#intcid=dt-hot-link">George W. Bush</a>, the last Republican to hold the office). With Trump, he’s achieved that goal—though he has told friends he thinks Trump is a “buffoon” and his strongest personal allegiances (much like Trump’s, actually) are to the elites that Trump uses as his whipping boys. But Murdoch prizes profits above ideology, so he accommodated Trump in order to preserve access. Before the inauguration, I reported that Trump asked Murdoch to submit names for the position of F.C.C. commissioner. (Murdoch denied it at the time.)</p><p data-reactid="238">The question for Lachlan going forward is the same one that has vexed the Republican Party in the age of Trump: when to break from Trump, if a divorce is even possible. At moments there have been frays in the bond, as when Trump doted on Vladimir Putin in Helsinki (Neil Cavuto called it “disgusting”) or attacked Brett Kavanaugh’s accuser Dr. Christine Blasey Ford (a <em>Fox &amp; Friends</em> host said Trump “chose to blow it”). This fall, panic swept through Fox’s executive ranks as it looked like Democrats had a chance to retake both the House and the Senate. “They are deathly afraid of the Dems taking the House,” one high-level staffer said. The fear, according to the staffer, is that congressional committees investigating the Trump White House could draw in Fox. “Fox is hiring lobbyists to prepare,” the staffer said. Ominously for both Fox and the president, Trump’s rallies are not drawing the numbers they once did. As Politico reported, a Trump rally on August 30, carried live in Tucker Carlson’s regular prime-time slot, drew only 2.5 million viewers, whereas Carlson had been averaging more than 2.8 million. More recently, as Trump has been barnstorming ahead of the midterms, Fox has only been dipping into his rallies.</p><p data-reactid="239">But mostly, Fox doesn’t have much of a choice when it comes to Trump. And why not? On the day Kavanaugh shouted his way through his Senate Judiciary Committee testimony, Fox attracted a near-record 5.7 million viewers—more than MSNBC and CNN combined.</p><h3 data-reactid="240">More

Shepard Smith has emerged as the network&amp;#x2019;s most visible capital-&lt;em&gt;J&lt;/em&gt;  journalist and quasi-ombudsman. He&amp;#x2019;s used his three P.M. newscast to debunk Trump conspiracies, like the Uranium One obsession, and give airtime to investigative stories such as &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#x2019;s 14,000-word expos&amp;#xE9; on Trump&amp;#x2019;s alleged tax dodging.

And, of course, in ratings terms, it&amp;#x2019;s been a happy accident. But the outcome is precisely the one Ailes had warned against: the network&amp;#x2019;s identity is now inseparable from that of the president, a development that would have surely horrified Ailes. Ailes may have been a right-winger, but he was sophisticated enough to know that Fox needed enough plausible distance from the subjects it covers to maintain the fiction of being &amp;#x201C;Fair &amp;amp; Balanced.&amp;#x201D; Now Fox is effectively an arm of the White House. Trump derives &amp;#x201C;policy&amp;#x201D; ideas from segments he likes and counts Sean Hannity as one of his closest advisers. The administration can feel like a Fox greenroom on a heavy news day. John Bolton serves as Trump&amp;#x2019;s national-security adviser; former Fox contributor &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/people/ben-carson#intcid=dt-hot-link\"&gt;Ben Carson&lt;/a&gt; runs HUD; former &lt;em&gt;Fox &amp;amp; Friends&lt;/em&gt; newsreader Heather Nauert serves as State Department spokesperson; and former Fox president Bill Shine is deputy chief of staff for communications. (Hannity lobbied for him to get the job.) Fox military analyst General Jack Keane has been discussed inside the West Wing as a successor to Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, a former White House official said.

Every day was like a job interview with Ailes. Now it&amp;#x2019;s the same way for Trump,&amp;#x201D; says a veteran Fox News contributor. According to sources, Trump doesn&amp;#x2019;t explicitly dictate talking points the way Ailes did, but over time the effect can be similar. &amp;#x201C;What he usually does is he&amp;#x2019;ll call after a show and say, &amp;#x2018;I really enjoyed that,&amp;#x2019;&amp;#x201D; a former Fox anchor told me. &amp;#x201C;The highest compliment is &amp;#x2018;I really learned something.&amp;#x2019; Then you know he got a new policy idea.&amp;#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;","isEmbed":false,"type":"p"},{"content":"&lt;p&gt;The fact that the news staff knows Trump always could be tuning in means the network is being programmed for an audience of one. &amp;#x201C;He has the same embattled view as a typical Fox viewer&amp;#x2014;that &amp;#x2018;the liberal elites hate me; they&amp;#x2019;re trying to bring me down,&amp;#x2019; &amp;#x201D; the former executive said.

With Trump, he&amp;#x2019;s achieved that goal&amp;#x2014;though he has told friends he thinks Trump is a &amp;#x201C;buffoon&amp;#x201D; and his strongest personal allegiances (much like Trump&amp;#x2019;s, actually) are to the elites that Trump uses as his whipping boys. But Murdoch prizes profits above ideology, so he accommodated Trump in order to preserve access.

The fear, according to the staffer, is that congressional committees investigating the Trump White House could draw in Fox. &amp;#x201C;Fox is hiring lobbyists to prepare,&amp;#x201D; the staffer said. Ominously for both Fox and the president, Trump&amp;#x2019;s rallies are not drawing the numbers they once did.

So let’s just zero in on the money.\n&lt;p&gt;“I’m &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; rich,” Trump declared while announcing his candidacy in June 2015. To prove it, he released a “Summary of Net Worth” balance sheet, indicating a net worth of $8,737,540,000. A month later he upwardly revised that figure to “in excess of TEN BILLION DOLLARS.” (The caps are his.)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Since then, a cottage industry of spreadsheet-diving journalists has worked itself into a lather trying to peg his real net worth. But without tax returns to go on, it’s really anybody’s guess. Despite the all-caps figures Trump has dispensed, most estimates from the established financial-media outlets have been lower, FAR LOWER. &lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt; put his net worth at $4.5 billion. &lt;em&gt;Fortune&lt;/em&gt; postulated $3.7 billion, and later upped it to $3.9 billion. Bloomberg guessed it was “closer to $2.9 billion.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In response to these wanton guesstimates, Trump instinctually fired back at the guesstimators. “&lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt; is a bankrupt magazine, doesn’t know what they’re talking about.” “&lt;em&gt;Fortune&lt;/em&gt; has no idea what my assets are” and “has totally lost its way.” But the real sulfuric acid was reserved for the lowballers over at Bloomberg. As usual, Trump made it personal, even suggesting his “friend,” the former New York City mayor, might be jealous. “Maybe Michael told them to do it,” Trump speculated in the &lt;em&gt;Daily Mail,&lt;/em&gt; “because he always wanted to do what I’m doing.” Perhaps wisely, &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8212;even with its legendary phalanx of persnickety fact-checkers&amp;#8212;wouldn’t venture any closer than “just a back-of-the-envelope calculation” of $2.56 billion, “which shouldn’t be taken too seriously.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In November, Trump was elected president of the United States in a shocking turn of events. He lost the popular vote by some two million ballots.&lt;/p&gt;","socialMedia":[],"photos":{"tout":[{"aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":1400,"height":700,"format":"JPEG","url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2016/05/27/5748bf85ee949d2f614302a8_hive-contributor-profile-donald-trump.jpg"}},"revisionCreatedAt":"May 27, 2016 5:43 pm","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","image":true},"revisionAuthor":"Alyssa Karas","filename":"hive-contributor-profile-donald-trump.jpg","_embedded":{"categories-channels":[],"variantXsmall":[],"variantSmall":[],"variantMedium":[],"variantLarge":[],"variantXlarge":[],"_categories":{}},"title":"hive-contributor-profile-donald-trump.jpg","credit":"By John Lamparski/WireImage/Getty Images.","_links":{},"id":"5748bf85b58adb2f614da194","createdAt":"May 27, 2016 5:43 pm","revision":2,"modifiedAt":"May 27, 2016 5:43 pm","description":"Getty not 250: 522842094","contributors":{}}]},"pubDate":"May 25, 2017 11:21 am","url":"/people/donald-trump","mainPhotoContributors":{},"_embedded":{"photosTout":[{"fields":{"aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":1400,"height":700,"format":"JPEG","url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2016/05/27/5748bf85ee949d2f614302a8_hive-contributor-profile-donald-trump.jpg"}},"revisionCreatedAt":"May 27, 2016 5:43 pm","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","image":true},"revisionAuthor":"Alyssa Karas","filename":"hive-contributor-profile-donald-trump.jpg","_embedded":{"categories-channels":[],"variantXsmall":[],"variantSmall":[],"variantMedium":[],"variantLarge":[],"variantXlarge":[],"_categories":{}},"title":"hive-contributor-profile-donald-trump.jpg","credit":"By John Lamparski/WireImage/Getty Images.","_links":{},"id":"5748bf85b58adb2f614da194","createdAt":"May 27, 2016 5:43 pm","revision":2,"modifiedAt":"May 27, 2016 5:43 pm","description":"Getty not 250: 522842094","contributors":{}}}],"contributorsAuthor":[],"contributorsPhotographer":[],"_categories":{},"publishHistory":{"entityId":"5748bf9ab58adb2f614da195","revision":5,"pubDate":"May 25, 2017 11:21 am","revisionAuthor":"Jarondakie Patrick","searchable":true,"expired":false,"createdAt":"August 1, 2017 5:46 pm","uri":"people/donald-trump"},"related":[{}]},"relatedItems":{"items":[{"hed":"“This Administration Is Hoping This Will Blow Over”: The Foreign-Policy Community Loses Any Remaining Faith in Trump","promoHed":"“They’re Trying to Run the Table”: Experts Fear the Saudis Have Steamrolled Trump","dek":"Inside Washington, foreign-policy experts hoping for a reset swiftly downgraded their expectations.

For decades, a succession of U.S. presidents have disguised the brutal realpolitik of America’s relationship with Saudi Arabia under a patina of moral superiority and willful ignorance. Trump dispatched with the illusion entirely. “This took place in Turkey, and to the best of our knowledge, Khashoggi is not a United States citizen,” he told reporters, computing the value of Khashoggi’s life in real time. “He’s a permanent resident.” On the phone with Fox News, when asked about the possibility of canceling an arms deal with Riyadh, Trump was similarly forthright regarding the hard economic calculus. “I think that would be hurting us,” he said. “We have jobs. We have a lot of things happening in this country.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Inside Washington, foreign-policy experts hoping for a reset swiftly downgraded their expectations. And as the Khashoggi affair has played out, disappointment has morphed to cynicism within the diplomatic community. “It’s fairly clear that this administration is hoping this will blow over in some respect or another,” &lt;strong&gt;Peter Juul,&lt;/strong&gt; a senior policy analyst at the Center for American Progress, sighed in an interview. On Tuesday, Secretary of State &lt;strong&gt;Mike Pompeo&lt;/strong&gt; had made a perfunctory concession to critics by revoking the visas for some of the Saudi officials linked to Khashoggi’s death. But it was largely an empty gesture&amp;#8212;18 of the 21 Saudi suspects were already under arrest, and likely fated to die in a Saudi prison. (At least one of the men involved in the “hit team” had already [died in a mysterious &lt;a href=\"https://nypost.com/2018/10/18/saudi-who-arrived-in-turkey-day-of-khashoggi-disappearance-dies-in-traffic-accident/\"&gt;“traffic accident”&lt;/a&gt; upon returning to Riyadh.) “This was a perfect moment for Trump to step out and say, ‘We Americans reject this, because we believe in what we believe,” former U.S. ambassador &lt;strong&gt;Nicholas Burns,&lt;/strong&gt; said, incensed. “He missed it, because he doesn’t think about these things . . . I think we’re seeing the hollowness of his presidency. Truly. There’s no moral center to it.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Notably, many are sympathetic to the bind the Trump administration has found itself in. “To be fair, any administration of either party&amp;#8212;Trump, Obama, Bush, Clinton&amp;#8212;would have found this challenging,” Burns told me. “I don’t think there’s anybody out there, a senior person who’s worked in government, saying we should end our relationship with Saudi Arabia over this.” After all, Saudi Arabia is a critical U.S. ally&amp;#8212;from both a strategic and economic standpoint. The Saudis serve as an imperfect ally of Israel, and are seen as a check on Iranian hegemony in the Middle East. “To be honest, when it comes to tangible policy, another administration may not have been all that different than Trump,” &lt;strong&gt;John Glaser,&lt;/strong&gt; the director of foreign policy at the Cato Institute, told me. “A typical administration would almost certainly have been more critical of the Saudis following the Khashoggi murder, but probably gently so. With the exception of some symbolic penalties&amp;#8212;formal condemnations, calls for investigation, possibly a temporary suspension of arms sales&amp;#8212;the U.S.-Saudi relationship would probably not be fundamentally altered.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It is too early to tell whether Khashoggi’s murder has brought the U.S. establishment to a tipping point. Over the past weeks, both Republican and Democratic lawmakers have voiced frustration with Saudi Arabia, its war in Yemen, and the Saudi regime’s apparent disregard for America’s multi-billion-dollar patronage. But Washington is also awash in Saudi money, which funds dozens of think tanks, P.R. and consulting firms, and provides sinecures for all manner of Swamp creatures. The Trump administration, certainly, has yet to telegraph any interest in altering its relationship with Riyadh, let alone with Crown Prince &lt;strong&gt;Mohammed bin Salman,&lt;/strong&gt; who has a close personal connection with &lt;strong&gt;Jared Kushner.&lt;/strong&gt; If there was a window for Trump to exert his leverage over Saudi Arabia&amp;#8212;a desert economy with a singular, but depleting, natural resource&amp;#8212;he missed the opportunity. Nor did he bother to engage with the European Union or NATO allies, as past administrations likely would have done, signaling the extent to which “America First” has also come to mean “America Alone.” Meanwhile, Juul lamented, the Saudis are “very much all in on Trump. They’re trying to see what they can get away with in however long he’s in office. They’re trying to run the table.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thomas Lippman,&lt;/strong&gt; who served as the Middle East bureau chief for &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post,&lt;/em&gt; put it more succinctly. “The crown prince is clearly going to brazen it out. There is not going to be any fundamental rupture in relations between Saudi Arabia and the United States,” he said. “I am not saying that people are not upset about it. I am saying that on the scale of grievances that Saudi Arabia and the United States have had over the past 75 years, this too shall pass.” Lippman, the author of &lt;em&gt;Saudi Arabia on the Edge&lt;/em&gt;, noted with dismay the limits of America’s historical memory, and the sins that are excused in the name of global stability. “Nothing that happened to Jamal Khashoggi is in the same ballpark as the death of the collective outrage in the United States over 9/11. And it did not lead to even a temporary rupture of economic and strategic relations with Saudi Arabia.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the White House attempts to move on, the diplomatic community has turned to Congress. “I think if there’s going to be any movement on it, it’s going to come from Congress,” Juul said. Outrage on Capitol Hill quickly eclipsed the White House’s glacial response as grisly details of Khashoggi’s death became public in the week since Khashoggi disappeared inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on October 2. “We deal with bad people all the time, but this is in our face,” South Carolina Senator &lt;strong&gt;Lindsey Graham,&lt;/strong&gt; a traditionally staunch defender of the U.S.-Saudi relationship, said during an interview with &lt;em&gt;Fox &amp;amp; Friends,&lt;/em&gt; urging the president to “sanction the hell out of Saudi Arabia.” Such indignation spans the aisle. As one congressional aide &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/mike-pompeo-jamal-khashoggi-saudi-arabia\"&gt;told me&lt;/a&gt; last week, “Across the Hill, there is just absolute disgust at what seems to have taken place.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What Congress will do, if anything, remains unclear. Sending a strong bipartisan message to the White House, 22 senators released a letter that triggered the Global Magnitsky Act, requiring the administration to open an investigation into the circumstances surrounding Khashoggi’s murder and issue a report on whether it will sanction the individuals involved. But Congress cannot force Trump to sanction anyone under the act. “All they can do is call for a report from the executive, and kind of potentially embarrass the executive if they choose not to impose those sanctions,” said &lt;strong&gt;Jarrett Blanc,&lt;/strong&gt; a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment who previously served in the State Department. “That is certainly what they are doing so far.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There are other areas, however, where Congress has greater leverage. For instance, any future U.S. arms deals with the Saudis will require congressional sign-off, and lawmakers have broad authority over funding U.S. involvement in Saudi Arabia’s war in Yemen. “We could, bluntly, really end their war, depending on how far we want to push in terms of the different kinds of support that we provide, and not providing it,” Blanc said. “They could radically change policy in that area if they choose to.” To that end, a bipartisan group of lawmakers led by Congressman &lt;strong&gt;Jim McGovern&lt;/strong&gt; have introduced a bill that would ban all arms sales and military cooperation with Saudi Arabia, effectively ending U.S. support for the war in Yemen. Last week, Senator &lt;strong&gt;Jack Reed,&lt;/strong&gt; the ranking Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said the U.S. should block all offensive arms sales to Saudi Arabia and that the U.S. military should stop refueling Saudi aircraft fighting in Yemen.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Criticizing the war in Yemen, a proxy battle with Iran, is not necessarily new ground for some members of Congress, but the Khashoggi affair could catalyze change. As a second Congressional aide explained to me, “There is a sort of backlash around this&amp;#8212;based on the media coverage and, sort of, the interest in Congress&amp;#8212;that is unusual, and would seem to be sort of pushing the needle a little bit, maybe.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But with Congress on recess until after the November midterms, there is a concern that any momentum could fade. “The timing is unfortunate. The lame duck is unfortunate,” the second Congressional aide said. “But I do think that the level of public pressure on the administration is important. Hopefully, if for no other reason than it’s the right thing to do. People should be outraged about this.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For now, the White House is stuck with Mohammed bin Salman, a monster of its own making. “He has been really successful in doing one thing, I think that may be his only real success. He has eliminated all competition and gave no other alternative to himself,” &lt;strong&gt;Ali Al-Ahmed,&lt;/strong&gt; a Saudi dissident and founder and director of the Institute for Gulf Affairs, told me. “That is reality. You like him or not, that is a fact. There is no one.” The big question for the Trump administration is what will its relationship with Saudi Arabia look like moving forward, knowing that M.B.S. isn’t going anywhere anytime soon. “That is, to me, the long-term question we have to ask ourselves,” a former high-ranking State Department official told me. “Regardless of how this story plays out, regardless of how the narrative eventually evolves. Do we have a partner in Saudi Arabia on whom we can depend to conduct himself and the affairs of his nation in that mature, thoughtful, careful way?”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;","rubric":"Foreign Policy","socialTitle":"“They’re Trying to Run the Table”: Experts Fear the Saudis Have Steamrolled Trump","socialDescription":"Inside Washington, foreign-policy experts hoping for a reset swiftly downgraded their expectations.

Trump&lt;/strong&gt; has never needed a &lt;em&gt;reason&lt;/em&gt; to lie, considering alternative truths just come so naturally to him. But with less than a week until midterm elections that Republicans are expected to lose, he’s gotten increasingly brazen about his “&lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/the-mooch-trump-not-a-liar-just-a-connoisseur-of-mistruth\"&gt;methodology of mistruth&lt;/a&gt;,” specifically as it relates to a migrant caravan made up of asylum seekers moving toward the U.S. In the past month, the president has &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1054351078328885248\"&gt;claimed&lt;/a&gt; with no evidence that “criminals and unknown Middle Easterners are mixed” in with the group; suggested that a caravan of mostly women and children fleeing violence and planning to surrender at a port of entry is such a grave threat that it necessitates dispatching thousands of U.S. troops to the border; and spread the quite obviously false rumor that liberal financier &lt;strong&gt;George Soros&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/donald-trump-george-soros-caravan\"&gt;is paying these people&lt;/a&gt;. And in an &lt;a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wall-people-trump-defends-military-presence-border/story?id=58878290\"&gt;interview with ABC News&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday night, he trotted out some new gems, telling chief White House correspondent &lt;strong&gt;Jonathan Karl&lt;/strong&gt; that:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Contrary to reports that the caravan is mostly made up of women and children fleeing violence and poverty, “It’s actually mostly men . . . mostly young men. And a lot of rough people. They’re pushing the women right up into the front&amp;#8212;not good&amp;#8212;and they’re pushing the few kids right up to the front,” and making them pose for the cameras;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The caravan is much bigger than has been reported, which the president says he knows, because “I’m pretty good at estimating crowd size” (fact-check: &lt;a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-lying-crowd-sizes-rally-1183076\"&gt;he’s not&lt;/a&gt;), and “I will tell you: they look a lot bigger than people would think”;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A group of people planning to surrender at the border and ask for amnesty through the proper legal channels is no different than a hostile invasion from a foreign country. “They can’t invade our country,” Trump told Karl. “You look at that, it almost looks like an invasion. It really &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; look like an invasion . . . When you look at some of the people within the caravan&amp;#8212;yeah, I think it could be considered an invasion of our country. We can’t have it”; and&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Sending the military to the border, where they can’t make arrests, will serve a purpose other than a giant political stunt.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Mysteriously, the number of troops that Trump insists are very, very necessary keeps &lt;a href=\"https://apnews.com/5ce2a5b8ed2c4f4d950b422c9723de46\"&gt;shifting&lt;/a&gt; every time the president opens his mouth. As recently as Tuesday, the Air Force general running the show shot down reports that as many as 14,000 troops will be deployed, saying the number was “not consistent with what’s actually being planned.” But the military was caught by surprise again after Trump told reporters on Wednesday that the number could be “anywhere between 10 [thousand] and 15,000.” (That’s about how many U.S. troops are &lt;a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/immigration-border-crisis/map-us-troop-deployments-worldwide-mexico-border-military-n926786\"&gt;currently in Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;.) The Pentagon released a statement saying “the number of troops deployed will change each day as military forces flow into the operating area, but the initial estimate is that the DOD will have more than 7,000 troops supporting DHS across California, Arizona, and Texas”&amp;#8212;about half the number Trump suggested.

along with &lt;strong&gt;Melania, Ivanka,&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Jared,&lt;/strong&gt; traveled to Pittsburgh following Saturday’s mass shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue. A visit by a sitting president in the wake of a devastating event is, of course, fairly standard and often welcomed&amp;#8212;&lt;strong&gt;Barack Obama,&lt;/strong&gt; for example, &lt;a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2012/12/16/167412995/transcript-president-obama-at-sandy-hook-prayer-vigil\"&gt;spoke&lt;/a&gt; at a vigil in Newtown, Connecticut, two days after the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary school, &lt;a href=\"https://www.ctpost.com/local/article/The-president-comes-to-comfort-Newtown-4122455.php\"&gt;comforting&lt;/a&gt; the families that had just suffered an unthinkable tragedy. In this case, however, things were a little different! On Monday, Mayor &lt;strong&gt;Bill Peduto&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/pittsburgh-mayor-sends-message-to-trump-do-not-come-during-funerals\"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; he had tried to “get a message out to the White House” that it would be better if the president stayed in Washington, while thousands of people signed signed &lt;a href=\"https://www.bendthearc.us/open_letter_to_president_trump\"&gt;a letter&lt;/a&gt; written by a Jewish group based in Pittsburgh telling Trump he wasn’t welcome. That probably had something to do with the fact that the president &lt;a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-pennsylvania-shooting-trump-remarks/trump-says-pittsburgh-shooting-has-little-to-do-with-gun-laws-idUSKCN1N10M3\"&gt;blamed the victims&lt;/a&gt; following the attack, insisting that the shooting had nothing to do with gun laws and that “If they had some kind of a protection inside the temple maybe it could have been a very much different situation.” That the president has refused to disavow white nationalist and anti-Semites, and, some say, &lt;a href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/radio/thecurrent/the-current-for-august-14-2017-1.4244057/trump-has-emboldened-white-nationalists-with-racist-policies-says-author-1.4246077\"&gt;emboldened&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/08/the-battle-that-erupted-in-charlottesville-is-far-from-over/567167/\"&gt;them&lt;/a&gt;, may also have been a contributing factor.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Trump has never been one to take a hint, and chose instead to ignore the pleas of a grieving community. That resulted, unsurprisingly, in &lt;a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/congressional-leaders-decline-to-join-trump-in-visit-to-pittsburgh-after-massacre/2018/10/30/34709010-dc4e-11e8-aa33-53bad9a881e8_story.html\"&gt;protests&lt;/a&gt;, at least one victim’s family refusing to meet with him, and dismay on the parts of local officials who said the community “didn’t think this was the time for a political photo shoot,” especially given “the divisive nature of [the president’s] rhetoric.” But as far as Trump is concerned, the visit was a rousing success! Because from his vantage point, he was treated with the deference and respect he thinks he deserves, and didn’t have to personally witness anyone telling him to GTFO, which &lt;a

Not from, say, &lt;a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-tariffs-trade-war-layoffs-business-losses-2018-8\"&gt;job-killing trade wars&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"http://www.nhpr.org/post/pittsburgh-synagogue-shooting-called-domestic-terrorism\"&gt;domestic terrorists&lt;/a&gt;, but something much scarier: a “caravan” of migrants traveling north toward the U.S. border. Earlier in the month, the president claimed, with &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/white-house-staff-can-barely-keep-up-with-trump-lies\"&gt;zero evidence&lt;/a&gt;, that “criminals and unknown Middle Easterners are mixed in” with groups of Central Americans seeking refuge in America. Over the weekend, he attempted to heighten the drama by ordering thousands of troops to the border&amp;#8212;a wildly transparent political ploy, considering the caravan is weeks away and those in it plan to surrender and apply for amnesty. Now, with exactly a week until the election, Trump has lobbed a Hail Mary that he clearly hopes will convince voters that Republicans like him are the only thing standing between them and a United States in which every undocumented immigrant gets to kick an American out of their house: a bald-faced lie about how he’s going to issue a (likely unconstitutional!) executive order to end “birthright citizenship.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In a promo for &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt; on HBO, Trump said, “We’re the only country in the world where a person comes in and has a baby, and the baby is essentially a citizen of the United States . . . with all of those benefits,” which is only the first lie of the two-minute clip (More than thirty countries provide birthright citizenship.) Telling host &lt;strong&gt;Jonathan Swan&lt;/strong&gt; that the concept is “ridiculous,” Trump added that while “it was always told to me that you need a constitutional amendment [to get rid of it]” (true), in turns out “you don’t” (false), and claimed the president has the power to end the practice via executive order. &lt;a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-birthright-citizenship-14th-amendment-experts-2018-10\"&gt;Out here in reality, though&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In the U.S., birthright citizenship is enshrined in the 14th Amendment to the Constitution, which says: “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;“Trump has zero authority to amend the Constitution through executive fiat, and he certainly can’t do it with a tweet,” &lt;strong&gt;Matthew Kolken,&lt;/strong&gt; an immigration attorney in Buffalo, New York, told Business Insider on Tuesday. Kolken added that it would be “virtually impossible” to amend the Constitution in today’s political climate. Amendments require either a two-thirds majority vote in both the House of Representatives and the Senate or a constitutional convention called for by two-thirds of State legislatures.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;While some conservatives like to &lt;a href=\"https://www.axios.com/trump-birthright-citizenship-executive-order-0cf4285a-16c6-48f2-a933-bd71fd72ea82.html\"&gt;claim&lt;/a&gt; that the 14th Amendment was only supposed to provide citizenship to babies born in the U.S. to lawful permanent residents&amp;#8212;an argument Vice President &lt;strong&gt;Mike Pence&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/politico/status/1057290978900492290\"&gt;articulated&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday morning&amp;#8212;experts predict that not even a Supreme Court stocked with two judges handpicked by President Law and Order is likely to go for such an argument. “I think the 14th Amendment is clear in enshrining birthright citizenship in the law, and there is interpretive case law from the Supreme Court supporting this,” &lt;strong&gt;Greg Siskind,&lt;/strong&gt; an immigration lawyer, told Business Insider. “Even with a conservative Supreme Court, I have faith the Court will reject this extremist act.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Still, others predict that there could be some wiggle room. Constitutional scholar &lt;strong&gt;John Eastman&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.axios.com/trump-birthright-citizenship-executive-order-0cf4285a-16c6-48f2-a933-bd71fd72ea82.html\"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; Axios that the amendment originally referred to green-card holders and citizens. If Trump follows through on his threat, he said, “the courts would have to weigh in in a way they haven’t.” For Trump, though, actually having the power to end birthright citizenship and convincing the base he does are two very separate things. It doesn’t much matter if he’s lying through his caps, as long as they believe him, which they &lt;a

And, as he did in 2016, he is again pushing the limits of what passes for acceptable political discourse. On Thursday, in what is effectively his closing argument for the midterm election, Trump &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1057728445386539008\"&gt;shared&lt;/a&gt; a new advertisement, produced by his campaign, that accuses Democrats of encouraging an invasion of violent immigrants and cop-killers to enter the United States illegally.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The ad, which was quickly condemned by Democrats, contains footage from the trial of &lt;strong&gt;Luis Bracamontes,&lt;/strong&gt; who was sentenced to death this year for &lt;a href=\"https://www.sacbee.com/news/local/crime/article209616134.html\"&gt;killing two police officers&lt;/a&gt;, smiling as he boasts that he will “kill more cops soon,” interspersed with video of the migrant caravan marching across Central America. In one clip, a translator relays to Fox News that a migrant is trying to escape justice. It closes with a question: “Who else would Democrats let in?”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"&gt;&lt;blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1057728445386539008\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1057728445386539008\"&gt;https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1057728445386539008&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 53-second Web video is being compared to the infamous Willie Horton campaign ad, which appeared in the middle of the heated 1988 presidential election. That ad, which is frequently held up as the &lt;em&gt;ne plus ultra&lt;/em&gt; of racist fear mongering in political advertising, highlighted a rape committed by Horton, a black man, after he was furloughed from prison under Massachusetts Governor &lt;strong&gt;Michael Dukakis,&lt;/strong&gt; the Democratic presidential nominee. But of course, that ad was merely financed by supporters of the &lt;strong&gt;George H.W. Bush&lt;/strong&gt; campaign. The Bracamontes ad, which is effectively the same tactic on steroids, with none of the subtlety, was developed by the Trump campaign and tweeted by the president himself.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The ad is the loudest in a series of racist dog whistles by the president in the closing weeks of the midterm election cycle. Last month, Trump explained that his campaign talking points would focus on “&lt;a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/412172-trump-midterms-a-referendum-on-kavanaugh-the-caravan-law-and-order\"&gt;Kavanaugh; the caravan; law and order; and common sense&lt;/a&gt;.” But as Republican odds of holding onto the House &lt;a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/2018_generic_congressional_vote-6185.html\"&gt;have slipped&lt;/a&gt;, the president refined his message to focus on the most xenophobic elements animating the conservative base. In recent days, he ordered thousands of troops to defend the southern border, provoking accusations that he is using the U.S. military as a political prop. (“Increasing troops for a nonexistent crisis is a racist ploy and an irresponsible waste of resources,” &lt;strong&gt;Shaw Drake,&lt;/strong&gt; policy counsel for the A.C.L.U., &lt;a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/oct/31/trump-migrant-caravan-immigration-us-troops-mexico\"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;) On Tuesday, Axios published an interview in which Trump discussed &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/the-intellectual-origins-of-trumps-chilling-immigration-plan\"&gt;repealing birthright citizenship&lt;/a&gt;, a right enshrined in the 14th Amendment of the Constitution, which legal experts say would be impossible. The following day, pouring conspiratorial accelerant on the fire, he told reporters he “wouldn’t be surprised” if billionaire &lt;strong&gt;George Soros&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#8212;a Jewish philanthropist who is an obsession of anti-Semites and was recently the target of a mail-bomb plot&amp;#8212;was secretly funding the caravan. Throughout, his Twitter feed has remained a reliable dumping ground for &lt;a href=\"https://www.mediaite.com/online/trump-ramps-up-fear-mongering-caravans-made-up-of-very-bad-thugs-and-gang-members/\"&gt;random musings&lt;/a&gt; about the “very bad thugs and gang members,” as well as the “&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1054351078328885248\"&gt;criminals and unknown Middle Easterners&lt;/a&gt;,” he claims are interspersed throughout the caravan.)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Trump may be the primary vector for nativist fear, but his supporters have been more than willing to spread his ravings, or even to outdo them&amp;#8212;Fox News hosts and guests have proposed that the caravan is riddled with &lt;a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/fox-and-friends-host-brian-kilmeade-fears-diseases-brought-by-migrant-caravan\"&gt;diseases&lt;/a&gt; like &lt;a href=\"https://www.mediaite.com/tv/fox-news-guest-claims-migrant-caravan-will-infect-americans-with-leprosy-host-issues-correction/\"&gt;leprosy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/fox-news-commentator-says-migrants-are-carrying-smallpox-a-disease-eradicated-in-1980\"&gt;smallpox&lt;/a&gt;, and, as one guest on &lt;strong&gt;Lou Dobbs’s&lt;/strong&gt; Fox Business show claimed, a “&lt;a href=\"https://www.mediaite.com/online/lou-dobbs-guest-baselessly-claims-migrant-invasion-is-spreading-disease-causing-polio-like-paralysis-in-childr\"&gt;polio-like paralysis&lt;/a&gt;” in children. To Trump’s mind, this is all according to plan. But at least two factors may ultimately weigh against him. First, his racist appeals are more pointed than ever before, surpassing even his rhetoric in 2016. Second, a variety of factors tripped up &lt;strong&gt;Hillary Clinton&lt;/strong&gt; in the final weeks of the campaign, not the least of which was &lt;strong&gt;James Comey’s&lt;/strong&gt; letter. But if Trump is aware of these facts, he appears to be ignoring them, going all in on a strategy derived from his gut. Gallup polling &lt;a href=\"https://www.newsmax.com/politics/gallup-trump-poll-approval/2018/10/29/id/888500/\"&gt;shows&lt;/a&gt; that Trump’s approval rating has plunged 4 points in the last week. As he descends into the political muck, will he drag the Republican Party down with him?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;More Great Stories from &lt;em&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212; Why Fox doesn’t have much of a choice &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/inside-trumps-new-fox-takeover?mbid=inline\"&gt;when it comes to Trump&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212; How long can Mark Zuckerberg keep &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/how-long-can-mark-zuckerberg-convince-teens-that-instagram-is-cool?mbid=inline\"&gt;convincing teens that Instagram is cool?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212; Is the Trump administration ever going to &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/donald-trump-jamal-khashoggi-saudi-arabia?mbid=inline\"&gt;hold Saudi Arabia to account?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212; Why working at Netflix &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/working-at-netflix-sounds-absolutely-terrifying?mbid=inline\"&gt;sounds terrifying&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212; Amazon’s flirtation with ICE &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/theyre-playing-both-sides-bezoss-flirtation-with-ice-appalls-amazon-employees?mbid=inline\"&gt;appalls its workers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Looking for more? &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/newsletters\"&gt;Sign up&lt;/a&gt; for our daily Hive newsletter and never miss a story.&lt;/p&gt;","rubric":"2018 Midterm Elections","socialTitle":"Trump’s Midterm Closing Argument: Pure Racial Fear","socialDescription":"In the last week of the campaign, the president is tripling down on his anti-immigrant message with a 21st-century version of the racist Willie Horton ad.

decidedly in Le Pen’s favor.","body":"&lt;p&gt;The window for &lt;strong&gt;Emmanuel Macron&lt;/strong&gt; to forestall the rise of the far right in France may now be closing. When he was &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/05/macron-france-election-victory\"&gt;elected&lt;/a&gt; over &lt;strong&gt;Marine Le Pen&lt;/strong&gt; in May 2017, Macron won the opportunity to prove that his program of &lt;a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2017/04/24/the-radical-centrism-of-emmanuel-macron/\"&gt;“radical centrism”&lt;/a&gt; could unite the country, turbocharge a sclerotic labor market, cut red tape, slim the national budget, and reform the European Union. But the politics of Le Pen, a populist-nationalist in the mode of &lt;strong&gt;Donald Trump,&lt;/strong&gt; were not defeated, merely quiescent. The electoral turnout had been low, for France, at 75 percent, and many voters punched their ticket for Macron only to block Le Pen. While Macron won the runoff election with two-thirds of the vote, political observers predicted that voters would not be patient with the 40-year-old banker’s newly formed party, En Marche. The countdown began.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Some 18 months later, a new poll confirms that the battle for the French republic, torn between nativism and globalism, is trending in Le Pen’s favor. According to an &lt;a href=\"https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-eu-parliament-france/french-far-right-overtakes-macron-in-eu-parliament-election-poll-idUKKCN1N9043?il=0\"&gt;Ifop survey&lt;/a&gt; published Sunday, France’s far-right Rassemblement National Party has moved ahead of En Marche for the first time in polling ahead of the May 2019 European Parliament elections. About 1,000 French people were asked how they would vote if the parliamentary election were held next Sunday: 19 percent indicated they would support Macron, down from 20 percent at the end of August, while 21 percent signaled support for Le Pen, up from 17 percent. With a further 9 percent delineating support for smaller populist and so-called “Frexit” parties, the far-right vote totaled 30 percent&amp;#8212;a substantial five-point gain since this summer.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Le Pen’s creeping resurgence mirrors Macron’s sagging popularity, which has hit &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/emmanuel-macron-plans-self-care-staycation-as-his-poll-numbers-collapse\"&gt;record lows&lt;/a&gt; amid accusations that he is &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/emmanuel-macron-tells-the-french-to-stop-complaining\"&gt;arrogant and out-of-touch&lt;/a&gt;, and that his reform packages, intended to juice the French economy, have solely benefited the rich. The latest gripe the French have with Macron is over &lt;a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-11-05/as-gas-price-at-pump-heads-north-macron-popularity-turns-south\"&gt;rising gas prices&lt;/a&gt;; truckers and drivers plan to block traffic across the country as part of nationwide protests on November 17.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Macron’s loss of domestic support should not effect the implementation of his increasingly controversial reforms, for now. It will, however, impact the upcoming parliamentary elections, which, morphing into a proxy war between pro-Europeans and nationalist-populists, may well determine the future of the European Union, especially now that the bloc is &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/will-angela-merkels-exit-begin-the-bannonization-of-europe\"&gt;set to lose&lt;/a&gt; its &lt;em&gt;de facto&lt;/em&gt; leader, &lt;strong&gt;Angela Merkel.&lt;/strong&gt; Aware of the election’s grave stakes, Macron has been hoping to bolster his support by styling himself as the arbiter of innovative centrism. As Politico &lt;a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/france-president-emmanuel-macron-steps-up-eu-power-play-with-pitch-to-liberals/\"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;, this week he is discharging party officials to the Madrid congress of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE), to try and broker a joint platform with the group that would echo the vision he had for France by undercutting established forces on both sides of the political spectrum, and championing integrated globalism.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If Macron succeeds in forging this alliance, and then manages to drum up the support of voters to establish the second-largest group in European Parliament, his influence in Brussels would enjoy a symbolic spike. But if French voters fail to get on board, he risks alienating potential allies in Brussels, and emboldening the march of Le Pen and Europe’s populists, who are also eyeing the elections as an unprecedented opportunity to shape, or destabilize, the E.U. over the next five years.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The looming battle over the E.U. comes at an augural moment for Europe, as the continent prepares to mark the centenary of the close of the First World War, and reflects on the forces that tore it asunder. In a timely interview with &lt;em&gt;Ouest-France,&lt;/em&gt; published last Wednesday, Macron encouraged voters to “resist” incendiary politics that recall the crucible of the 1920s. “Europe is facing a risk: that of dismemberment through nationalist leprosy and being pushed over by external powers, and therefore to lose its sovereignty,” he said, warning that a fractured Europe would risk “having its security dependent on American choices and changes, a growing presence in China on essential infrastructures, a Russia that is sometimes tempted by manipulation as well as big financial interest.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For those French voters who have not experienced the uplift they were promised, Macron’s bold rhetoric will ring hollow. Clearly, Macron needs to shed his elitist image, and get them back on his side. To do so, he should look toward the resurgence of Le Pen. Her triumph in the poll proves her appeal did not dissipate with the ascendance of Macron. But, more important, it shows that the French president has not made the necessary efforts to understand the economic and cultural alienation that have fueled far-right movements across Europe and the Americas while he has been in power. It’s not enough to urge voters not to stray from the center&amp;#8212;Macron must also offer reassurance beyond polished speeches. Otherwise, in his efforts to stop the far right, he looks fated to slip into the same patterns as his counterparts in the U.S., and seed its continued rise.&lt;/p&gt;","rubric":"France","socialTitle":"Marine Le Pen, the Donald Trump of France, Is Resurgent","socialDescription":"As Emmanuel Macron’s popularity sags, a new poll confirms that the

Trump doesn’t seem to care&amp;#8212;and is already preparing a 2020 message that posits him as savior.","body":"&lt;p&gt;“Heading into a bad cycle, a politician’s most powerful instinct is to point to somebody else,” former White House press secretary &lt;strong&gt;Ari Fleischer&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/10/29/midterm-elections-2018-gop-blame-game-finger-pointing-ahead-midterm-elections/1764399002/\"&gt;observed&lt;/a&gt; last week, summarizing the upcoming midterm elections, in which Democrats are expected to retake the House and launch a &lt;a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2018-midterm-elections-republicans-preparation-investigations-180abf7b-0de8-4670-ae8a-2e6da123c584.html\"&gt;campaign of terror&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;strong&gt;Donald Trump.&lt;/strong&gt; If Republicans prevail, Fleischer added, “they’re all gonna be saying, ‘We saw it coming all along.’” But vanishingly few strategists are optimistic about their chances, if the pre-election spin cycle is any indication.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;G.O.P. insiders have predicted a &lt;a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2017/12/21/2018-midterms-republicans-trump-warning-312404\"&gt;2018 bloodbath&lt;/a&gt; since last year, given Trump’s extraordinarily low approval rating and the historical tendency of midterm voters to boost whichever party is out of power. The polls tightened after the &lt;strong&gt;Brett Kavanaugh&lt;/strong&gt; confirmation battle, which energized the conservative base, but Trump traded newfound goodwill among moderates for base activation with his &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/11/donald-trump-luis-bracamontes-midterm-ad\"&gt;frenzied, racially charged attacks&lt;/a&gt; on immigrants. “Trump has hijacked the election,” a senior Republican House aide &lt;a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2018/11/04/trump-2018-elections-midterms-republicans-immigration-960748\"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; Politico on Sunday, referring to the president’s obsession with making the midterm a referendum on the caravan. “This is not what we expected the final weeks of the election to focus on.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The immigration issue may indeed fire up some portion of conservatives in rural red states, especially in Senate races that might otherwise have been a toss-up. But over in the House, Republicans fear that Trump’s racially tinged closing argument has alienated suburban swing voters and distracted from a booming economy and record-low unemployment rate:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Indeed, some House Republicans say privately that they feel abandoned, as if Trump has given up on them&amp;#8212;the likely losers&amp;#8212;in order to focus on the Senate. Rubbing salt in the wound, they feel Trump’s message to help Senate Republicans in rural, red states is a direct threat to the House G.O.P.’s cause in suburban areas.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;“His honing in on this message is going to cost us seats,” said one senior House G.O.P. campaign source. “The people we need to win in these swing districts that will determine the majority, it’s not the Trump base; it’s suburban women, or people who voted for &lt;strong&gt;[Hillary] Clinton&lt;/strong&gt; or people who are not hard Trump voters.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Trump doesn’t seem to care. On a phone call Sunday, Politico &lt;a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2018/11/04/trump-2018-elections-midterms-republicans-immigration-960748\"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;, retiring House Speaker &lt;strong&gt;Paul Ryan&lt;/strong&gt; made a final entreaty for the president to focus his energies on economic issues, such as last year’s tax cut, which have juiced financial markets. But Trump countered that immigration would do more to fire up the base. As he explained publicly during a recent rally in Florida&amp;#8212;one of a dozen campaign stops he has made over the past weeks&amp;#8212;he wants voters to make their decision with one thing in mind: the caravan. “We can talk about the economy, but the fact is, we know how well we’re doing with the economy and we have to solve problems,” Trump said Friday. At another rally, on Wednesday, he specifically singled out the Washington conventional wisdom about suburban women as a myth: “I don’t view suburban districts or any other districts, I view the country,” he said. “Our country has to be safe. And by the way, women, we’re doing very well with the women vote because they want security, they want safety.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Congress and the White House are not only squaring off over the efficacy of this message, but also jockeying to avoid blame if it fails. In an &lt;a href=\"https://www.apnews.com/8f4baf7aaddc442dad0a726f3ebe7fff\"&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; with the Associates Press last month, Trump waved away the argument that his presence on the campaign trail might hurt some Republicans down-ticket. “No, I think I’m helping people,” he said. “I don’t believe anybody’s ever had this kind of an impact.” But he also seemed to anticipate the possibility that his voters wouldn’t turn out. “I mean, there are many people that have said to me . . . ‘I will never ever go and vote in the midterms because you’re not running and I don’t think you like Congress,’” he explained. Plenty of Republicans involved in the House re-election effort object to that logic. A G.O.P. operative working with congressional races around the country &lt;a href=\"https://www.axios.com/republicans-little-confidence-house-midterm-elections-595bb2c4-aa4a-4d7d-bc42-623dc1093024.html\"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; Axios, “the president, him being undisciplined, and his low approval” will be responsible if the election shakes out as predicted.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Both sides may ultimately have to be content with “saving” the Senate, regardless of whether the president’s strategy is boosting the upper chamber at the expense of the House. &lt;strong&gt;Matt Schlapp,&lt;/strong&gt; who has a reliable conduit to the West Wing press shop thanks to his wife, White House Strategic Communications Director &lt;strong&gt;Mercedes Schlapp,&lt;/strong&gt; offered a variant of this talking point on Friday, telling Politico, “If the president picks up Senate seats, they’ll be no honest people talking about a ‘blue wave.’” G.O.P. consultant &lt;strong&gt;Brad Todd&lt;/strong&gt; made a similar argument, tuned to 2020: “A Republican gain in the Senate is a rebuke of &lt;strong&gt;Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris,&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Cory Booker.&lt;/strong&gt;” Another party insider, &lt;strong&gt;Barry Bennett,&lt;/strong&gt; who served as an adviser to Trump’s 2016 campaign, predicted that if Republicans hold the Senate, “that’s all they’ll talk about.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Of course, Republicans had the advantage in the Senate from the get-go, given that that 26 of the 35 seats up for election are held by Democrats. Trump surely understands that, but his political superpower isn’t modesty. “No matter what happens tomorrow, the president will find a datapoint&amp;#8212;or datapoints&amp;#8212;to declare victory,” &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/JakeSherman/status/1059460658893389824\"&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Jake Sherman,&lt;/strong&gt; relaying what Republicans say they fear about Tuesday. In other words, there will be no moment of reckoning, such as Obama experienced in 2010. If the House falls, Trump will point the finger at the Ryan and the lower chamber for not keeping the faith, take credit for an inevitable outcome in the Senate, and press forward into 2020 with a new argument&amp;#8212;and the same mandate.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;More Great Stories from &lt;em&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212; Why Fox doesn’t have much of a choice &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/inside-trumps-new-fox-takeover?mbid=inline\"&gt;when it comes to Trump&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212; How long can Mark Zuckerberg keep &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/how-long-can-mark-zuckerberg-convince-teens-that-instagram-is-cool?mbid=inline\"&gt;convincing teens that Instagram is cool?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212; Is the Trump administration ever going to &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/donald-trump-jamal-khashoggi-saudi-arabia?mbid=inline\"&gt;hold Saudi Arabia to account?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212; Why working at Netflix &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/working-at-netflix-sounds-absolutely-terrifying?mbid=inline\"&gt;sounds terrifying&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212; Amazon’s flirtation with ICE &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/theyre-playing-both-sides-bezoss-flirtation-with-ice-appalls-amazon-employees?mbid=inline\"&gt;appalls its workers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Looking for more? &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/newsletters\"&gt;Sign up&lt;/a&gt; for our daily Hive newsletter and never miss a story.&lt;/p&gt;","rubric":"2018 Midterm Elections","socialTitle":"Don’t Expect the Midterms to Humble Donald Trump","socialDescription":"Republican strategists warn that Trump is sacrificing the House to preserve a Senate majority that was never in doubt.

Special court privileges. Kicking homeowners out of their houses using eminent domain. Shifting large amounts of cash away from the public sector. Given the numerous ways in which Wisconsin politicians convinced electronics manufacturing giant Foxconn to build its first plant in the Badger State, you’d probably assume the payoff would be millions of jobs for local workers and a fantastical return on investment in the near-term. But you would think wrong! Instead, &lt;strong&gt;Donald Trump’s&lt;/strong&gt; “incredible” deal has &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/11/donald-trump-foxconn-scam\"&gt;turned out to be one of his biggest scams yet&lt;/a&gt;. And, apparently, the hits &lt;a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/foxconn-considers-bringing-chinese-personnel-to-wisconsin-as-u-s-labor-market-tightens-1541505600\"&gt;just keep coming&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Foxconn Technology Group is considering bringing in personnel from China to help staff a large facility under construction in southern Wisconsin as it struggles to find engineers and other workers in one of the tightest labor markets in the U.S. . . . Foxconn Chairman &lt;strong&gt;Terry Gou&lt;/strong&gt; is looking to company engineers in China to transfer, according to people familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A tight labor market is making recruiting a challenge. Unemployment in the state reached a record low earlier this year. At 3 percent in September, Wisconsin’s jobless rate is well below the national average, which hit 3.7 percent that month&amp;#8212;itself a 49-year low.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A tight labor market in which the economy is already minting roughly 200,000 jobs a month might’ve been one of the many reasons that throwing billions of dollars at a foreign company in the hopes of an investment &lt;em&gt;maybe&lt;/em&gt; panning out by &lt;a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/dispatch/did-scott-walker-and-donald-trump-deal-away-the-governors-race-to-foxconn\"&gt;2042 at the earliest&lt;/a&gt; wasn’t such a great idea in the first place. But despite Foxconn’s reported attempts to bring Chinese workers to Wisconsin, thus far said workers have taken a pass.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Some engineers have expressed reluctance to relocate to Wisconsin, which is less well-known to Chinese workers than U.S. tech hubs in California or New York.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;One engineer who declined to give his name said he wouldn’t want to move to a place he worried could be as cold as Harbin, a northern Chinese city known as “Ice City.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In a statement, Foxconn told &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; its “Wisconsin first commitment remains unchanged,” and, in another statement, that it is still committed to hiring 13,000 employees, the majority of which “will work on high-value production and engineering assignments and in the research and development field.” (Part of the initial pitch to Wisconsinites was, in fact, that the majority of the jobs would be of the middle-class manufacturing variety.)&lt;/p&gt;","rubric":"Dealmaker-in-Chief","socialTitle":"Oops: Trump’s Foxconn Deal Is Creating Wisconsin Jobs for

to the midterm elections at all, reports began to surface that &lt;strong&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#8212;who on &lt;em&gt;Monday&lt;/em&gt; was &lt;a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/29/us-plans-new-257-billion-china-tariff-wave-if-trump-xi-trade-talks-fail.html\"&gt;ready&lt;/a&gt; to slap tariffs on every single Chinese import&amp;#8212;had suddenly reached some kind of breakthrough with Beijing. On Thursday, the president &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1057997981922873344\"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; that he’d had a “long and very good conversation” with President &lt;strong&gt;Xi Jinping,&lt;/strong&gt; with “a heavy emphasis on trade,” and indicated things were “moving along nicely.” Later that night, articles appeared &lt;a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-11-02/trump-said-to-ask-cabinet-to-draft-possible-trade-deal-with-xi-jnzjeqx4\"&gt;claiming&lt;/a&gt; Trump “wants to reach an agreement on trade” with Xi when they meet at the Group of 20 summit in Argentina, and that he’d “asked key U.S. officials to begin drafting potential terms, according to four people familiar with the matter,” and on Friday, the &lt;em&gt;South China Morning Post&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/2171359/donald-trump-plans-meeting-plus-dinner-xi-jinping-after-g20\"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that Trump had &lt;em&gt;changed his travel plans&lt;/em&gt; to accomodate a “meeting plus dinner” with Xi, a sign, according to one source, that he was “keen to reach a deal.” All of this would obviously be very good, nay, great news given that markets are increasingly worried about a full-blown trade war and that, so far, the outcome of Trump’s tariffs-spree has involved &lt;a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2018/07/30/after-trumps-farmer-bailout-manufacturers-ask-what-about-us/?utm_term=.9668a6be81e0\"&gt;layoffs for American workers&lt;/a&gt;, U.S. companies &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/06/trump-harley-davidson-fatal-attraction\"&gt;shifting production abroad&lt;/a&gt;, bailout-necessitating &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/07/bailouts-for-all-industries-trump-screwed-would-cost-taxpayers-39-billion\"&gt;losses for farmers in Trump country&lt;/a&gt;, and the potential for thousands of new jobs &lt;a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/26/business/china-jobs-automobiles-trade-war.html\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;in China&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, markets &lt;a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/global-markets-rip-higher-on-reports-trump-is-ready-to-deal-with-china-2018-11\"&gt;soared&lt;/a&gt; on the news, and all those Trump supporters who’ve been burned by his tariffs presumably got that warm, cuddly feeling back about the president just four days before the midterms. Except, according to National Economic Council director &lt;strong&gt;Larry Kudlow,&lt;/strong&gt; the whole thing&amp;#8212;to borrow a phrase from the president&amp;#8212;is &lt;a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/02/kudlow-says-cabinet-was-not-asked-to-draw-up-trade-plan-for-china.html\"&gt;FAKE NEWS&lt;/a&gt;! “There’s no massive movement to deal with China,” Kudlow told CNBC on Friday, noting that though Trump’s conversation with Xi had been “&lt;a href=\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/economy/trump-says-that-a-deal-with-china-on-trade-is-getting-closer\"&gt;pleasant and positive&lt;/a&gt;,” little actual progress was made on trade. “We’re doing a normal, routine run-through of things that we’ve already put together and normal preparation,” he added, stating, “We’re not on the cusp of a deal.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;That, of course, didn’t stop Trump from &lt;a href=\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/economy/trump-says-that-a-deal-with-china-on-trade-is-getting-closer\"&gt;insisting&lt;/a&gt; to reporters after the interview that the Chinese “very much want to make a deal” and “we’re getting much closer to doing something,” which at least one investor says you can file under Complete and Utter Bulls--t. “I don’t buy the story for a second,” &lt;strong&gt;Michael Every,&lt;/strong&gt; head of Asia financial markets research at Rabobank in Hong Kong &lt;a href=\"http://fortune.com/2018/11/02/trump-trade-war-deal-china-midterm/\"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Fortune.&lt;/em&gt; “This seems a perfect way to ensure equities rally into election day, put Xi into a box in terms of what is expected of him and then have someone to blame when the deal then falls through.” And in &lt;a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/11/02/president-trump-has-made-false-or-misleading-claims-over-days/\"&gt;related news&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If President Trump’s torrent of words has seemed overwhelming of late, there’s a good reason for that: in the first nine months of his presidency, Trump made 1,318 false or misleading claims, an average of five a day. But in the seven weeks leading up the midterm elections, the president made 1,419 false or misleading claims&amp;#8212;an average of 30 a day.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you would like to receive the Levin Report in your inbox daily, &lt;a href=\"http://tinyletter.com/besslevin\"&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt; to subscribe.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Obama to Republicans: you’re welcome&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;“Right now Republicans are all, ‘Look the economy’s so good,’” the 44th president &lt;a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2018/11/02/obama-trump-economy-republicans-959046\"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; at a rally in Miami on Friday. “Where do you think that started? When did that start? They’re talking about how ‘Oh, look how many jobs we created.’ The economy created more jobs in the last 21 months that I was in office than it did in the 20 months after I left office. And at the time they were saying how terrible the economy was.” G.O.P.: ya burnt.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Judge calls out Trump for conflict-of-interest-riddled hotel, spending two-thirds of his day tweeting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It turns out that (1) owning a business that foreign governments and other parties looking to kiss the ring regularly patronize may, in fact, be a conflict of interest &lt;a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/judge-denies-trumps-request-for-stay-in-emoluments-case/2018/11/02/aa87611c-dec8-11e8-b3f0-62607289efee_story.html\"&gt;when one is president of the United States&lt;/a&gt; . . .&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A federal judge on Friday denied President Trump’s request to stay a lawsuit alleging he is in violation of the Constitution by doing business with foreign governments, a decision that paves the way for plaintiffs to seek information from his business as it relates to his D.C. hotel.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge &lt;strong&gt;Peter J. Messitte&lt;/strong&gt; in Greenbelt, Md., denied the Justice Department’s request that he pause the case in order to allow a higher court to intervene.

practically a matter of public record that &lt;strong&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/strong&gt; is a lifelong huckster who will do anything to make a buck. Days after the 2016 election he agreed to pay $25 million &lt;a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/10/politics/trump-university-settlement-finalized-trnd/index.html\"&gt;to settle&lt;/a&gt; three lawsuits against Trump University, a smoke-and-mirrors operation that made University of Phoenix look like Stanford, where instructors were given a “playbook” that &lt;a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-trump-university-20160531-snap-story.html\"&gt;included&lt;/a&gt; the name of a TrumpU employee to call “if an Attorney General arrives on the scene.” Before that, the ex-beauty pageant owner was slapping his name on everything from &lt;a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-products-that-disappeared-list-2018-4\"&gt;steaks to mattresses to cologne to deodorant&lt;/a&gt; in exchange for lucrative licensing fees. In June, the New York attorney general &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/06/trump-foundation-lawsuit\"&gt;sued&lt;/a&gt; him alleging “persistently illegal conduct” related to the Donald J. Trump Foundation, charging that the charity served as “little more than a checkbook for payments to not-for-profits from Mr. Trump or the Trump Organization,” a suit &lt;strong&gt;Amanda Miller,&lt;/strong&gt; a spokeswoman for the Trump Organization, called “politics at its very worst.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In addition to a willingness to do anything to enrich himself&amp;#8212;like, for instance, &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/donald-trump-fred-trump-taxes\"&gt;(allegedly) dodging taxes for decades&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8212;we’ve yet to see evidence that the president of the United States cares about anyone not related to him by blood or marriage, or possesses the sort of moral compass that would prevent normal people from engaging in activity that hurts others. (According to &lt;em&gt;The New York Times,&lt;/em&gt; the Trump family &lt;a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/10/02/us/politics/donald-trump-tax-schemes-fred-trump.html\"&gt;created&lt;/a&gt; a company in 1992 that not only allowed the family to siphon millions to Trump, his siblings, and a cousin, but also let them pad invoices so they could raise the rent on low-income tenants who were supposed to be protected by rent regulations. In a statement, &lt;strong&gt;Charles Harder,&lt;/strong&gt; a lawyer for Trump, told the &lt;em&gt;Times:&lt;/em&gt; “There was no fraud or tax evasion by anyone” and that such affairs were “handled by other Trump family members.”) So, really, it shouldn’t come as a surprise in the slightest that the president and his three adult children have been &lt;a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/29/nyregion/trump-acn-lawsuit.html\"&gt;accused&lt;/a&gt; of pushing investment scams on thousands of vulnerable Americans in exchange for “lavish” payments they conveniently failed to mention in their sales pitches.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Filed in federal court in Manhattan on Monday . . . the 160-page complaint alleges that Mr. Trump and his family received secret payments from three business entities in exchange for promoting them as legitimate opportunities, when in reality they were get-rich-quick schemes that harmed investors, many of whom were unsophisticated and struggling financially.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Those business entities were ACN, a telecommunications marketing company that paid Mr. Trump millions of dollars to endorse its products; the Trump Network, a vitamin marketing enterprise; and the Trump Institute, which the suit said offered “extravagantly priced multiday training seminars” on Mr. Trump’s real estate “secrets.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The four plaintiffs, who were identified only with pseudonyms like Jane Doe, depict the Trump Organization as a racketeering enterprise that defrauded thousands of people for years as the president turned from construction to licensing his name for profit. The suit also names &lt;strong&gt;Donald Trump Jr., Ivanka Trump,&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Eric Trump&lt;/strong&gt; as defendants.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Back in 2011, &lt;em&gt;New York&lt;/em&gt;’s &lt;strong&gt;Jessica Pressler&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://nymag.com/nymag/features/70831/\"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; about the vitamin venture, which included products like “Prime Essentials” and “Custom Essentials,” a line of snacks for kids called “Snazzle Snaxxs,” a diet program called “Silhouette Solutions,” and a skincare line called “BioCé Cosmeceuticals.” Like Trump University, vitamin marketers were well-versed in what to do on the off-chance someone suggested Donald Trump would &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt; attach his name to something less than entirely legal:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The people at the Trump Network are trained to defend against allegations that it’s a pyramid scheme. Toward the end of Izzo’s seminar, we break into pairs to practice what to say when potential invitees suggest the business is a pyramid scheme. My partner is Billy, a former Wall Street trader who has worked his way up to “diamond director,” one of the highest levels in the company. The levels are determined by the number of people you recruit and the amount of products you and your downline purchase. “What’s a pyramid scheme?” he asks me. “Like the food pyramid? Like the Catholic Church? What about where you work? If you ask me, corporate America is a pyramid scheme. All the people on the top make all the money. The people at the bottom are spinning their wheels.” Then he plays his Trump card: “You think Donald Trump would involve himself in a pyramid scheme?”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In fact: yes! We do! We can also believe that Trump, a &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/white-house-staff-can-barely-keep-up-with-trump-lies\"&gt;known&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/the-mooch-trump-not-a-liar-just-a-connoisseur-of-mistruth\"&gt;liar&lt;/a&gt;, allegedly told people they’d make so much money from these scams that they’d be able to quit their day jobs. &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/JuddLegum/status/1056942139521810437\"&gt;Per the suit&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Trump doubled down on his claim during in-person endorsements, going so far as to suggest ACN was risk-free. Onstage at ACN’s International Convention in Barcelona, Spain, in March 2011, Trump explained to the auditorium that: “A lot of the [ACN] people that I’ve met had their job for two or three years, and all of a sudden they started leaving out of their job and going full-time at ACN because they’re making more money with ACN. So I like it because it really takes the risk out. It takes a lot of the risk out of the decision.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Of course, for at least one plaintiff, that &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/JuddLegum/status/1056938204731969538\"&gt;wasn’t the case at all&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Plaintiff Jane Doe is a resident of California who works as a hospice caregiver. In 2014, Doe attended a meeting for prospective ACN recruits. As she listened to the presentations, Doe was skeptical and unpersuaded. But then she saw a promotional video prominently featuring Trump. Trump’s endorsement was the turning point. . . . Doe had no idea Trump was being paid lavishly for his endorsement&amp;#8212;the video made no mention of that. Doe joined ACN then and there. Despite her limited resources, Doe wrote a check for the $499 registration fee, in reliance on Trump’s endorsement. In the two years that followed, Doe paid thousands of dollars in fees and expenses to attend ACN events and host ACN meetings in an effort to succeed with the business. But, ultimately, she had extremely limited success&amp;#8212;she earned a single check for $38.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In a statement, &lt;strong&gt;Alan Garten,&lt;/strong&gt; a lawyer for the Trump Organization, said the allegations in the suit are meritless and should be paid no attention because the plaintiffs’ attorney fees are being funded by a nonprofit whose chairman is a Democratic donor. “This is clearly just another effort by opponents of the President to use the court system to advance a political agenda,” he told the &lt;em&gt;Times.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Roberta Kaplan&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Andrew Celli Jr.,&lt;/strong&gt; two lawyers for the plaintiffs, said “the case is being brought now because it is ready now,” and, to be fair, this isn’t the first time Trump has been accused of fraud. “This case connects the dots at the Trump Organization and involves systematic fraud that spanned more than a decade, involved multiple Trump businesses and caused tremendous harm to thousands of hardworking Americans,” the attorneys said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you would like to receive the Levin Report in your inbox daily, &lt;a href=\"http://tinyletter.com/besslevin\"&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt; to subscribe.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If Elon Musk could turn back time . . .&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;He’d &lt;a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/29/teslas-elon-musk-says-his-tweet-that-led-to-a-20-million-fine-was-worth-it.html\"&gt;still&lt;/a&gt; send that tweet that got him sued by the Securities and Exchange Commission:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Tesla Chief Executive &lt;strong&gt;Elon Musk&lt;/strong&gt; said the tweet that cost him and the company $20 million in fines each by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission was “worth it.” . . . The Securities and Exchange Commission in September charged Musk, 47, with misleading investors with tweets on August 7 that said he was considering taking Tesla private at $420 a share and had secured funding. The tweets had no basis in fact, and the ensuing market chaos hurt investors, regulators claimed.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The settlement also dictated that Musk must step down as chairman of the company he founded, but apparently you can’t put a price &lt;a href=\"https://news.avclub.com/elon-musks-dumb-420-joke-might-be-coming-back-to-bite-h-1828408088\"&gt;on weed jokes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trump is thinking his trade war could use some more tariffs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Next month, Donald Trump will meet with Chinese President &lt;strong&gt;Xi Jinping&lt;/strong&gt; on the sidelines of a Group of 20 summit in Buenos Aires, where they’ll discuss the escalating trade war started by Trump earlier this year. So far, neither side has backed down, and despite Trump’s insistence that trade wars are “good” and “easy to win,” thus far U.S. companies and consumers have paid &lt;a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2018/07/30/after-trumps-farmer-bailout-manufacturers-ask-what-about-us/?utm_term=.9668a6be81e0\"&gt;a lopsided amount of the price&lt;/a&gt;, while the president’s “trade policies” might actually create jobs &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/26/business/china-jobs-automobiles-trade-war.html\"&gt;in China&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; So what President Jobs, Jobs, Jobs is thinking is this situation could be vastly improved by introducing more tariffs. &lt;a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-29/u-s-said-to-plan-more-china-tariffs-if-trump-xi-meeting-fails\"&gt;Per Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The U.S. is preparing to announce by early December tariffs on all remaining Chinese imports if talks next month between presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping fail to ease the trade war, three people familiar with the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;An early December announcement of a new product list would mean the effective date&amp;#8212;after a 60-day public-comment period&amp;#8212;may coincide with China’s Lunar New Year holiday in early February. The list would apply to the imports from the Asian nation that aren’t already covered by previous rounds of tariffs&amp;#8212;which may be $257 billion using last year’s import figures, according to two of the people.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Over the weekend, Trump told supporters in Indiana, “We’re in the middle of a pretty nasty dispute. . . . We’re in a trade dispute&amp;#8212;I want to use that word because it’s a nice, soft word&amp;#8212;but we’re going to win. You know why? ’Cause we always win.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;U.S. tax cuts working out exactly as corporate American said they would&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Which is to say, they’ve had little to no effect on most companies’ &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/TimJHanrahan/status/930481095988170757\"&gt;investment and hiring plans&lt;/a&gt;, in spite of the promises made by Republicans and the White House, &lt;a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e9bccd00-db98-11e8-8f50-cbae5495d92b\"&gt;according to a survey released today&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The National Association for Business Economics found buoyant conditions in the third quarter of 2018, with its members reporting rising sales and improved profit margins, but reported that the Republican tax reform “has not broadly impacted hiring and investment plans.” The survey, conducted between September 26 and October 11, adds to a growing body of evidence that much of the windfall from tax reform has been spent on share buybacks rather than investment, jobs, or research and development. Republicans had predicted their changes to the tax code would trigger a boom in corporate investment and hiring, particularly in the U.S. On the day he signed the bill into law, Mr Trump said: “It’s going to be a tremendous thing for the American people. It’s going to be fantastic for the economy. It’s going to keep companies from leaving our shores and opening up in other countries.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan will no longer require interns to commit to a lifetime of servitude at age 8&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Times, &lt;a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/goldman-jpmorgan-hit-pause-on-intern-recruiting-madness-1540819063\"&gt;they are a-changin’&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase &amp;amp; Co. won’t interview or extend summer internship offers to college sophomores this year and will go back to recruiting students in the fall of their junior year, executives said. It is a nod to a softer Wall Street, eager to cast off its sweatbox image to compete with perk-happy Silicon Valley. It is also an acknowledgment that a push in recent years to move up application deadlines isn’t bringing in the kinds of candidates banks need as they try to diversify their overwhelmingly white and male ranks.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Earlier timetables and “exploding” job offers that expire within a few days have ramped up the pressure on students to commit, said &lt;strong&gt;Amy Donegan,&lt;/strong&gt; an assistant dean at Boston College’s Carroll School of Management. “These are 19-year-old kids,” she said. “It’s really hard to tell them, ‘You can say no to that.’”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It’s unclear what impact the new policy will have on current junior employees who, at Goldman Sachs, are &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/09/populist-revolt-at-goldman-sachs-lloyd-blankfein-office\"&gt;said to be&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;this close&lt;/em&gt; to storming the C-suite and rioting over inhuman working conditions, like only getting $25 to spend on dinner each night.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elsewhere!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warren Buffett’s&lt;/strong&gt; Firm Invests Millions in Fintech (&lt;a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/warren-buffetts-firm-invests-millions-in-fintech-1540807200?mod=hp_lead_pos4\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;W.S.J.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin Could Theoretically Put Paris Climate Goals Out of Reach (&lt;a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-29/bitcoin-could-theoretically-put-paris-climate-goals-out-of-reach\"&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Sweden Is Going Cashless So Quickly That Its Central Bank Is Speeding Up Plans for a National Digital Currency (&lt;a href=\"http://fortune.com/2018/10/26/sweden-riksbank-e-krona/\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortune&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;How Blackstone Landed $20 Billion from Saudis for New Fund (&lt;a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-22/how-blackstone-landed-20-billion-from-saudis-for-infrastructure\"&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Business education: have we reached peak M.B.A. (&lt;a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d8ec7cd6-d153-11e8-a9f2-7574db66bcd5\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Authorities say they’ve captured a man suspected of dumping his grandson’s soiled diapers along several New Jersey roadways over the past year.

class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was, to be sure, a discomfiting scene: there was Secretary of State &lt;strong&gt;Mike Pompeo&lt;/strong&gt; amiably clutching the hand of Saudi Crown Prince &lt;strong&gt;Mohammed bin Salman&lt;/strong&gt; in an ornate meeting room in Riyadh a mere fortnight after &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; columnist and Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi had gone missing. The steady drumbeat of revelations had been perplexing and damning and almost inconceivable: the video evidence of Khashoggi entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul; the reports of a 15-person Saudi “kill” team landing in the city, including a so-called bone-saw expert; and &lt;strong&gt;Donald Trump’s&lt;/strong&gt; myriad equivocations. Yet as evidence increasingly suggested a connection between M.B.S. and the presumed murder, Pompeo’s visit seemed like the latest assault to diplomacy. Despite what should have been a somber, mordant affair, he looked like Ed McMahon about to present an oversize check before the camera. (On Friday night, the Saudis conceded what everyone had long known: Khashoggi was dead.)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Back in Washington, members of the diplomatic and intelligence community that I spoke with were gobsmacked. While Axios has &lt;a href=\"https://www.axios.com/saudi-arabia-mike-pompeo-meeting-jamal-khashoggi-1480d505-dcbc-46cb-97e0-34ba5a08655f.html\"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that Pompeo uttered harsh words beneath his avuncular civility, many found the optics insurmountable. “The grip and grin sort of stunned people who saw it,” a congressional aide told me. “There is a lack of confidence that he is doing everything in his power to actually get the truth in this case.” Among diplomatic veterans, Pompeo’s affable demeanor was a real misstep. “Pompeo did not handle this well,” a former high-ranking State Department official sighed. “I don’t think it would have been difficult to be more somber in meetings and more nuanced in comments afterward.” As one State department official lamented to me, “Certainly from where I sit, it is discouraging to see the administration seemingly subordinate our values to other interests in such an egregious case.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Since reports of Khashoggi’s disappearance first began to circulate, Trump has signaled that the death of one journalist&amp;#8212;a citizen of Saudi Arabia, not the United States&amp;#8212;was not worth rupturing the U.S.-Saudi relationship. Last week, the president said it would be a “very tough pill to swallow for our country” if the kingdom was found to be responsible for the assumed killing of Khashoggi, and a $110 billion U.S. arms sales deal with Saudi Arabia was correspondingly imperiled. And despite mounting evidence that M.B.S. was involved, Trump suggested as recently as Monday that “rogue killers” could have been behind the hit. “I have never seen anything quite like that, with the president playing the role of defense lawyer to someone who appears to have murdered a U.S. resident overseas in flagrant violation of every diplomatic norm,” &lt;strong&gt;Daniel Benaim,&lt;/strong&gt; who served as a Middle East adviser to Vice President &lt;strong&gt;Joe Biden,&lt;/strong&gt; told me. “Not to even pretend to have an interest in the rule of law, and to jump straight to the part where you whitewash others’ crimes, is a gross abdication of American values.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;“The president was making excuses for the Saudis. The president, normally, would never do that,” said another former high-ranking State Department official who served in the Middle East. Instead, this source explained, a typical president would stress the seriousness of the situation, praise Khashoggi and the free press, call for an investigation&amp;#8212;possibly by the United Nations&amp;#8212;and rally U.S. allies to consolidate intelligence. By no means would he or she have expressed concerns that the arms agreement could become collateral. “There would be no indication one way or the other of what we were going to be doing,” they said.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not hyperbole to suggest that the Trump administration’s handling of the M.B.S. matter could well define the second half of the president’s term. The U.S.-Saudi relationship impacts everything, on a meta level, from oil prices to the Middle East peace puzzle. More specifically, Saudi Arabia has used its vast sovereign wealth fund, the Public Investment Fund, to intertwine itself with the American financial community&amp;#8212;Saudi money flows through Uber, JPMorgan Chase, Blackstone, Snap, and, &lt;a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2018/10/16/shiny-hollywood-partnership-with-saudi-arabia-suddenly-thrown-its-head/?utm_term=.92779c3aadda\"&gt;until recently&lt;/a&gt;, William Morris Endeavor. It’s also a bulwark against a nuclear Iran, a sort of inelegant centerpiece of Israel’s defense.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;More so than during the early crises of his presidency, Trump appears to comprehend the complexity of it all, which may be what has rendered his administration’s response so limp. Earlier this month, Trump harangued on Twitter that M.B.S. was innocent until proven guilty, a similar refrain he had used to protect &lt;strong&gt;Brett Kavanaugh’s&lt;/strong&gt; nomination. In the end, he seems to be hoping that the whole thing will blow over.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This defensiveness largely falls flat among his fellow lawmakers. “Across the Hill, there is just absolute disgust at what seems to have taken place, and bewilderment over the way the administration has reacted. And I think that runs the gamut from people whose baseline position would be deeply skeptical of the U.S.-Saudi relationship to people who have been traditionally strong supporters of the U.S.-Saudi relationship,” the congressional staffer told me. “By and large, the reaction on the Hill is outrage, and an insistence that we get ourselves a full, clear accounting and a deep skepticism that the Saudis are investigating this on their own&amp;#8212;despite Secretary Pompeo’s assurances&amp;#8212;are really going to provide clarity.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Benaim distilled the dissonance. “Other administrations would certainly have struggled with how to balance America’s values and interests, given the way a case like this impacts both,” he told me. “But Donald Trump doesn’t seem to have that struggle.” Instead, Trump says the quiet part out loud. “In a funny way, what you see is Donald Trump basically adopting the left-wing critique of the U.S.-Saudi relationship&amp;#8212;which reduces a very complex situation with a lot of different variables&amp;#8212;to basically, ‘They can get away with murder, because they are going to buy our weapons.’ He is actually taking the leftist critique of the relationship&amp;#8212;and embracing it.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the Khashoggi drama has unfolded, the close relationship between M.B.S. and &lt;strong&gt;Jared Kushner,&lt;/strong&gt; Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, has come under renewed scrutiny. (&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/18/world/middleeast/jamal-khashoggi-killing-saudi-arabia.html\"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; this week that Kushner was advocating on M.B.S.’s behalf within the White House.) Their relationship dates back to the early days of Trump’s presidency, when &lt;strong&gt;Rex Tillerson&lt;/strong&gt; was still running the State Department. As &lt;strong&gt;Dexter Filkins&lt;/strong&gt; has &lt;a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/in-the-wake-of-khashoggis-disappearance-saudi-arabias-crown-prince-is-pushed-to-the-brink\"&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker,&lt;/em&gt; Kushner identified M.B.S. as a “change agent” in the region, and developed a relationship that effectively sidelined Tillerson. According to one former administration official, Kushner’s communications with M.B.S. over the encrypted messaging service WhatsApp were a point of contention within the administration, one that was partly assuaged when Kushner began providing screenshots of his conversations with the National Security Council. But, this person added, “It was still an after-the-fact thing.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In recent days, a number of sources I have spoken with have raised the possibility that M.B.S.’s ties to Kushner may have instilled in the crown prince a belief that America would, indeed, turn a blind eye to the murder of Khashoggi. “I think there is a lot to be said [about how] M.B.S. thought he could get away with it because Jared Kushner was in his pocket, and so was the president for that matter,” the former State Department official who worked in the Middle East said. And after all, the Trump administration has largely ignored the war in Yemen; the strange sojourn of Lebanese Prime Minister &lt;strong&gt;Saad Hariri&lt;/strong&gt; to Saudi Arabia; the ill-fated boycott of Qatar; and M.B.S.’s spats with Canada and Germany. “The Trump administration made it clear that he had a blank check, and so what do you do when you have a blank check? You write in the craziest sum imaginable and take it to the bank, and that is what he did,” Benaim told me. “Only it seems that the blank check has bounced&amp;#8212;at least with Congress, if not with the president.” (The White House did not respond to a request from comment.)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Whether Trump will yield to the pressure from Capitol Hill and the international community, or side with his son-in-law and his buddy, remains an open question. But if evidence indeed shows that M.B.S. was behind the death of Khashoggi, the crown prince will join the ranks of Syrian President &lt;strong&gt;Bashar al-Assad,&lt;/strong&gt; Russian President &lt;strong&gt;Vladimir Putin,&lt;/strong&gt; and North Korean dictator &lt;strong&gt;Kim Jong Un,&lt;/strong&gt; all of whom have engaged in extraterritorial murders to send a clear message to dissidents. Meanwhile, any remaining hope that M.B.S. is the idealist he’s claimed to be has rapidly dissipated. “I think there was legitimate hope when M.B.S. came on the scene that he was going to be a reformer, and he was going to change course,” the congressional aide told me. “And despite initial appearances and words to that effect, it is pretty clear that is not the case.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;","rubric":"Foreign Policy","socialTitle":"“Absolute Disgust”: Diplomats Fume Over Pompeo’s Saudi “Grip and Grin”","socialDescription":"Throughout Washington, people

be the great dealmaker’s greatest scam yet.","body":"&lt;p&gt;Last month, at a rally in Mosinee, Wisconsin, &lt;strong&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/strong&gt; introduced Governor &lt;strong&gt;Scott Walker&lt;/strong&gt; to the stage with a &lt;a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2018/10/24/watch_live_president_trump_holds_maga_rally_in_mosinee_wisconsin.html\"&gt;boast&lt;/a&gt; regarding a dubious, shared accomplishment. “I got him set up with an incredible company called Foxconn,” Trump told the crowd, referring to the Taiwanese electronics manufacturing giant that had agreed to build its first U.S. plant in the Badger State. “[Foxconn] came to Wisconsin with the most incredible plan . . . It’s the most incredible thing I’ve ever seen. We toured it, and we had a ribbon-cutting a few months ago. And I handed it over to Scott . . . there’s no plant like it anywhere in the United States. One of the most incredible things I’ve ever seen. One of the most incredible things.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And it’s true! There &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; nothing like the literally incredible Foxconn deal in the United States, because the Foxconn deal&amp;#8212;&lt;a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/president-trump-welcomes-foxconn-white-house-major-jobs-announcement/\"&gt;brokered by First Son-in-Law &lt;strong&gt;Jared Kushner&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8212;has turned out to be less of a jobs boon than an economic nuclear bomb, and not the good kind, either. To put it more elegantly, the Foxconn deal is the ultimate example of Trump promising Americans the world and then handing them a flaming bag of s--t.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dan Kaufman,&lt;/strong&gt; writing for &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker,&lt;/em&gt; illuminates some of the &lt;a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/dispatch/did-scott-walker-and-donald-trump-deal-away-the-governors-race-to-foxconn\"&gt;many ways&lt;/a&gt; that the Foxconn deal will screw Wisconsin locals for years to come:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The deal will cost taxpayers more than $4.5 billion in subsidies, but because manufacturing companies in Wisconsin are already exempt from paying taxes, “Foxconn, which generated a hundred and fifty-eight billion dollars in revenue last year, will receive much of this subsidy in direct cash payments from taxpayers”&amp;#8212;the largest subsidy given to a foreign corporation in U.S. history&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If Wisconsinites ever see a return on their investment, it’ll be in 2042 at the earliest, according to analysis from the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Good old &lt;strong&gt;Scott Pruitt&lt;/strong&gt; did Foxconn a solid by “overrul[ing] the objections of his staff to grant most of southeastern Wisconsin an exemption from limits on smog pollution” so the plant can poison the air to its heart’s delight&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The company has been granted special court privileges by the state legislature, like the ability to make numerous appeals of unfavorable rulings in a single case&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The town’s Village Board of Trustees has been using eminent domain to expel obstinate homeowners, forcing them to “sell at a price determined by the village.” They’ve been able to do so by decreeing the 2,800-acre area around the plant “blighted,” a designation typically reserved for property that is “detrimental to the public health, safety, or welfare,” but which the board has extended to include property that “impairs or arrests the sound growth of the community”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;All this, when the U.S. economy is already minting some 200,000 jobs a month, was designed to create 13,000 new, middle-class manufacturing jobs, as Foxconn &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/07/foxconn-wisconsin-investment\"&gt;and Trump&lt;/a&gt; promised. Except, as Kaufman reports, the Foxconn deal will actually create far fewer jobs, and most of them will not be of the blue-collar variety.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;. . . the company recently changed the type of factory it plans to build, downsizing to a highly automated plant that will only require three thousand employees, ninety per cent of them “knowledge workers,” such as engineers, programmers, and designers. Almost all of the assembly work will be done by robots. &lt;strong&gt;Terry Gou,&lt;/strong&gt; Foxconn’s chairman, has said he plans to replace eighty percent of Foxconn’s global workforce with “Foxbots” in the next five to ten years. The company still says it will hire thirteen thousand employees in Wisconsin, but it has fallen short of similar promises in Brazil, India, and Pennsylvania, among other places. Foxconn has already replaced sixty thousand workers who were earning roughly $2.50 an hour in China. Even the expansion of I-94, which is being done to accommodate Foxconn (and being paid for by Wisconsin taxpayers) reflects Foxconn’s faith in automation: the company and the Wisconsin Department of Transportation have discussed dedicating lanes to self-driving cars and trucks.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The problems go on and on. Because the plant will be located 20 miles from the Illinois border, many employees will likely not actually be Wisconsin residents. There are concerns from local environmental groups regarding &lt;a href=\"https://journaltimes.com/opinion/editorial/journal-times-editorial-foxconn-and-our-water-supply/article_1da26180-0967-5e5e-937e-ae84bab5b69b.html\"&gt;what will become of the water supply&lt;/a&gt;. Billions in taxpayer money will be shifted away from places they could be used&amp;#8212;like on the state’s crumbling roads or understaffed rural schools. All this, again, to create very few jobs, in the scheme of things. According to calculations by two former University of Wisconsin business-school professors, “if Foxconn’s taxpayer subsidies were given to random entrepreneurs, the money would generate more than ninety thousand jobs.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Foxconn deal is, in other words, a lot like many of the other “incredible“ feats brought to America by the mind behind Trump University and the United States Football League and the Carrier plant &lt;a href=\"https://www.aol.com/article/finance/2017/06/07/despite-7-million-tax-break-from-trump-carrier-is-still-laying/22130732/\"&gt;that laid off more than 600 workers&lt;/a&gt; and the Ford factory that got &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/06/donald-trump-boeing\"&gt;moved to China&lt;/a&gt; and the trillion-dollar corporate tax cut that has mysteriously &lt;a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/finance/413676-survey-firms-largely-havent-boosted-hiring-or-investments-due-to-gop-tax-law\"&gt;failed to trickle down&lt;/a&gt;. Incredible, &lt;em&gt;indeed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In a statement, a company representative said, “Foxconn is fully committed to our investment of at least $10 billion in building our state-of-the-art Wisconsin Valley Science and Technology Park in Wisconsin and to meeting all contractual obligations with the relevant government agencies.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you would like to receive the Levin Report in your inbox daily, &lt;a href=\"http://tinyletter.com/besslevin\"&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt; to subscribe.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’ll never believe it but Trump has gone easy on corporate wrongdoing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We know, it’s a total shock! &lt;a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/03/us/trump-sec-doj-corporate-penalties.html\"&gt;Per *The New York Times&lt;/a&gt;:*&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In the final months of the Obama administration, Walmart was under pressure from federal officials to pay nearly $1 billion and accept a guilty plea to resolve a foreign bribery investigation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Barclays faced demands that it pay nearly $7 billion to settle civil claims that it had sold toxic mortgage investments that helped fuel the 2008 financial crisis, and the Royal Bank of Scotland was ensnared in a criminal investigation over its role in the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The three corporate giants complained that the Obama administration was being unreasonable and stood their ground, according to people briefed on the investigations. After President Trump took office, they looked to his administration for a more sympathetic ear&amp;#8212;and got one.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Federal prosecutors and the Securities and Exchange Commission have yet to charge Walmart, and the Justice Department reached a much lower settlement agreement with Barclays in March, for $2 billion. R.B.S. paid a civil penalty, but escaped criminal charges altogether.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;According to analysis by the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; comparing the last 20 months of the Obama administration with the first 20 months of the Trump administration, there has been: a 62 percent plunge in penalties imposed and ill-gotten gains ordered returned by the Securities and Exchange Commission; a 72 percent drop in corporate penalties from criminal prosecutions at the Justice Department; and just one-quarter the amount of penalties imposed on the banking industry by the S.E.C. But while &lt;strong&gt;Brandon Garrett,&lt;/strong&gt; a Duke University professor, told the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; the the sharp falloff has led to the sense among companies that “there’s no reason to fear prosecution for committing serious corporate crimes,” Trump’s S.E.C. is shocked and offended by the notion it is going easy on corporate America. “The article’s conclusion that enforcement of the federal securities laws has flagged rests on deeply flawed methodology,” &lt;strong&gt;Stephanie Avakian&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Steven Peikin,&lt;/strong&gt; the heads of enforcement, said in a statement. “As the thorough analysis in our annual report makes clear, the division of enforcement’s performance, effectiveness, and activity level during our tenure compares favorably with any period in the commission’s history.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Under Armour will no longer allow employees to use company funds at strip clubs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Meaning, yes, there was a time in which swiping corporate credit cards for lap dances and the like &lt;a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/under-armours-metoo-moment-no-more-strip-clubs-on-company-dime-1541450209\"&gt;was standard company practice&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Over the years, executives and employees of the sports-apparel company, including Chairman and Chief Executive &lt;strong&gt;Kevin Plank,&lt;/strong&gt; went with athletes or co-workers to strip clubs after some corporate and sporting events, and the company often paid for the visits of many attendees, people familiar with the matter said. . . . In a Feb. 20 e-mail to staff, Under Armour’s finance chief, &lt;strong&gt;David Bergman,&lt;/strong&gt; said the company would no longer reimburse certain expenses, including adult entertainment, limousine services and gambling, according to the e-mail, which was reviewed by the Journal.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;One venue popular with some employees was the Scores club, featuring nude dancers, near downtown Baltimore and a short drive from Under Armour headquarters. On some visits, employees charged hundreds of dollars there to the company, according to some of the people familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In a statement, Plank told &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal:&lt;/em&gt; “Our teammates deserve to work in a respectful and empowering environment. We believe that there is systemic inequality in the global workplace and we will embrace this moment to accelerate the ongoing meaningful cultural transformation that is already under way at Under Armour. We can and will do better.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Goldman Sachs will change fewer lives this year&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The firm, which is currently dealing the fallout of two former employees being &lt;a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/01/us-charges-former-goldman-bankers-for-1mdb.html\"&gt;indicted&lt;/a&gt; on criminal charges tied to the alleged theft of $4.5 billion from Malaysian sovereign wealth fund 1MDB, is inducting a historically tiny number of people into what was once essentially the Brotherhood of F--k You Money, and has now been downgraded to the &lt;a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/fewer-stars-to-rise-at-goldman-sachs-as-partnership-class-shrinks-1541343364\"&gt;Brotherhood of A Lot of Money&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Wall Street firm is set to name its smallest class of new partners in years this week, according to people familiar with the matter. It’s the first crop of promotions under Chief Executive &lt;strong&gt;David Solomon,&lt;/strong&gt; who aims to keep Goldman’s upper ranks exclusive and compensate for a recent influx of outside hires.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Fewer than 65 people are likely to get the nod, the people said. That would be the smallest class since 1998, when Goldman was still a private company, and fewer than the 84 promoted two years ago.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Being a Goldman partner once meant tying one’s personal fortunes to the firm’s. From its founding in 1869 until its 1999 initial public offering, Goldman’s partners funded its balance sheet, sharing profits and shouldering losses.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Today the title is largely symbolic&amp;#8212;partners own less than 5 percent of the firm&amp;#8212;but the every-other-year selection process remains a central part of Goldman’s identity, a way to reward and motivate employees and guard the firm’s culture.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Area man’s lips move, ergo area man tells lies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Gotta get the good ones in before voters head to the polls!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"&gt;&lt;blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/ddale8/status/1059539625344143361\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/ddale8/status/1059539625344143361\"&gt;https://twitter.com/ddale8/status/1059539625344143361&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elsewhere!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Wall Street Moguls Predict the Dems Will Take the House, the G.O.P.

The son of a factory worker, Ailes was raised in middle America, starting a career in television in the 1960s. After a spirited conversation with Richard Nixon in 1967, Ailes was called upon by the presidential candidate to help with his election campaign. Ailes helped see Nixon to victory, and helped with George H.W. Bush’s 1988 win over Michael Dukakis. Ailes’s political consulting career lasted into the 1990s, when he unsuccessfully attempted to help Richard Thornburgh get elected into the U.S. Senate. After the September 11 attacks, Ailes advised President George W. Bush on how to respond to the acts of terrorism to keep the faith of the American people.\n&lt;p&gt;Ailes’s television network has shaped the national agenda, forging a 24/7 dialogue about conservatism into the collective consciousness of mainstream United States. During his tenure he’s created the careers of conservative media figureheads like Megyn Kelly and Bill O’Reilly. Reporter Gabriel Sherman has called Ailes “the indispensable figure in conservative America and the man any Republican politician with presidential aspirations must court.” But Ailes, who is well into his 70s and suffers from ongoing health issues, also faces a challenge. His leadership has been tested as the Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump attacks Fox. There’s a contentious battle for Ailes’s successor at Fox News&amp;#8212;in 2016, Ailes left the network amid allegations of sexual harassment from female Fox News anchors including Gretchen Carlson. (Ailes has repeatedly denied the allegations.) Ailes and his wife, Elizabeth Tilson, reside upstate, away from the noise and bustle of Fox&amp;#39;s Midtown Manhattan offices.&lt;/p&gt;","socialMedia":[],"photos":{"tout":[{"aspectRatios":{"3:2":{"width":1050,"height":700,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":343,"height":700,"width":1050}}},"5:3":{"width":1165,"height":699,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":117,"width":1165,"height":699}}},"2:3":{"width":466,"height":699,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":467,"width":466,"height":699}}},"16:9":{"width":1232,"height":693,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":84,"width":1232,"height":693}}},"4:3":{"width":932,"height":699,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":234,"width":932,"height":699}}},"1:1":{"width":700,"height":700,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":350,"width":700,"height":700}}},"master":{"format":"JPEG","url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2016/05/25/5745d1238c923dbe03a2a837_hive-contributor-profile-roger-ailes.jpg","width":1400,"height":700}},"revisionCreatedAt":"May 25, 2016 12:22 pm","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","image":true},"revisionAuthor":"Jarondakie Patrick","filename":"hive-contributor-profile-roger-ailes.jpg","_embedded":{"categories-channels":[],"variantXsmall":[],"variantSmall":[],"variantMedium":[],"variantLarge":[],"variantXlarge":[],"_categories":{}},"title":"hive-contributor-profile-roger-ailes.jpg","credit":"By Wesley Mann/FOX News/Getty Images.","_links":{},"id":"5745d123b09823be03ef3d51","createdAt":"May 25, 2016 12:21 pm","revision":4,"modifiedAt":"May 25, 2016 12:22 pm","description":"Getty not 250: 502271006","contributors":{}}]},"pubDate":"May 25, 2017 11:21 am","url":"/people/roger-ailes","mainPhotoContributors":{},"_embedded":{"photosTout":[{"fields":{"aspectRatios":{"3:2":{"width":1050,"height":700,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":343,"height":700,"width":1050}}},"5:3":{"width":1165,"height":699,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":117,"width":1165,"height":699}}},"2:3":{"width":466,"height":699,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":467,"width":466,"height":699}}},"16:9":{"width":1232,"height":693,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":84,"width":1232,"height":693}}},"4:3":{"width":932,"height":699,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":234,"width":932,"height":699}}},"1:1":{"width":700,"height":700,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":350,"width":700,"height":700}}},"master":{"format":"JPEG","url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2016/05/25/5745d1238c923dbe03a2a837_hive-contributor-profile-roger-ailes.jpg","width":1400,"height":700}},"revisionCreatedAt":"May 25, 2016 12:22 pm","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","image":true},"revisionAuthor":"Jarondakie Patrick","filename":"hive-contributor-profile-roger-ailes.jpg","_embedded":{"categories-channels":[],"variantXsmall":[],"variantSmall":[],"variantMedium":[],"variantLarge":[],"variantXlarge":[],"_categories":{}},"title":"hive-contributor-profile-roger-ailes.jpg","credit":"By Wesley Mann/FOX News/Getty Images.","_links":{},"id":"5745d123b09823be03ef3d51","createdAt":"May 25, 2016 12:21 pm","revision":4,"modifiedAt":"May 25, 2016 12:22 pm","description":"Getty not 250: 502271006","contributors":{}}}],"contributorsAuthor":[],"contributorsPhotographer":[],"_categories":{},"publishHistory":{"entityId":"573605ec84cb4922586ccf4e","revision":5,"pubDate":"May 25, 2017 11:21 am","revisionAuthor":"Charles Truelson","searchable":true,"expired":false,"createdAt":"May 25, 2017 11:21 am","uri":"people/roger-ailes"},"related":[{}]},"relatedItems":{"items":[{"hed":"Roger Ailes Movie Dropped by Annapurna Weeks Before Cameras Were Set to Roll","promoHed":"Roger Ailes Movie Dropped by Annapurna Weeks Before Cameras Were Set to Roll","dek":"Is the juicy-sounding Fox News drama in trouble?","promoDek":"Is the juicy-sounding Fox News drama in trouble?","body":"&lt;p&gt;Just two weeks before production was set to start, Annapurna Pictures is letting go of &lt;strong&gt;Jay Roach’s&lt;/strong&gt; prestige-y drama about former Fox leader Roger Ailes and his damning sexual misconduct scandal. According to &lt;a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/roger-ailes-movie-dropped-by-annapurna-days-before-production-start-1150561?\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, disagreements arose about the film’s reported $35 million budget.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Roach’s film has been a much buzzed-about project for the last few weeks, assembling an all-star cast that includes &lt;strong&gt;John Lithgow&lt;/strong&gt; as Ailes, &lt;strong&gt;Nicole Kidman&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/10/naomi-watts-gretchen-carlson-nicole-kidman\"&gt;and not &lt;strong&gt;Naomi Watts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as former Fox anchor &lt;strong&gt;Gretchen Carlson,&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Charlize Theron&lt;/strong&gt; as former Fox anchor &lt;strong&gt;Megyn Kelly,&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Margot Robbie&lt;/strong&gt; as associate producer Kayla Pospisil. It was reported as recently as Monday that &lt;strong&gt;Malcolm McDowell&lt;/strong&gt; had just signed up to play &lt;strong&gt;Rupert Murdoch.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For all intents and purposes, the film seemed like a perfect project for a production company like prestige-y Annapurna&amp;#8212;rich (if utterly depressing) source material, an established director, and a cast that will carry this thing into the center of the awards-season conversation. Even its relatively modest budget is on par with the films that &lt;strong&gt;Megan Ellison’s&lt;/strong&gt; company usually green-lights. So, what went wrong? Representatives for Annapurna have not yet responded to &lt;em&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/em&gt;’s request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Per &lt;em&gt;T.H.R.,&lt;/em&gt; Canadian-based company Bron Studios&amp;#8212;which has previously fueled films like &lt;em&gt;Fences&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8212;has stepped in to co-finance Roach’s movie. In addition, plenty of outfits are now circling the free agent, including Oscar-guzzlers Focus Features, Amblin, and Participant Media.&lt;/p&gt;","rubric":"where to next?","socialTitle":"Roger Ailes

Is he betting on a presidential pardon, or simply taking a cue from Paul Manafort?","body":"&lt;p&gt;For months, &lt;strong&gt;Roger Stone&lt;/strong&gt; has been predicting his indictment by &lt;strong&gt;Robert Mueller.&lt;/strong&gt; “It is not inconceivable now that Mr. Mueller and his team may seek to conjure up some extraneous crime pertaining to my business, or maybe not even pertaining to the 2016 election,” he &lt;a href=\"https://thinkprogress.org/roger-stone-expects-may-be-indicted-extraneous-crime-8afcf4af2ebf/\"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Meet the Press&lt;/em&gt; in May. At least eight of his current or former associates had been “terrorized” by the special counsel’s office, he claimed. In an August e-mail to supporters, urging them to help fund his legal defense, he sounded resigned to his fate. “Robert Mueller is coming for me,” he &lt;a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/aug/27/roger-stone-trump-russia-investigation-mueller-indictment-latest-news\"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Stone, a longtime Republican operative who has worked with &lt;strong&gt;Paul Manafort&lt;/strong&gt; and advised &lt;strong&gt;Donald Trump,&lt;/strong&gt; remains a free man. But as the midterms approach and Mueller prepares to re-enter the spotlight, a flurry of activity inside the special counsel’s office suggests that Stone’s “time in the barrel,” as he memorably &lt;a href=\"http://theweek.com/speedreads/740483/roger-stone-suspiciously-predicted-podesta-emails-now-investigators-think-know-how\"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;strong&gt;John Podesta,&lt;/strong&gt; may finally be at hand. In recent weeks, federal prosecutors have &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/paul-manafort-has-begun-dishing-on-roger-stone-mueller\"&gt;interviewed&lt;/a&gt; nearly a dozen Stone associates, a number of whom have testified before a grand jury. They have also interviewed Manafort, who recently cut a plea deal with the special counsel, about his former colleague. According to multiple reports, investigators are interested in whether Stone’s communications with WikiLeaks and the Russian hacker known as “Guccifer 2.0,” who allegedly hacked the Clinton campaign, constitute a criminal conspiracy.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;At issue is whether Stone or other Trump associates had prior knowledge of WikiLeaks’s plans to release the thousands of e-mails obtained by the Russians, or whether they coordinated their efforts in any way. Stone, for his part, has long maintained that he knew nothing of the e-mail dumps himself, despite his August 2016 boast about communicating with WikiLeaks founder &lt;strong&gt;Julian Assange&lt;/strong&gt; and his subsequent prediction that Podesta&amp;#8212;&lt;strong&gt;Hillary Clinton’s&lt;/strong&gt; campaign manager&amp;#8212;would be their next target. When Podesta’s hacked e-mails were indeed leaked, some six weeks later, Stone immediately came under suspicion. Throughout October, the self-described “dirty trickster” continued to make predictions about future WikiLeaks e-mail dumps, hinting often at an “October surprise.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Stone has since downplayed his ties to WikiLeaks, insisting that he never actually spoke with Assange, and that his real source was radio personality &lt;strong&gt;Randy Credico.&lt;/strong&gt; The supposed prophecy regarding Podesta, Stone later claimed, was also a &lt;a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/roger-stones-claim-of-a-2016-julian-assange-meeting-draws-scrutiny-1522695471\"&gt;reference to his brother&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Tony Podesta,&lt;/strong&gt; a well-known Democratic lobbyist.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Stone’s account puts him at odds with Credico, who has denied that he acted as the intermediary between WikiLeaks and Stone. Credico allies &lt;a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/special-counsel-examines-conflicting-accounts-as-scrutiny-of-roger-stone-and-wikileaks-deepens/2018/10/21/db9ab1c2-bde5-11e8-be70-52bd11fe18af_story.html\"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; that he believes Stone has set him up as a “decoy.” Of course, both men have an incentive to blame the other. According to a person familiar with the matter, Credico has testified before a grand jury that Stone told him about his back channel to WikiLeaks. But two Stone associates, filmmaker &lt;strong&gt;David Lugo&lt;/strong&gt; and attorney &lt;strong&gt;Tyler Nixon,&lt;/strong&gt; said Credico has acknowledged that he was Stone’s source. In text messages Lugo provided to the &lt;em&gt;Post,&lt;/em&gt; Credico wrote, “I knew Rodger [sic] was going to name me sooner or later and so I told you that I’m the so-called back Channel.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The stakes are high for Stone as Mueller seeks to disentangle the conflicting claims. During his September 2017 &lt;a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/09/26/roger-stones-defiant-congressional-testimony-on-trump-and-russia-annotated/?utm_term=.3f32521c6ff2\"&gt;testimony&lt;/a&gt; before the House Intelligence Committee, Stone claimed he had “never said or written” that he had any direct communications with Assange, and that any of his communications with WikiLeaks were through Credico. Stone’s phrasing may have been deliberately unclear. But if Credico’s account is truthful, then Stone may have perjured himself.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It is a federal crime to “knowingly and willfully” provide “materially” false statements to Congress&amp;#8212;even if one is not under oath. If Stone is determined to have misled lawmakers about his contacts with WikiLeaks and Assange, he could face up to five years in prison. And notably, Stone wouldn’t be the first individual to get saddled with this charge as part of a special-counsel investigation. &lt;strong&gt;John M. Poindexter,&lt;/strong&gt; who served as the national-security adviser to President Ronald Reagan, was sentenced to prison for lying to Congress about the Iran-Contra affair, though the conviction was later overturned. More recently, Mueller has leveraged false statements by &lt;strong&gt;Mike Flynn, Rick Gates,&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;George Papadopoulos&lt;/strong&gt; to gain their cooperation. If the special counsel is still working his way up the food chain, as the White House fears, then he may be seeking to flip Stone next.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Stone, for his part, has said he will never turn on Trump. “The special counsel pokes into every aspect of my social, family, personal, business, and political life, seeking something&amp;#8212;anything&amp;#8212;he can use to pressure me, to silence me, and to try to induce me to testify against my friend Donald Trump,” he told the &lt;em&gt;Post.&lt;/em&gt; “This I will not do. When I say I won’t roll on the president, what I mean is I will not be forced to make up lies to bring him down.” The strength of that assertion may suggest Stone is holding open the door for a presidential pardon if things go south. Or perhaps Stone is simply taking his cue from Manafort when it comes to dealing with the special counsel, and waiting until the last moment to cave.&lt;/p&gt;","rubric":"Mueller Investigation","socialTitle":"Roger Stone Is Running Out of Options","socialDescription":"Stone, who is under investigation by Robert Mueller, says he’ll never “roll” on Trump.

Stone says he expects he could be indicted soon.","body":"&lt;p&gt;While the White House busies itself with next month’s midterm elections, the Justice Department investigation into the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia appears to be quietly accelerating. In the nearly five weeks since he pleaded guilty, CNN &lt;a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/17/politics/muellers-quiet-period-has-not-been-very-quiet/index.html\"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;strong&gt;Paul Manafort&lt;/strong&gt; has become a frequent guest of &lt;strong&gt;Robert Mueller,&lt;/strong&gt; visiting the special counsel’s office in downtown Washington, D.C., no less than nine times since cutting a deal last month to aid Mueller’s probe in exchange for a reduced set of charges. Each day, according to the report, Manafort has pulled up at Mueller’s nondescript headquarters in a black Ford S.U.V.; based on the time he typically leaves, each session lasts about six hours.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;While the exact nature of these conversations remains a mystery, it is believed Mueller is interested in a number of critical episodes that occurred while Manafort led Trump’s campaign through the G.O.P. nomination. Perhaps most notable is the infamous June 2016 Trump Tower meeting between Manafort, &lt;strong&gt;Donald Trump Jr.,&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Jared Kushner,&lt;/strong&gt; and a Kremlin-connected Russian lawyer. One source familiar with the matter told CNN that prosecutors have questioned Manafort&amp;#8212;who worked for many years as a consultant for a pro-Russian political party in Ukraine&amp;#8212;about his contacts with Russia. Other sources &lt;a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/special-counsel-pushing-paul-manafort-information-roger-stone/story?id=58572284\"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; ABC News that Mueller has been asking Manafort about his former business partner &lt;strong&gt;Roger Stone,&lt;/strong&gt; a longtime Trump confidant who communicated with WikiLeaks and the Russian hacker Guccifer 2.0 during the campaign regarding the release of e-mails stolen from the Clinton campaign.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Stone dismissed the notion that Manafort, whom he has known for decades, will provide any damaging information to prosecutors. “I am highly confident Mr. Manafort is aware of no wrongdoing on my part during the 2016 campaign, or at any other time, and therefore there is no wrongdoing to know about,” he told ABC. “Narratives to the contrary by some in the media are false and defamatory.” And yet, for weeks Stone has signaled that he’s resigned to the possibility that Mueller will indict him. According to ABC, nearly a dozen Stone associates have been questioned by the special counsel, and a number have also appeared before a federal grand jury. “It’s not outside the realm of possibility” that Mueller “may consider bringing some offense against me,” Stone acknowledged in an earlier interview with ABC.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Nor is Manafort the only Trump alum who is unburdening himself to the special counsel. CNN reports that both &lt;strong&gt;Rick Gates,&lt;/strong&gt; Manafort’s deputy and longtime business associate, and &lt;strong&gt;Mike Flynn,&lt;/strong&gt; Trump’s former national security adviser, have met with the special counsel since pleading guilty. As my colleague &lt;strong&gt;Emily Jane Fox&lt;/strong&gt; first &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/michael-cohen-trump-investigation\"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;, Trump’s former lawyer and fixer &lt;strong&gt;Michael Cohen&lt;/strong&gt; has also met with federal investigators, providing more than 50 hours of information relevant to the Mueller inquiry and to the Southern District of New York.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Despite the flurry of activity, the Mueller probe has been publicly muted as midterms approach, with the special counsel &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/robert-mueller-investigation-november-midterm-elections\"&gt;hewing closely&lt;/a&gt; to Justice Department guidelines that stipulate prosecutors should avoid taking any major steps close to elections. Mueller will reportedly release his findings shortly after midterms, though it remains unclear whether that will mark the end of the investigation. There are growing expectations in Washington for Mueller to drop a large-scale indictment&amp;#8212;one that could strike closer to home for Trump&amp;#8212;once ballots are cast. And notably, Mueller’s team is still locked in negotiations with Trump’s lawyers about the possibility of a presidential interview: CNN &lt;a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/11/politics/trump-lawyers-preparing-answers-mueller-questions/index.html\"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; last week that Trump’s legal team is preparing answers to written questions related to whether the Trump campaign colluded with the Russian in 2016. When asked if he would be willing to sit for an interview with Mueller, Trump told the Associated Press Tuesday, “You know that’s in process. It’s a tremendous waste of time for the president of the United States.”&lt;/p&gt;","rubric":"Russia Investigation","socialTitle":"Paul Manafort Has Begun Dishing on Roger Stone","socialDescription":"Trump’s former campaign chairman has become a frequent guest at the special counsel’s office as the Russia investigation quietly accelerates.

href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/people/roger-ailes\"&gt;Roger Ailes&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; a former Fox News staffer recalls his early days at the conservative cable channel.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;“It was imparted on me right from the beginning that it was not about journalism,” explains &lt;strong&gt;Joe Muto,&lt;/strong&gt; a former associate producer of &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/04/how-will-history-remember-bill-oreilly\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The O&amp;#39;Reilly Factor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; His commentary sounds especially eerie in the Fake News era: “It was about drawing the biggest audience possible. We used to call it ‘riling up the crazies.’ That’s what we were there to do. We were there to stir up outrage.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Divide and Conquer&lt;/em&gt;, which premiered at the Toronto Film Festival this week, is part character study of Ailes, the political consultant and media mastermind who founded &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/06/fox-news-pleading-for-mercy-in-donald-trumps-court\"&gt;Fox News&lt;/a&gt; in 1996, and part post-mortem of Trump’s election. The two went hand in hand; explains Muto, “Trump is such a Fox-y character that if he wasn’t real, Roger Ailes would have created him in a lab.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Bloom, who previously co-directed &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/01/bright-lights-documentary-carrie-fisher-debbie-reynolds-emotional-moments\"&gt;Bright Lights: Starring Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds,&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; initially intended to make a documentary about &lt;strong&gt;Rupert Murdoch,&lt;/strong&gt; the News Corp media mogul who hired Ailes. But Bloom ran into issues of access. And besides, Bloom told &lt;em&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/em&gt; this week, “He’s tough to watch. Murdoch’s had such an enormous influence on our lives, on our media landscape. But he’s this organism that’s perfectly designed to make money. And that’s the only thing that animates him. Doesn’t make a terribly good subject for a documentary.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Ailes, who died last year, was a bit more charismatic. He spent some of his early career on-camera and, in one of his more light-hearted trivia notes, at one point tap-danced as a means to maintain a slim physique. Ailes also had a more intriguing backstory than Murdoch: born in Ohio, Ailes was diagnosed with hemophilia as a child and lived in fear of the medical condition. Though he could not cure the disorder, he found a way to inflict fear in others.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Asked how much sympathy she has for film subjects like Ailes&amp;#8212;a man accused of stoking outrage, serial sexual harassment, and extinguishing the careers of women who resisted him&amp;#8212;Bloom was careful not to cast men like him as black-and-white villains. “It’s too convenient to make them a monster, or sort of shovel them into a paradigm,” said Bloom. “We’re all in this together. We’re all human. I grew up in apartheid South Africa where there was sort of extraordinary evil in very ordinary guises. People who enforced apartheid on a daily level, from not letting black Africans into the tennis club or onto the beach&amp;#8212;not all of those people were evil, although their acts were certainly despicable. I fundamentally connect with all people as human. And if you’re going to do a film like one about Roger, you have to know that he’s ordinary and human in some way.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"embed cneembed\"&gt;&lt;div class=\"embed block cneembed\" data-url=\"//player.cnevids.com/script/video/591dcd1bb57ac34325000011.js?muted=1\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ailes certainly had his hangups: he spun lies and created a false mythology for himself. (He incorrectly claimed, for example, that he invented the split-screen effect). His relationship with his mother had not been very physical&amp;#8212;in an interview, Ailes confessed this could have been because his mother felt responsible for his hemophilia. Ailes was also wildly paranoid, so much so that he carried a gun at all times, installed a steel door to guard his office, and outfitted his personal and professional lairs with cameras.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Ailes began his career working up the production ladder on &lt;em&gt;The Mike Douglas Show&lt;/em&gt; before pivoting to politics. As a consultant to Nixon during the 1968 presidential campaign, Ailes helped repair Nixon’s image after his disastrous first debate with John F. Kennedy. Years later, he would exercise his eye for optics in less savory ways&amp;#8212;at &lt;em&gt;America’s Talking&lt;/em&gt;, the channel he ran before Fox News, Ailes encouraged the female anchors to wear short skirts and sit at translucent desks where their legs were backlit. Explains one staffer in the film, “Roger always knew the lowest common denominator in people&amp;#8212;he knew how to strike at that.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Bloom had to carefully navigate her interviews with women who say they were sexually harassed by Ailes. Some accusers did not feel comfortable sharing their stories. Others had accepted settlements, preventing them from speaking to the filmmaker. Bloom ended up interviewing former Republican National Committee field adviser &lt;strong&gt;Kellie Boyle&lt;/strong&gt;, former WNYW correspondent &lt;strong&gt;Lidia Curanaj&lt;/strong&gt;, and former model &lt;strong&gt;Marsha Callahan,&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#8212;all three of whom say they were punished, in one way or another, for resisting advances from Ailes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It was not until 2016, two decades after founding Fox News, that his behavior caught up to him. Former &lt;em&gt;Fox and Friends&lt;/em&gt; co-host &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/08/nicole-kidman-gretchen-carlson-roger-ailes-movie-margot-robbie\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gretchen Carlson&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; filed a sexual-harassment lawsuit against Ailes that inspired dozens more accusers to come forward. (&lt;em&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/em&gt; contributor &lt;strong&gt;Sarah Ellison&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/09/roger-ailes-fox-news-final-days\"&gt;reminds us in the film&lt;/a&gt; that it was Donald Trump who helped Ailes find a crisis-management team.) His hand forced by the Murdochs, Ailes resigned from Fox News with a letter that did not &lt;a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-twenty-first-fox-ailes/fox-news-chief-ailes-resigns-after-sexual-harassment-claims-idUSKCN1012SU\"&gt;indicate he had done anything wrong&lt;/a&gt;. The following year, before taking responsibility for his alleged actions, Ailes &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/05/roger-ailes-death-fox-news\"&gt;died&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Asked what she wants audiences to take from the film, Bloom said, “I just hope the film gives a deeper understanding of the current moment in America. The monetization of fear, and the weaponization of fear, and how a channel like Fox News is really making money off stoking people’s fears.” Ailes may be dead, but his legacy&amp;#8212;Fox News&amp;#8212;remains. And his impact on politics, Bloom pointed out, “continues post-Roger.”&lt;/p&gt;","rubric":"TORONTO FILM FESTIVAL","socialTitle":"Deconstructing Roger Ailes, the Man Who Built Fox News From Fear and

Or will Watts and Kidman emerge closer than ever before?","body":"&lt;p&gt;There are few things we know to be true in this world. Among them: The earth is round; water is wet; and &lt;strong&gt;Nicole Kidman&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Naomi Watts&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://www.vulture.com/2017/08/nicole-kidman-and-naomi-wattss-best-friendship-a-history.html\"&gt;are best friends&lt;/a&gt;. They’re so close that they’re leading members of the &lt;strong&gt;Oprah Winfrey&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Gayle King&lt;/strong&gt; Institute of Celebrity Besties, nestled between duos like &lt;strong&gt;Salma Hayek&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Penelope Cruz&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Brad Pitt&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;George Clooney.&lt;/strong&gt; For this particular reason, it’s either really funny or deeply concerning that the actresses are &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; set to play &lt;strong&gt;Gretchen Carlson&lt;/strong&gt; in dueling TV and film projects. Will this bring them closer than ever? Or will a former Fox News anchor destroy one of Australia’s greatest exports?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;On Friday, Showtime announced that Watts is set to play Carlson in the eight-episode limited series &lt;em&gt;The Loudest Voice in the Room,&lt;/em&gt; based on the book of the same name by &lt;strong&gt;Gabriel Sherman&lt;/strong&gt; (who is a &lt;em&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/em&gt; special correspondent). The announcement comes just a few months after it was revealed that Kidman would &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; be playing Carlson in &lt;strong&gt;Jay Roach’s&lt;/strong&gt; upcoming feature about Fox News’s great sexual misconduct scandal, which kicked off in 2016 after Carlson filed a lawsuit against network head Roger Ailes. Several other women then came forward with accusations against Ailes, who eventually stepped down. Carlson’s lawsuit was finally &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/09/fox-news-settles-with-gretchen-carlson-for-20-million\"&gt;settled for $20 million&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It was only a matter of time, then, before Hollywood raced after the story, quickly putting together adaptations that could attract top-tier talent. But really, what are the odds that Kidman and Watts would both play Carlson? Who got the role first? And who had to subsequently text the other “lol you’ll never believe the script I just got . . .”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, the projects are in different mediums, so Kidman and Watts won’t have to face off against each other in awards races down the line. Perhaps, then, this is actually a dream for the duo? We can just see it now: the pair poring over each other’s scripts, sussing out who got the better scene-chewing moments while sitting cozily by the fire at Kidman’s farm, or Watts’s New York City abode. They’ll e-mail each other YouTube clips of Carlson interviews, with subject lines like, “this really cinched the accent work for me.” They’ll send each other selfies from their makeup chairs! And just think of the press cycles down the line, an excuse for the two to just gush about their friendship on late night couches galore! “Honestly, I was just so happy to have a partner in crime through all of this,” Kidman will breezily rehearse in the mirror, Watts standing behind her and nodding firmly. Perhaps this is all good. Perhaps this is a strange gift, a distracting backstory that will guide us through the bummer flood of Carlson-Ailes projects.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Per Showtime, &lt;em&gt;The Loudest Voice in the Room&lt;/em&gt; will also star &lt;strong&gt;Russell Crowe&lt;/strong&gt; as Ailes (while Kidman’s project will star &lt;strong&gt;John Lithgow&lt;/strong&gt; in the same part). That raises another question for us, though: On a scale of one to &lt;em&gt;Boy Erased,&lt;/em&gt; how secretly Australian are these respective projects? The Showtime series has Watts (who, yes, is actually English, but grew up partly in Australia and began her career there) and Crowe, while Kidman’s project is also circling &lt;strong&gt;Margot Robbie&lt;/strong&gt; in a lead role. Which project will tip the scale and hire the tie-breaking third Australian? There are just So! Many! Questions!&lt;/p&gt;","rubric":"best friends forever","socialTitle":"Besties Naomi Watts and Nicole Kidman Are Playing Gretchen Carlson in Dueling Projects","socialDescription":"Will this drive a wedge between Australia’s strongest friendship?

Roger Ailes was fired, in July 2016, after dozens of women accused him of sexual harassment, he delivered a warning to his boss, Rupert Murdoch. “Trump gets great ratings, but if you’re not careful, he is going to end up totally controlling Fox News,” Ailes said, a source briefed on the conversation recently recalled. “Roger was highly annoyed with Trump. He couldn’t contain him at all,” a high-level Fox staffer remembered.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But now there’s a new boss in charge&amp;#8212;sort of. His name is Lachlan Murdoch. In May, Rupert named Lachlan, his elder son, chairman and C.E.O. of “New Fox,” the slimmed-down parent company that will emerge out of the Murdochs’ $71 billion deal to sell most of their entertainment assets to Disney. Lachlan, 47, is the heir that Rupert most wanted to succeed him even though, of the candidates in the family, Lachlan seemed to want the job least. He’s never been a political junkie like his father, an overt careerist like younger brother James, or a rebellious entrepreneur like older sister Liz. In 2005, Lachlan famously walked away from the company after clashing with Ailes and former C.O.O. Peter Chernin and moved back to the family’s native Australia.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Having returned to the fold, Lachlan has so far been content to be a caretaker rather than an empire builder. Although his nameplate was installed on an office at Fox News several months ago, Lachlan, who ran the &lt;em&gt;New York Post&lt;/em&gt; in the 1990s, mostly is an absentee manager, choosing instead to work from the company’s Los Angeles office. When he occasionally drops in on Fox’s morning editorial meeting, he doesn’t cut a big presence. “He’s polite and asks questions about the news. He’s respectful and comes off as someone trying to learn,” one attendee said. In fact, Lachlan’s highest-profile decision was to hire Donald Trump’s former communications director, Hope Hicks, to be New Fox’s spokesperson. He didn’t know Hicks well&amp;#8212;they had met only a handful of times&amp;#8212;but he was encouraged by Trump and Jared Kushner to hire her. “It seems like he was doing Trump a favor,” one Fox journalist said.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;With Lachlan content to let the Fox News machine run, the hand on the wheel belongs to Fox News C.E.O. Suzanne Scott. Scott’s management style is to effectively let the network’s producers run their shows independently. “No one is in charge,” a former executive told me. Without clear direction from the top, it’s every man for himself.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Fox’s hugely successful alliance with Trump has amplified divisions and rivalries among Fox’s on-air talent. Shepard Smith has emerged as the network’s most visible capital-&lt;em&gt;J&lt;/em&gt;  journalist and quasi-ombudsman. He’s used his three P.M. newscast to debunk Trump conspiracies, like the Uranium One obsession, and give airtime to investigative stories such as &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;’s 14,000-word exposé on Trump’s alleged tax dodging. Sean Hannity has called Smith “clueless” and “so anti-Trump.” At Mar-a-Lago in April, Hannity was overheard trashing Smith to Trump, according to one person familiar with the conversation. “Hannity was denouncing Shep, and Trump was eating it up.” (Hannity denied making the remarks.) Behind the scenes, Smith has taken on a bigger role in shaping Fox’s news coverage and critiques stories he doesn’t like, something that’s rankled some executives. “He’s the one who’s power hungry. He’s trying to pull the place left,” one former executive said. (A Fox News spokesperson disputes this.) Access to Trump also stokes jealousies among hosts. Sources say business anchor Neil Cavuto has complained to colleagues about Lou Dobbs’s closeness with the president. (A Fox News spokesperson says this is “not true.”)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"callout small\" data-type=\"callout\"&gt;&lt;div class=\"embed image row\"&gt;&lt;figure class=\"embedded-image\" data-type=\"image\"&gt;&lt;div class=\"pinterest-link-container\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5bd2305d005a606878515eec/master/h_450,c_limit/cable-news-sherman-dec-2018-embed01.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-pin-desc=\"\" data-pin-credits=\"\"/&gt;&lt;a class=\"pinterest-link\" href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vanityfair.com%2Fnews%2F2018%2F10%2Finside-trumps-new-fox-takeover&amp;amp;media=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.vanityfair.com%2Fphotos%2F5bd2305d005a606878515eec%2Fmaster%2Fh_450%2Cc_limit%2Fcable-news-sherman-dec-2018-embed01.png&amp;amp;description=\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump’s dominance of Fox is partly an accident, as a result of the lack of strong internal leadership. And, of course, in ratings terms, it’s been a happy accident. But the outcome is precisely the one Ailes had warned against: the network’s identity is now inseparable from that of the president, a development that would have surely horrified Ailes. Ailes may have been a right-winger, but he was sophisticated enough to know that Fox needed enough plausible distance from the subjects it covers to maintain the fiction of being “Fair &amp;amp; Balanced.” Now Fox is effectively an arm of the White House. Trump derives “policy” ideas from segments he likes and counts Sean Hannity as one of his closest advisers. The administration can feel like a Fox greenroom on a heavy news day. John Bolton serves as Trump’s national-security adviser; former Fox contributor Ben Carson runs HUD; former &lt;em&gt;Fox &amp;amp; Friends&lt;/em&gt; newsreader Heather Nauert serves as State Department spokesperson; and former Fox president Bill Shine is deputy chief of staff for communications. (Hannity lobbied for him to get the job.) Fox military analyst General Jack Keane has been discussed inside the West Wing as a successor to Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, a former White House official said. One Fox personality literally got into bed with the Trumps: former &lt;em&gt;The Five&lt;/em&gt; co-host Kimberly Guilfoyle is dating Don junior.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For hosts and producers, it’s a strange, though not entirely unfamiliar, environment. Fox hosts regularly get calls from Trump about segments he likes&amp;#8212;or doesn’t. “When you worked at Fox, you knew that at any moment Roger Ailes was watching. Every day was like a job interview with Ailes. Now it’s the same way for Trump,” says a veteran Fox News contributor. According to sources, Trump doesn’t explicitly dictate talking points the way Ailes did, but over time the effect can be similar. “What he usually does is he’ll call after a show and say, ‘I really enjoyed that,’” a former Fox anchor told me. “The highest compliment is ‘I really learned something.’ Then you know he got a new policy idea.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The fact that the news staff knows Trump always could be tuning in means the network is being programmed for an audience of one. “He has the same embattled view as a typical Fox viewer&amp;#8212;that ‘the liberal elites hate me; they’re trying to bring me down,’ ” the former executive said. At times, anchors will use Fox segments to send messages directly to Trump. The day &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reported Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein discussed tape-recording Trump to rally support amongst the Cabinet to invoke the 25th Amendment, Hannity told Trump the article was a trap to bait him into firing Rosenstein.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"callout small\" data-type=\"callout\"&gt;&lt;div class=\"embed image row\"&gt;&lt;figure class=\"embedded-image\" data-type=\"image\"&gt;&lt;div class=\"pinterest-link-container\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5bd2305a7473bd560f08b0ca/master/h_450,c_limit/cable-news-sherman-dec-2018-embed02.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-pin-desc=\"\" data-pin-credits=\"\"/&gt;&lt;a class=\"pinterest-link\" href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vanityfair.com%2Fnews%2F2018%2F10%2Finside-trumps-new-fox-takeover&amp;amp;media=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.vanityfair.com%2Fphotos%2F5bd2305a7473bd560f08b0ca%2Fmaster%2Fh_450%2Cc_limit%2Fcable-news-sherman-dec-2018-embed02.jpg&amp;amp;description=\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"caption callout-image-caption\"&gt;&lt;div class=\"wrapper\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"credits\"&gt;Photo by Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty Images.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rupert Murdoch’s relationship with Trump, and his network’s importance in maintaining the protective bubble of propaganda around the president, is one of some irony. Murdoch has wanted a personal relationship with an American president ever since he decamped from London to New York, in the 1970s (he was not particularly close with George W. Bush, the last Republican to hold the office). With Trump, he’s achieved that goal&amp;#8212;though he has told friends he thinks Trump is a “buffoon” and his strongest personal allegiances (much like Trump’s, actually) are to the elites that Trump uses as his whipping boys. But Murdoch prizes profits above ideology, so he accommodated Trump in order to preserve access. Before the inauguration, I reported that Trump asked Murdoch to submit names for the position of F.C.C. commissioner. (Murdoch denied it at the time.)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The question for Lachlan going forward is the same one that has vexed the Republican Party in the age of Trump: when to break from Trump, if a divorce is even possible. At moments there have been frays in the bond, as when Trump doted on Vladimir Putin in Helsinki (Neil Cavuto called it “disgusting”) or attacked Brett Kavanaugh’s accuser Dr. Christine Blasey Ford (a &lt;em&gt;Fox &amp;amp; Friends&lt;/em&gt; host said Trump “chose to blow it”). This fall, panic swept through Fox’s executive ranks as it looked like Democrats had a chance to retake both the House and the Senate. “They are deathly afraid of the Dems taking the House,” one high-level staffer said. The fear, according to the staffer, is that congressional committees investigating the Trump White House could draw in Fox. “Fox is hiring lobbyists to prepare,” the staffer said. Ominously for both Fox and the president, Trump’s rallies are not drawing the numbers they once did. As Politico reported, a Trump rally on August 30, carried live in Tucker Carlson’s regular prime-time slot, drew only 2.5 million viewers, whereas Carlson had been averaging more than 2.8 million. More recently, as Trump has been barnstorming ahead of the midterms, Fox has only been dipping into his rallies.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But mostly, Fox doesn’t have much of a choice when it comes to Trump. And why not? On the day Kavanaugh shouted his way through his Senate Judiciary Committee testimony, Fox attracted a near-record 5.7 million viewers&amp;#8212;more than MSNBC and CNN combined.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;More from our Special Report on the State of Cable News:&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212; How MSNBC gamified &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/11/how-msnbc-created-a-cable-news-addiction-epidemic\"&gt;cable news into addiction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212; Inside CNN’s massive &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/11/inside-the-trump-gold-rush-at-cnn\"&gt;Trump gold rush&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"embed cneembed\"&gt;&lt;div class=\"embed block cneembed\" data-url=\"//player.cnevids.com/script/video/5bbe9f3a625710412d00003b.js?muted=1\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;","rubric":"From the Magazine","socialTitle":"“No One Is in Charge”: Inside Trump’s New Fox Takeover","socialDescription":"Lachlan Murdoch, now installed at Fox News, is a caretaker rather than an empire builder.

Her relationship with the peacock network had badly soured&amp;#8212;in truth, it had never been good&amp;#8212;and Kelly told friends she wanted to return to Fox News, according to two Fox News sources familiar with her thinking. “She wants to come back,” a person close to Kelly told me. Over the past month, according to two sources with knowledge of Kelly’s programming decisions, she made comments on air that would burnish her right-wing credentials for a prospective Fox homecoming. For instance, she vigorously defended &lt;strong&gt;Brett Kavanaugh&lt;/strong&gt; on multiple occasions, calling &lt;strong&gt;Dr. Christine Blasey Ford&lt;/strong&gt; a “Democrat donor” who was represented by a “well-known Democratic activist.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Would Fox take her? The answer right now appears to be no. A source close to &lt;strong&gt;Lachlan Murdoch,&lt;/strong&gt; C.E.O. of Fox News’s parent company “New Fox,” said he is “extremely pleased with the current lineup.” Two high-level Fox staffers said any final decision about Kelly would be made by Lachlan and his father, &lt;strong&gt;Rupert Murdoch&lt;/strong&gt; the company chairman.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Many factors are at play. Fox sources say the Murdochs, and Lachlan in particular, are still angry that Kelly rejected a $25 million a year offer before decamping to NBC. Among Fox anchors and producers, Kelly also remains a polarizing figure. Fox staffers resented how she leveraged her feud with &lt;strong&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/strong&gt; during the 2016 election for mainstream-media celebrity. Fox staffers also complain that she capitalized on &lt;strong&gt;Gretchen Carlson’s&lt;/strong&gt; lawsuit to position herself as a #MeToo crusader only after it was clear that Roger Ailes was going down. “There’s a lot of Schadenfreude,” one anchor said.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Another giant question is whether the Fox audience would welcome Kelly back. It’s hard to see the Murdochs making a spot for her in their pro-Trump primetime lineup, given her tangled history with the president. She could join the ranks of Fox journalists like &lt;strong&gt;Shepard Smith, Bret Baier,&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Chris Wallace,&lt;/strong&gt; but her interviews at NBC with &lt;strong&gt;Vladimir Putin&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Alex Jones&lt;/strong&gt; were widely panned. In a world where cable-news stars have defined themselves by their affinity to the president, or rejection of him, she occupies an uncomfortable role.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bryan Freedman,&lt;/strong&gt; a lawyer for Kelly, did not respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;More Great Stories from &lt;em&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212; Uber wants to be the next Amazon, but it &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/uber-the-next-amazon-but-others-see-the-next-yahoo?inline\"&gt;could end up the next Yahoo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212; Meet the fake Saudi prince with a &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2018/10/he-actually-believes-he-is-khalid-the-odyssey-of-a-counterfeit-saudi-prince?inline\"&gt;30-year plan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212; We talked to the most &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/inside-yamam-top-secret-israeli-anti-terrorism-operation?inline\"&gt;elite counterterrorism unit in the world&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212; Why Michael Bloomberg’s massive donations might &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/michael-bloomberg-funds-democrats-in-2018?inline\"&gt;not actually help him be president&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212; &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/where-is-barack-obama-2018-midterms?inline\"&gt;Where is Obama?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Looking for more? &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/newsletters\"&gt;Sign up&lt;/a&gt; for our daily Hive newsletter and never miss a story.&lt;/p&gt;","rubric":"Megyn Kelly","socialTitle":"“She Wants to Come Back”: Megyn Kelly Eyes Returning to Fox","socialDescription":"But, still burned by their breakup, Fox doesn’t appear to want to take her back.","seoTitle":"“She Wants to Come Back”: Megyn Kelly Eyes Returning to Fox","seoDescription":"But, still burned by their breakup, Fox doesn’t appear to want to take her back.","channel":"News","subChannel":"Politics","issueDate":"","ledeCaption":"Megyn Kelly, former Fox News anchor, prepares for an interview in New York, May 12, 2016.","contentSource":"web","canonicalUrl":"","contentType":"","textMimeType":"","tags":["megyn kelly"],"revisionAuthor":"Brad Beatson","meta":{"collectionName":"articles","modelName":"article","publishable":true,"identifiable":true,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":true,"hierarchical":false},"interactiveOverride":"","id":"5bd22ab1f912db43c4548cbd","revision":14,"createdAt":"October 25, 2018 4:42 pm","modifiedAt":"October 25, 2018 7:09 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"October 25, 2018 7:09 pm","_embedded":{"categories-channels":[{"fields":{"name":"News","slug":"news","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5ae9f11fc994fd6b2518e1a7","revision":0,"createdAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modifiedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}},{"fields":{"name":"Politics","slug":"politics","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5ae9f120dc5a49785309c3b5","revision":0,"createdAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modifiedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}}],"categories-tags":[{"fields":{"name":"megyn kelly","slug":"megyn-kelly","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5b4cb84e4f46c70bca18e36b","revision":0,"createdAt":"July 16, 2018 11:22 am","modifiedAt":"July 16, 2018 11:22 am","revisionCreatedAt":"July 16, 2018 11:22 am","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}}],"contributorsAuthor":[{"fields":{"revisionAuthor":"Jarondakie Patrick","name":"Gabriel Sherman","bio":"Gabriel Sherman is a special correspondent for &lt;em&gt;Vanity Fair.&lt;/em&gt; Most recently, Sherman served as national-affairs editor at &lt;em&gt;New York&lt;/em&gt; magazine, and he is a regular contributor to NBC News and MSNBC.

At the beginning of their relationship, Cruise was already a highly bankable star, while Kidman was a young rising actress still carving out her path in Hollywood; &lt;em&gt;Days of Thunder&lt;/em&gt; was her first American film. But in a new piece for &lt;a href=\"https://www.thecut.com/2018/10/women-and-power-nicole-kidman.html\"&gt;The Cut&lt;/a&gt;, the actress sheds a little bit of light on that time in her life, revealing that her relationship with a powerful movie star had an unexpected side effect: his status in the industry apparently offered her protection from being sexually harassed.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;“I married for love, but being married to an extremely powerful man kept me from being sexually harassed,” she says. “I would work, but I was still very much cocooned. So when I came out of it at 32, 33, it’s almost like I had to grow up.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In the piece, Kidman says it has been difficult to open up about their past relationship. “Being married to Tom Cruise at 22 is something I’m always reluctant to talk about, because I’m married now to the man who is my great love [&lt;strong&gt;Keith Urban&lt;/strong&gt;], and it almost feels disrespectful,” she writes. But now is a vital and timely moment for this discussion, as the industry is still in the midst of a massive sexual misconduct reckoning. Kidman, like so many women, also notes in the piece that she’s had “#MeToo moments” throughout her life, marriage to Cruise notwithstanding&amp;#8212;but she prefers to work through those moments in her art.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;“Of course I’ve had #MeToo moments&amp;#8212;since I was little!” she writes. “But do I want to expose them in an article? No. Do they come out in my work? Absolutely. I’m open and raw. I want to have my well of experience and emotion tapped into, used&amp;#8212;and I’m not just talking about sexual harassment. I’m talking about loss, death, the full array of life.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It’s a topical revelation from Kidman, as one of her next films will wade into the reckoning. She’s &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/10/naomi-watts-gretchen-carlson-nicole-kidman\"&gt;set to play &lt;strong&gt;Gretchen Carlson&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;strong&gt;Jay Roach’s&lt;/strong&gt; upcoming film about Fox News. The cable network was the center of a sexual harassment scandal sparked in 2016 after Carlson filed a lawsuit against network head Roger Ailes, who eventually stepped down from his place atop the company. The parties later settled for $20 million.&lt;/p&gt;","rubric":"","socialTitle":"Nicole Kidman: Being Married to Tom Cruise Protected Me from Sexual Harassment","socialDescription":"In an essay, the

company, Hollywood assesses its future.","body":"&lt;p&gt;“What will Larry do?” That was the question being asked around Hollywood on Wednesday afternoon, after news broke that billionaire Oracle founder &lt;strong&gt;Larry Ellison&lt;/strong&gt; had stepped into the fray at Annapurna Pictures, the company created by his daughter, &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2013/03/megan-ellison-27-producer-zero-dark-thirty\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Megan Ellison,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to stem the bleeding caused by her slate of high-end, auteur-driven projects.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The past 36 hours have been a whirlwind for Annapurna. First, the production company announced it was &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/10/annapurna-roger-ailes-movie\"&gt;bowing out&lt;/a&gt; of the untitled movie about former Fox News C.E.O. Roger Ailes, a mere two weeks before the start of production. Set to be directed by &lt;strong&gt;Jay Roach&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;em&gt;Trumbo&lt;/em&gt;) from a script by &lt;strong&gt;Charles Randolph&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;em&gt;The Big Short&lt;/em&gt;), and to star &lt;strong&gt;John Lithgow,&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Nicole Kidman,&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Margot Robbie,&lt;/strong&gt; the film is now being shopped to three different studios. That news coincided with a report that Annapurna’s head of production, &lt;strong&gt;Chelsea Barnard,&lt;/strong&gt; a longtime employee, had left her position, and that the company recently offloaded its high-profile, &lt;strong&gt;Jennifer Lopez&lt;/strong&gt;-starring film, &lt;em&gt;The Hustlers at Scores,&lt;/em&gt; to STX Entertainment. (One source said Annapurna abandoned the film a month ago after it couldn’t sell off the international rights.)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;These chaotic moves have caused people who are in business with 32-year-old Megan to wonder if their movies are still moving forward&amp;#8212;and left others holding their breath, hoping that one of the few remaining outfits that finances challenging films doesn’t go belly-up.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;“I don’t care how much money daddy gives you&amp;#8212;you have to make something turn a profit,” said one producer, who declined to be identified. “Yet I applaud [Megan], and desperately want her to succeed. She hasn’t made a single movie with a questionable filmmaker, and there aren’t enough people out there who are financing filmmakers. You could argue about how much she’s spent, but nevertheless I have to applaud her.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"embed cneembed\"&gt;&lt;div class=\"embed block cneembed\" data-url=\"//player.cnevids.com/script/video/5b97f00d6257106574000004.js?autoplay=0\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two sources confirmed to &lt;em&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/em&gt; that Larry is indeed stepping in with a cash infusion for Annapurna, though the extent of his involvement remains questionable&amp;#8212;as do rumors that Larry wanted the Ailes film shelved due to his close relationship with Fox mogul &lt;strong&gt;Rupert Murdoch.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://variety.com/2018/film/news/annapurna-larry-ellison-megan-ellison-vice-1202975648/\"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that the tech billionaire will be orchestrating a major reorganization of Annapurna, with layoffs expected. The company disputed these claims. “Larry has been supportive and empowering of Megan as C.E.O. of this company,” said spokesperson &lt;strong&gt;Ashley Momtaheni.&lt;/strong&gt; “His involvement has not changed since she founded Annapurna.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Megan first made a name for herself in 2012, with the $45 million financing of &lt;strong&gt;Kathryn Bigelow’s&lt;/strong&gt; Oscar-nominated &lt;em&gt;Zero Dark Thirty,&lt;/em&gt; about the killing of Osama bin Laden. Since then, she and her company have backed projects from artists as diverse as &lt;strong&gt;Spike Jonze&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;em&gt;Her&lt;/em&gt;), &lt;strong&gt;David O. Russell&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;em&gt;American Hustle,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Joy&lt;/em&gt;), &lt;strong&gt;Paul Thomas Anderson&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;em&gt;The Master,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Phantom Thread&lt;/em&gt;), and &lt;strong&gt;Richard Linklater&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;em&gt;Everybody Wants Some!!,&lt;/em&gt; the upcoming &lt;em&gt;Where’d You Go, Bernadette&lt;/em&gt;), proving to be champions of prickly auteurs.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Things started to get “wonky,” as another producer put it, when Megan decided to expand her financing/production operation into a distribution and marketing entity in January 2017&amp;#8212;a costly proposition that required her to staff up quickly and outlay big chunks of cash. The significant overhead, coupled with expensive employees, has proven challenging to the company, especially since none of the movies Annapurna has released in the past 18 months have been big moneymakers. Its one wide release, Bigelow’s &lt;em&gt;Zero Dark Thirty&lt;/em&gt; follow-up, &lt;em&gt;Detroit,&lt;/em&gt; proved to be a risk for the nascent label when it grossed only half of its $34 million budget. Yet insiders at the company insisted these are normal growing pains for a new film operation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It’s not helpful that Megan has proven to be a mercurial manager, sources said, one who is both passionate about her artists and challenging to work for. Filmmakers, though, couldn’t ask for a more engaged partner, and are effusive in their praise.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;“They all love her so much,” said &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/08/sorry-to-bother-you-nina-yang-bongiovi-forest-whitaker-boots-riley-producer\"&gt;Nina Yang Bongiovi&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; one of the producers of this summer’s Annapurna release &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/07/sorry-to-bother-you-review\"&gt;Sorry to Bother You&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; from emerging voice &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/07/sorry-to-bother-you-boots-riley-oakland\"&gt;Boots Riley&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; “If she were to go away, it would be a sad time for our business. When we were selling the film [at Sundance], she came in with a different approach. It’s very anti-corporate, anti-studio, and that’s really refreshing for artists.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It might not be best for the bottom line, though. Yang Bongiovi recognizes that the risks Ellison takes are costly. “All of [Annapurna’s] movies are hard,” she added, pointing out that &lt;em&gt;Sorry to Bother You&lt;/em&gt; was one of the bright spots in the company’s recent history (it grossed $17 million on a $3.2 million budget). “I don’t know what they do internally, but they love auteur directors. Maybe that’s not the best structure, but it’s best for the movie.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mark Boal,&lt;/strong&gt; screenwriter and producer of &lt;em&gt;Detroit,&lt;/em&gt; is also a believer in Annapurna’s viability. “The distribution [business] is really tough, and the road is littered with failed distribution companies, but Megan is here to stay,” he said. “She’s a visionary and has great taste. It would be stupid to discount that.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The company has high expectations for its upcoming slate. It’s bullish about the awards potential for Oscar winner &lt;strong&gt;Barry Jenkins’s&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Moonlight&lt;/em&gt; follow-up, &lt;em&gt;If Beale Street Could Talk,&lt;/em&gt; which will debut on Nov. 30, and &lt;strong&gt;Adam McKay’s&lt;/strong&gt; Christmas Day-opener, &lt;em&gt;Vice,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/10/christian-bale-dick-cheney-movie\"&gt;starring &lt;strong&gt;Christian Bale&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as former vice president &lt;strong&gt;Dick Cheney.&lt;/strong&gt; More commercially, Annapurna is a co-distributor of MGM’s &lt;em&gt;Creed II,&lt;/em&gt; which stars &lt;strong&gt;Michael B. Jordan&lt;/strong&gt; and opens Nov. 21, and Laika’s upcoming animated film, &lt;em&gt;Missing Link,&lt;/em&gt; opening in April. It will also co-distribute the next Bond film, Bond 25, but that won’t happen until 2020.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Until then, two sources close to Megan said she is taking a hard look at her upcoming roster and is likely to decrease spending on individual films. It’s an unwelcome proposition to filmmakers, but if it keeps the fledgling studio in business, they’ll take it. After all, Megan Ellison is one of the few Hollywood financiers willing to make tough bets.&lt;/p&gt;","rubric":"Like Father","socialTitle":"What Happens Next for Megan Ellison’s Embattled Annapurna

At the time, many wondered what had taken so long, or whether the popular Breitbart editor might see his influence in the darkest corners of the shit-stirring fringe of right-wing conservatism decline. Instead, Yiannopoulos announced a new social-media comeback. “I’m joining Gab today&amp;#8212;my username is @m. Come say hi,” &lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/myiannopoulos/photos/im-joining-gab-today-my-username-is-m-come-say-hi-theyre-giving-out-10000-new-in/755857347885496/\"&gt;he wrote on Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, adding that this new platform was giving out “10,000 new invites to celebrate my arrival.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Yiannopoulos’s embrace of Gab was a coup for the nascent platform, then barely two months old, which appeared to be a better designed, less sketchy member of the growing universe of so-called “alt-right” Web sites, including &lt;strong&gt;Steve Bannon’s&lt;/strong&gt;  Breitbart News; Daily Stormer and Vdare, with their anti-Semitic overtones; and 8chan, the anonymous image board full of Pepe the Frog memes. Gab.com’s logo was a cutesy little graphic frog face&amp;#8212;a seeming nod to Pepe, but &lt;a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/ywxb95/gab-is-the-alt-right-social-network-racists-are-moving-to\"&gt;described&lt;/a&gt; by its C.O.O. to &lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt; as “a biblical reference to the ‘plague of the frogs,’” which would rain down “revenge against those who went against mainstream conservative voices on the Internet.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Yiannopoulos’s own attempt at mainstreaming failed miserably, thanks to numerous scandals and self-inflicted wounds, but he remains one of the most popular figures on Gab, despite&amp;#8212;or, rather, due to&amp;#8212;his &lt;a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/josephbernstein/heres-how-breitbart-and-milo-smuggled-white-nationalism\"&gt;reputation&lt;/a&gt; as a white-nationalist sympathizer. Even without Yiannopoulos as a leader, Gab has become a welcome haven for his ideas, which in the following two years became a notorious redoubt for a wide spectrum of far-right pot-philosophizing, from pro-Trump nationalists to outright white supremacists and neo-Nazis. The site soon grew a small but steadfast following, increasing its membership virtually every time a popular far-right figure&amp;#8212;such as white nationalist &lt;strong&gt;Richard Spencer,&lt;/strong&gt; or MTV host-turned-Holocaust denier &lt;strong&gt;Tila Tequila&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#8212;got de-platformed elsewhere and moved their online presence to Gab.com. It became a cause célèbre for anti-social-justice-warrior media icons such as &lt;strong&gt;Ann Coulter,&lt;/strong&gt; and received increasing support from figures like &lt;strong&gt;Tucker Carlson,&lt;/strong&gt; who &lt;a href=\"https://www.dailydot.com/layer8/tucker-carlson-gab-hate-speech/\"&gt;drew criticism&lt;/a&gt; after interviewing &lt;strong&gt;Andrew Torba,&lt;/strong&gt; the Silicon Valley programmer who founded Gab.com, on his show. (Naturally, the backlash to Carlson’s interview prompted Breitbart to &lt;a href=\"https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2017/09/06/media-matters-attacks-tucker-carlson-for-discussing-online-free-speech-with-gab-ceo/\"&gt;accuse his critics&lt;/a&gt; of being anti-free speech.) But in the past week, Gab has become known as the social media base for a man who committed what is believed to be the deadliest act of anti-Semitism in American history.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Before he opened fire inside the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, killing at least 11 people who had gathered for Shabbat services, &lt;strong&gt;Robert Bowers,&lt;/strong&gt; the alleged shooter, found a safe space to express the anti-Semitic hatred that was consuming him. “There is no #MAGA as long as there is a k*** infestation,” Bowers &lt;a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/27/us/synagogue-attack-suspect-robert-bowers-profile/index.html\"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; on Gab.com. On Twitter or Facebook, Bowers’s views would have gotten him banned; on Gab, he fit right in. “Jews are the children of Satan,” read his profile. And toward the end of his post history&amp;#8212;filled with even more violent, anti-Semitic and anti-minority content&amp;#8212;he increasingly indicated that he would start acting soon. “I can’t sit by and watch my people get slaughtered,” Bowers wrote on Saturday. “Screw your optics, I’m going in.” Moments later, he began his shooting spree.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Law-enforcement authorities quickly zeroed in on Gab.com, and in the process, the obscure new face of right-wing extremism revealed itself. When the site launched, Torba touted his innovation as one of the last bastions of free speech: “Gab is not &lt;em&gt;FOR&lt;/em&gt; any particular group of people, political leaning, race, beliefs, or anything,” he &lt;a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/alexkantrowitz/new-social-network-gab-growing-fast-free-speech\"&gt;declared&lt;/a&gt;, around the same time Yiannopoulos was kicked off Twitter. “Anybody is welcome to express themselves on Gab.” In practice, however, the site quickly became a safe space for the racist expressions that got users kicked off of Facebook and Twitter. Its blind commitment to so-called free speech permitted &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; sort of discussion to thrive, even if it was hateful, violent, or anti-Semitic in nature. In a &lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt; article from April, writer &lt;strong&gt;Tom Bennett&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/ywxb95/gab-is-the-alt-right-social-network-racists-are-moving-to\"&gt;described&lt;/a&gt; his experience signing up for the site. “A quick scroll down the Twitter-like home page and I was met with a picture of Joseph Goebbels, quotes from &lt;em&gt;Mein Kampf,&lt;/em&gt; pro-gun and anti-trans memes, and a series of posts by former B.N.P. leader &lt;strong&gt;Nick Griffin.&lt;/strong&gt; This was before I’d followed anyone, reposted anything, or been active in any way. This home page wasn’t based on any preferences of mine that Gab’s algorithm had learned&amp;#8212;it was a selection of posts that were popular with other users.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Although the site &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/crislopezg/status/981554978224566272\"&gt;advertised&lt;/a&gt; a strict no-tolerance policy against posts calling for violence, self-harm, or threatening language, moderation was often lax. Eventually, members were evicted for much more arbitrary reasons. Prominent white nationalist &lt;strong&gt;Paul Nehlen,&lt;/strong&gt; who challenged &lt;strong&gt;Paul Ryan&lt;/strong&gt; for his Wisconsin congressional seat, had a &lt;a href=\"https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Paul_Nehlen#Curt_Schilling_interview_and_subsequent_trolling\"&gt;rich history of anti-Semitic trolling&lt;/a&gt;, but was &lt;a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-white-nationalist-troll-ricky-vaughn_us_5ac53167e4b09ef3b2432627\"&gt;banned&lt;/a&gt; for doxxing one of Gab’s highest-profile members. In turn, Gab’s failure to enforce the rules often led its own members to deliberately test the limits of its policies, practically daring moderators to ban them. When prominent white nationalist &lt;strong&gt;Andrew Auernheimer,&lt;/strong&gt; also known as Weev, got booted, Gab’s users protested, saying the site tolerated far worse than him on a regular basis: “#gasthekikes is a constant statement on here and people are not getting banned, neither should Weev have been,” one &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/crislopezg/status/940986270729297921\"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The internal debate over exactly &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; much hate speech the community could tolerate reflects a broader argument within the right over how to spread their ideas throughout the Internet&amp;#8212;whether by &lt;a href=\"https://www.bellingcat.com/news/americas/2018/10/11/memes-infowars-75-fascist-activists-red-pilled/\"&gt;“red-pilling”&lt;/a&gt;, a.k.a. sneaking fascist, racist, or anti-Semitic views into larger society by presenting them as reasonable alternatives to apparently strident liberal voices (“social-justice warriors“), or by overt action, such as rallies and marches, neo-Nazi imagery, and racist chants. (&lt;strong&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/strong&gt; himself is a controversial figure in this debate, with some on the far right praising him for helping to “red-pill” the “normies,” while fascist activists accuse Trump and the far right of &lt;a href=\"https://www.bellingcat.com/news/americas/2018/10/11/memes-infowars-75-fascist-activists-red-pilled/\"&gt;“paralyzing the supply chain”&lt;/a&gt; by providing a moderate alternative to full-on Nazism.) The Charlottesville rally in 2017, which left a protester dead, was intended as a &lt;a href=\"https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2018/03/13/wake-richard-spencer%E2%80%99s-michigan-rally-racist-alt-right%E2%80%99s-infighting-over-optics-comes-head\"&gt;direct rebuke&lt;/a&gt; to the “optics cucks,” who preferred the former tactic. The debate became a major dividing point, apparently with extreme real-world consequences. Nehlen &lt;a href=\"http://www.rightwingwatch.org/post/not-even-white-nationalists-like-paul-nehlen-anymore/\"&gt;was a harsh critic&lt;/a&gt; of the “optics cucks.” Bowers, too, wrote “screw your optics” before he began his shooting.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For anyone who followed Gab and observed the stridency of its factions, it was little surprise that its commenters &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/MichaelEHayden/status/1056214722893221890\"&gt;quickly celebrated&lt;/a&gt; Bowers’s actions. “I can’t wait to hear about how many lampshades the alleged synagogue shooter made out [sic] these jews in Pittsburg,” wrote @EmilyAnderson, followed by three laughing cat emojis; another user predicted that Bowers’s statement&amp;#8212;“All these Jews have to die”&amp;#8212;would “be a meme as long as the Internet lives. Which wont [sic] be long after this LOL.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The revelation of Bowers’s horrifying online presence spurred tech companies to action: GoDaddy &lt;a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/gab-temporarily-shuts-down-after-godaddy-pulls-support-2018-10\"&gt;booted Gab&lt;/a&gt; from its platform; PayPal, Stripe, and Joyent &lt;a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/28/18034126/gab-social-network-stripe-joyent-deplatforming-hate-speech-pittsburgh-shooting\"&gt;de-platformed the site&lt;/a&gt;; Medium &lt;a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/nation-now/2018/10/29/gab-goes-offline-pittsburgh-synagogue-shooting/1804582002/\"&gt;removed&lt;/a&gt; Gab’s account. Some saw these companies’ hasty actions as hypocritical&amp;#8212;after all, they &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/KELLYWEILL/status/1056363310071926786\"&gt;claimed&lt;/a&gt;, the tech world had known about Gab’s Nazi problem for months, and done nothing. But the swift punishment did not quiet the Gab community. On the contrary, it seems to have validated the far right’s victimhood complex. “The attacks from the American press have been relentless for two years now and have taken a toll on me personally,” &lt;strong&gt;Ekrem Büyükkaya,&lt;/strong&gt; Gab’s C.T.O., &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/jaredlholt/status/1056577550074474496\"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; when he resigned from his position on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The site’s remaining members and supporters soon rallied behind their founder, painting themselves as casualties of another wave of media criticism. “None of you leftist lunatics are blaming the shooter. You guys can’t seem to grasp the concept of personal responsibility,” &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/AntAmerican88/status/1056888375788163072\"&gt;one user tweeted&lt;/a&gt;, in response to a &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2018/10/28/how-gab-became-white-supremacist-sanctuary-before-it-was-linked-pittsburgh-suspect/\"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; covering the shuttering of Gab.com. “It’s Gabs fault, it’s the presidents fault, it’s alt medias fault and on and on. Everyone is a victim, 0 responsibility.” (The tweet was re-tweeted by Gab’s account.)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But the existence of Gab reflects a larger &lt;a href=\"https://slate.com/technology/2017/08/the-alt-right-wants-to-build-its-own-internet.html\"&gt;trend on the right&lt;/a&gt;, wherein those banished from mainstream social-media sites create evermore extreme platforms on which to express themselves. Fox News initiated this trend more than two decades ago: the cable channel was &lt;a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/roger-ailes-how-cruelest-lesson-fueled-rise-fox-news-chief-n761676\"&gt;explicitly founded&lt;/a&gt; to offer a conservative take on the news, while Andrew Breitbart &lt;a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/11/breitbartcom-struggles-with-the-contradictions-of-its-namesake/264372/\"&gt;built his namesake site&lt;/a&gt; to cater to an even more conservative audience. The bigger the Internet has become, and the lower the cost of entry, the more likely sites like Gab.com and those further afield will proliferate&amp;#8212;not just as social hubs, but as an alternate Internet with its attendant-support networks. (Already, far-right crowd-funding sites like &lt;a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/hatreon-alt-right-richard-spencer-andrew-anglin-white-nationalism-white-644546\"&gt;Hatreon&lt;/a&gt; have popped up as alternatives to GoFundMe and Patreon, though they’re &lt;a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/far-right-fuming-after-big-finance-chokes-off-money-flow\"&gt;frequently kicked off&lt;/a&gt; of major payment platforms.) By insisting that Silicon Valley is unfairly suppressing and maligning the views of his “deplorables,” Trump has effectively created a feedback loop wherein the right’s persecution complex&amp;#8212;and its extremism&amp;#8212;grows more pronounced each time it is forced to decamp to a new online home. Where the cycle ends is anyone’s guess, but the story of Gab is far from over. “GAB IS NOT GOING ANYWHERE,” Torba &lt;a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2018/10/28/how-gab-became-white-supremacist-sanctuary-before-it-was-linked-pittsburgh-suspect/?utm_term=.e9bcc1513b9b\"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; on the now-defunct page. “I don’t care what we have to do, I don’t care what it takes.

Though the Supreme Court nominee now faces accusations from more than one woman, he told the conservative network that he was a virgin in high school, and remained one for years afterward. But as &lt;strong&gt;Seth Meyers&lt;/strong&gt; noted on a particularly merciless &lt;em&gt;Late Night&lt;/em&gt; segment, this defense is utterly irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;“It does not matter if you were a virgin,” Meyers said Tuesday night. “You are being accused of sexual assault, not sexual intercourse. Those things have nothing to do with each other. It’s the same as saying, ‘I couldn’t have robbed that bank; I’m a virgin.’”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Besides, “devoting yourself to celibacy doesn’t mean you can’t be a sexual assaulter; just ask thousands of priests.” As his audience groaned at the thought, Meyers challenged, “Ask them! Go ahead and ask them.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Meyers also had no time for Kavanaugh insisting that he is close with plenty of women, like the 65 who &lt;a href=\"https://www.apnews.com/1f7e47de5ce340f7b4cab8e92ef91cf0\"&gt;signed a letter of support&lt;/a&gt; for him. “Just because you are friends with one woman doesn’t mean you haven’t been awful to another,” Meyers said. “That’s like saying you’re a vegetarian because you didn’t eat your dog.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Legal representatives of &lt;strong&gt;Christine Blasey Ford,&lt;/strong&gt; Kavanaugh’s first accuser, have &lt;a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/09/25/brett-kavanaugh-ford-has-4-people-corroborate-sexual-assault-claims/1429270002/\"&gt;four signed and sworn statements&lt;/a&gt; corroborating her allegations. Meanwhile, Kavanaugh faces a &lt;a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/senate-democrats-investigate-a-new-allegation-of-sexual-misconduct-from-the-supreme-court-nominee-brett-kavanaughs-college-years-deborah-ramirez\"&gt;second allegation&lt;/a&gt; from his college years, with another accuser, a former U.S. Mint employee, &lt;a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/09/24/brett-kavanaugh-avenatti-third-accuser-emerge-48-hours/1416699002/\"&gt;possibly about to speak up&lt;/a&gt;. Kavanaugh has continually denied all the allegations against him.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Still, as Meyers noted on Tuesday night, Kavanaugh’s choice of outlet for his TV interview may have been misguided&amp;#8212;considering Fox News’s &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/09/roger-ailes-fox-news-final-days\"&gt;own history&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/04/fox-news-bill-oreilly\"&gt;sexual assault allegations&lt;/a&gt;, which is sordid enough to merit a &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/08/nicole-kidman-gretchen-carlson-roger-ailes-movie-margot-robbie\"&gt;movie adaptation&lt;/a&gt;. “Going to Fox News to prove you’re not a pervert,” Meyers said, “is like doing the word search to prove you’re smart.”&lt;/p&gt;","rubric":"last night on late night","socialTitle":"Seth Meyers Rips Brett Kavanaugh’s “Virgin” Defense to Shreds","socialDescription":"As the Late Night host pointed out, “You are being accused of sexual assault, not sexual intercourse.

Victimhood, according to this principle, is a liberal complex.","body":"&lt;section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;One winter during CPAC, the surreal, &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/02/commercialized-trumpified-cpac-is-adrift\"&gt;Super Bowl&amp;#8211;like&lt;/a&gt; conservative political conference that descends on Washington, D.C., every February, I found myself at the Cadillac Ranch for drinks with a trusted male source of mine, along with a male Republican lobbyist who I won’t name, and a female Republican lobbyist who I won’t name, either. It was clear to all involved that I was a reporter covering right-wing politics, and as such, I assumed, everyone would be on their best behavior, or at least something approximating it. Maybe I was naïve, because as we waited in line to enter the restaurant, I felt the lobbyist’s hand go up my skirt and grab my buttocks.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I brushed it away. It went up again, his thumb slipping into the waistband of my tights.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I felt the universe of acceptable responses closing in around me. At the time&amp;#8212;young, hungry, hoping to expand my network in a subdivision of the Washington political ecosystem that remains largely a boys’ club&amp;#8212;I classified my options this way: I could either ignore the assault and end up disrespected that evening (the weak option); slap him and call the authorities (the feminist option); or what seemed, at that moment, most likely to preserve my standing. I grabbed his wrist, shoved it away, and whirled around to face him. “It would be beneficial for the both of us if you stopped doing that,” I said calmly, aiming an icy, assured gaze at him for three seconds before walking away.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;“What does that mean?” he said, fear creeping onto his face. “&lt;em&gt;What does that mean?!&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;He apologized for his behavior, but within minutes, he changed tacks, yelling that he didn’t give a flying fuck about what anyone thought of him. I turned to my source. “How important is this man that I should put up with him grabbing my ass?”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;“You shouldn’t put up with &lt;em&gt;anyone&lt;/em&gt; grabbing your ass,” he said, and hauled me away. As we left without saying goodbye to anyone, the lout’s female friend chased after me: “He was drunk, he didn’t mean what he said, please come back&amp;#8212;we’re cool!”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The rules of being an ambitious woman in conservative circles (hammered into my brain as a college activist) rest on several unpleasant axioms. First: many men need rules, either dictated by society, religion, or ethics, to constrain them from behaving rudely sexist at best to monstrously piggish at worst&amp;#8212;but they can’t or won’t always follow them. Second: it falls on the woman to enforce these rules, predicting male misbehavior to ensure she does not become prey. Third&amp;#8212;and this is the point at which conservatives truly break from their liberal sisters: the best way to address misogyny is to ignore it. To sneer at male animalism, to reject self-pity, and above all else, to resist hysteria. Victimhood, according to this logic, is a liberal complex, and rising above it means rejecting such nonsense. Watching &lt;strong&gt;Kellyanne Conway&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/10/03/kellyanne-conway-says-she-didnt-plan-reveal-her-sexual-assault-wont-discuss-it-again/\"&gt;reveal&lt;/a&gt; in an interview last week that she, too, had been sexually assaulted, and that she sympathizes with other women who shared that pain, I could not help but observe the pride she seemed to take in having moved on. For many conservative women, this principle is a superior vision of female empowerment. (Republican congressman &lt;strong&gt;Kevin Cramer,&lt;/strong&gt; who is running for Senate in North Dakota, recently expressed a variant of this sentiment when he told &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; that his mother and mother-in-law “cannot understand this movement toward victimization” because they are “pioneers of the prairie” and “tough people whose grandparents were tough and great-grandparents were tough.”)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Republican officials felled by the #MeToo movement have largely been brought down by only the most extraordinary allegations. There was the anti-abortion congressman who &lt;a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2017/10/05/tim-murphy-resigns-from-congress-243510\"&gt;reportedly&lt;/a&gt; urged his mistress to have an abortion. There was another who was &lt;a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2018/04/06/rep-blake-farenthold-facing-ethics-probe-abruptly-resigns/\"&gt;forced out&lt;/a&gt; only when the House Ethics Committee took an interest in his alleged sexual harassment. (Farenthold denied any wrongdoing.) A third congressman, &lt;strong&gt;Trent Franks,&lt;/strong&gt; resigned after it was revealed he had pressured two of his female subordinates to &lt;a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2017/12/08/trent-franks-sex-surrogacy-impregnate-287808\"&gt;bear his surrogate children&lt;/a&gt; via sexual intercourse. But so many others, empowered by the G.O.P.’s implicit support for &lt;strong&gt;Roy Moore&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Jim Jordan,&lt;/strong&gt; to say nothing of &lt;strong&gt;Donald Trump,&lt;/strong&gt; likely remain in the shadows. For a while, I was chasing down a rumor that a prominent conservative activist was sending inappropriate mobile-phone pictures to women on a messaging app, but could not find anyone who wanted to talk. It’s possible that this tip was entirely untrue, but regardless I was struck by how little the women I spoke to were motivated by the #MeToo tidal wave that has swept through the business world in the past year. “Conservative women don’t feel &lt;em&gt;victimized,&lt;/em&gt;” a writer in the conservative world explained to me, “they just find creepy male behavior pathetic.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Admittedly, there is something empowering about putting a man down like that&amp;#8212;if you have the status to do so. But there’s so much silence one must put up with along the way. &lt;em&gt;Harper’s Bazaar&lt;/em&gt;’s &lt;strong&gt;Jennifer Wright,&lt;/strong&gt; writing from the outside, recently &lt;a href=\"https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/politics/a23453699/conservative-women-response-brett-kavanaugh-allegations-sexual-assault/\"&gt;suggested&lt;/a&gt; that conservative gender dynamics hinge on women trying to prove that “men (the really important people in the world) can totally come hang out with you, because you’re fun.” I don’t think that &lt;em&gt;itself&lt;/em&gt; is a conservative phenomenon&amp;#8212;this is, of course, the problem facing virtually every industry and political movement where men outnumber women.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But on the right, your competitive advantage as Not A Straight White Man is contingent on your willingness to excuse, offset, or provide cover for men. Many women I know in the movement, a number of whom battle the innuendo that their careers are the result of their looks, compartmentalize to stay sane, ignoring rampant sexism to maintain their station. On the right, of course, there&amp;#39;s another female archetype, one that totally owns the libs, but right-wing women would rather not contemplate: Sexy Gun Woman, a role exemplified by a photoshop of &lt;strong&gt;Sarah Palin&lt;/strong&gt; toting a rifle while wearing an American flag bikini.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Up until &lt;strong&gt;Brett Kavanaugh,&lt;/strong&gt; much of the right’s reckoning with #MeToo was spent celebrating the left’s supposed moral hypocrisy. &lt;strong&gt;Harvey Weinstein,&lt;/strong&gt; the first domino to fall, was a Democrat. (Alas, the mainstream historiography of #MeToo has largely ignored Roger Ailes, for decades the reigning titan of the conservative media world.) &lt;strong&gt;Al Franken&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;John Conyers&lt;/strong&gt; were Democrats, as were many of the media figures whose careers have ended in disgrace. Atop the heap lay the legacy of &lt;strong&gt;Bill Clinton,&lt;/strong&gt; only now being exhumed. “It’s difficult to overstate the extent to which conservative Americans have felt scolded and hectored,” argued &lt;strong&gt;David French&lt;/strong&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.nationalreview.com/2018/05/how-metoo-undermines-the-resistance/\"&gt;National Review&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; “So how do you expect us to react when it’s revealed that all too many of the self-appointed moralists weren’t just the kind of preachers who’d run off with the secretary, they were the kind of monsters who’d press a button in their office, lock the secretary in the room, and assault her?”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But the moral logic of the right does not lead conservatives to disown their own malefactors. On the contrary, in the zero-sum world of Republican politics, the existence of liberal scoundrels merely provides an additional reason to ignore the allegations against their own heroes. (Trump, who has denied some 16 allegations of sexual harassment or assault, recently &lt;a href=\"http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/why-trumps-new-criticisms-al-franken-matter\"&gt;mocked&lt;/a&gt; Franken for resigning, rather than standing his ground.) So it should not have come as a surprise, when Kavanaugh was accused by one, and then two, and then three women, that the G.O.P. circled the wagons. (Kavanaugh flatly denied any wrongdoing.)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The weeks of the Kavanaugh carnival dredged up every single trope I had encountered in my years reporting on conservative movements: the tokenism of having 65 women vouch for his character; the optics of 11 white men conducting their inquisition of Ford through a woman; the talking point, repeated by Trump, that one of the women was too drunk and must have misremembered what happened to her. When I rewatch Senator &lt;strong&gt;Susan Collins’s&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/in-fierce-speech-for-kavanaugh-collins-sheds-her-swing-vote-image/2018/10/05/3ab05984-c8de-11e8-9b1c-a90f1daae309_story.html?utm_term=.d576df9cd29d\"&gt;44-minute&lt;/a&gt; justification of her vote for Kavanaugh, I do not see a woman consciously thinking that she needs to go along to get along with her male-dominant colleagues; I see a woman arguing her way out of her feelings in the pedantic language of due process and Democratic hypocrisy. Behind it all lurked the Republican notion that the left is playing dirty by weaponizing women’s pain.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Conservative women, of course, aren’t the only ones who grapple with this issue. In her 2009 book, &lt;em&gt;The Trump Card,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Ivanka Trump,&lt;/strong&gt; then a Democrat, &lt;a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2016/9/6/12815178/ivanka-trump-sexual-harassment\"&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt; about the complexities of responding to harassment. “It would put me into an uncomfortable, no-win situation,” she says. “If I ignored the inappropriate remarks, I might come across as weak. If I responded too harshly, I’d be a tightly wound witch.” But it is impossible to overstate the overriding sense, on the right, that this pain is all part of some political game. Over the past several weeks, as the Kavanaugh confirmation battle dragged on, I had several constructive conversations with conservatives about sexual harassment and assault&amp;#8212;but only when I explicitly divorced our talks from the charged politics of the confirmation, itself.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Perhaps they had so aggressively absorbed the lessons of the Clinton years, when Democrats contorted themselves to excuse the president’s misbehavior, that they could not see that the left has changed: that Democrats are now cleaning house in (mostly) good faith. But the Kavanaugh drama, and much else, shows that the G.O.P. has a lot further to go. During the heat of the debate, I spoke to a pundit source of mine who noted that his more centrist friends&amp;#8212;the ones who had been critical of Trump, and the ones who had been perhaps inclined to listen to a woman who had been sexually assaulted&amp;#8212;found themselves back on Kavanaugh’s side because of the intensity of the Democrats’ attacks. (They would not talk to me, on or off the record, to explain their thinking.) By the time Kavanaugh was confirmed, 50&amp;#8211;48, spontaneous parties erupted throughout Washington, D.C., with Republicans happily &lt;a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/remysmidt/beers-for-brett-kavanaugh-supreme-court-confirmation\"&gt;sharing photos of themselves&lt;/a&gt; getting drunk on beer in solidarity. Victory, after all, requires rubbing the loser’s face in it, and angering the liberals by celebrating Kavanaugh’s love of drink&amp;#8212;and, implicitly, the inebriation that is the cause of so much misery&amp;#8212;was the sweetest celebration of all. Libs were owned, for sure&amp;#8212;but so were right-wing women.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;","rubric":"#MeToo","socialTitle":"“Conservative Women Don’t Feel Victimized”: How the Kavanaugh Nomination Underscored the Right’s Complex Inability to Cope with the #MeToo Reckoning","socialDescription":"The rules of being a conservative woman in politics require you to never consider yourself the victim of sexual assault.

a reason Rupert Murdoch has been called a modern-day Sun\nKing. In Murdoch’s media empire, which includes News Corp. and Twentieth Century Fox, everything revolves around him. Hundreds of newspaper properties around the world lead back to the Australian-born billionaire, who has been credited with “inventing the modern tabloid” in the course of his ascendancy from local broadsheet owner to global news baron.\n&lt;p&gt;Murdoch started small, taking the Southern Australian &lt;em&gt;Adelaide News,&lt;/em&gt; the family-owned daily he received upon his father’s death, and turning it into a regional success. Still in his early 20s, Murdoch expanded quickly, buying up other newspapers and boosting their numbers with his trademark focus on sex, sports, and scandal.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Over the next several years, his empire grew to include media properties in New Zealand, Britain, and finally, the United States, where he bought the &lt;em&gt;San Antonio Express-News,&lt;/em&gt; founded the supermarket tabloid &lt;em&gt;Star,&lt;/em&gt; and eventually purchased the &lt;em&gt;New York Post&lt;/em&gt; and publisher HarperCollins. In the 1980s, he extended his dominion to include television, too, buying a stake in Twentieth Century Fox and, in 1990, forming British Sky Broadcasting (now known as Sky, the U.K.’s largest pay-TV broadcaster).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Murdoch, now in his 80s, has an aggressive editorial sensibility that has made him a bête noire to some. On the left, he is often pilloried for his conservative ideology, which he has worked to popularize through right-leaning outlets like &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; and Fox News. And his inclination to court controversy has sometimes crossed into the criminal realm: in 2011, Murdoch’s &lt;em&gt;News of the World,&lt;/em&gt; among other companies, was accused of bribery and phone hacking to get scoops, leading to him being investigated by both the British government and the F.B.I. In 2012, he resigned as director of News International and from several other companies connected to it. (Murdoch doesn’t shy from more personal scandals either, divorcing his third wife, Wendi Deng, amid rumors she had an affair with Tony Blair, and recently marrying former model Jerry Hall, 25 years his junior.) In 2015, it was announced that Murdoch would be stepping down as the C.E.O. of 21st Century Fox, handing his two sons, James and Lachlan, the keys to the kingdom. Still, Murdoch by all reports is still firmly in charge of his empire, despite frequent questions about a plan of succession.&lt;/p&gt;","socialMedia":[],"photos":{"tout":[{"aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":1400,"height":700,"format":"JPEG","url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2016/06/01/574f478f0f807a3a48c7150a_hive-contributor-profile-rupert-murdoch.jpg"}},"revisionCreatedAt":"June 1, 2016 4:37 pm","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","image":true},"revisionAuthor":"Kelly Butler","filename":"hive-contributor-profile-rupert-murdoch.jpg","_embedded":{"categories-channels":[],"variantXsmall":[],"variantSmall":[],"variantMedium":[],"variantLarge":[],"variantXlarge":[],"_categories":{}},"title":"hive-contributor-profile-rupert-murdoch.jpg","credit":"From REX/Shutterstock.","_links":{},"id":"574f478fb1a9903a488277a2","createdAt":"June 1, 2016 4:37 pm","revision":2,"modifiedAt":"June 1, 2016 4:37 pm","contributors":{}}]},"pubDate":"May 25, 2017 11:21 am","url":"/people/rupert-murdoch","mainPhotoContributors":{},"_embedded":{"photosTout":[{"fields":{"aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":1400,"height":700,"format":"JPEG","url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2016/06/01/574f478f0f807a3a48c7150a_hive-contributor-profile-rupert-murdoch.jpg"}},"revisionCreatedAt":"June 1, 2016 4:37 pm","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","image":true},"revisionAuthor":"Kelly Butler","filename":"hive-contributor-profile-rupert-murdoch.jpg","_embedded":{"categories-channels":[],"variantXsmall":[],"variantSmall":[],"variantMedium":[],"variantLarge":[],"variantXlarge":[],"_categories":{}},"title":"hive-contributor-profile-rupert-murdoch.jpg","credit":"From REX/Shutterstock.","_links":{},"id":"574f478fb1a9903a488277a2","createdAt":"June 1, 2016 4:37 pm","revision":2,"modifiedAt":"June 1, 2016 4:37 pm","contributors":{}}}],"contributorsAuthor":[],"contributorsPhotographer":[],"_categories":{},"publishHistory":{"entityId":"574f479cbdf148e4205f29e5","revision":0,"pubDate":"May 25, 2017 11:21 am","revisionAuthor":"Charles Truelson","searchable":true,"expired":false,"createdAt":"May 25, 2017 11:21 am","uri":"people/rupert-murdoch"},"related":[{}]},"relatedItems":{"items":[{"hed":"“He’s Energized”: A New Clue Points to James Murdoch’s Post-Fox Plans","promoHed":"“He’s Energized”: A New Clue Points to James Murdoch’s Post-Fox Plans","dek":"With the Disney-Fox merger speeding toward a close, Rupert Murdoch’s younger son is finally stepping out from under his father’s shadow.

All signs point to a new life as a V.C.","body":"&lt;p&gt;With Disney’s $71 billion takeover of the bulk of 21st Century Fox coasting toward an anticipated closing in the early part of next year, the media-obsessed have taken to their venerable sport of gaming out the coming changes in the upper ranks of the soon-to-be-combined mega-behemoth. “Who stays and who goes, people jockeying for positions&amp;#8212;that’s the story,” one veteran media executive told me recently.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But perhaps the most intriguing question of all concerns someone who is already known to be going: 21st Century Fox C.E.O. &lt;strong&gt;James Murdoch.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Rupert Murdoch’s&lt;/strong&gt; younger son was originally seen as being up for one of the top jobs at Disney, as well as a potential heir to &lt;strong&gt;Bob Iger&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#8212;who has run the company since 2005, and, with the Fox deal nearing completion, is now widely considered to be the most powerful man in media. But it became clear in the spring that James would, in fact, be taking a different path. As part of a strategic reorganization announced in March, top Disney executives &lt;strong&gt;Kevin Mayer&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Bob Chapek&lt;/strong&gt; were elevated to expanded roles that appeared to mark them as the two most likely Iger successors. By May, &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; was &lt;a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/james-murdoch-wouldnt-move-to-disney-if-fox-deal-closes-1525824120\"&gt;reporting&lt;/a&gt; that Murdoch “has begun to tell associates that he isn’t going to Disney.” Later that month, when &lt;strong&gt;Peter Kafka&lt;/strong&gt; prodded Murdoch about his plans &lt;a href=\"https://www.recode.net/2018/5/30/17397110/21st-century-fox-james-murdoch-transcript-code-2018\"&gt;onstage at a Recode conference in Southern California&lt;/a&gt;, the most he was able to get out of his interview subject was, “It’s been kind of the five-year mark since I moved back to New York, so I think it’s time to do something new.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Ever since, the hot speculation has been that Murdoch is going to set up a venture-capital fund. He hasn’t confirmed this publicly, but in media circles, the whispers about Murdoch’s plans are getting louder. One new tea leaf, several people familiar with the matter told me, is that Murdoch has committed to an office space in downtown Manhattan for after he leaves Fox. (Murdoch has been clear about staying on as C.E.O. until the deal closes.) One source told me Murdoch wants to “invest in a handful of efforts” in media, tech, and other areas, and that the planned space is large enough that it could potentially accommodate small start-ups. “I think he’s looking forward to getting on with it. He’s energized,” this person said.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, the musical chairs of the Disney-Fox mash-up is well underway. President of 21st Century Fox, &lt;strong&gt;Peter Rice,&lt;/strong&gt; and Fox Television Group chair &lt;strong&gt;Dana Walden&lt;/strong&gt; are &lt;a href=\"https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/disney-21st-century-fox-peter-rice-dana-walden-ben-sherwood-1202875155/\"&gt;reportedly&lt;/a&gt; poised to assume senior roles at Disney overseeing television operations. &lt;strong&gt;Ben Sherwood,&lt;/strong&gt; meanwhile, who has run the Disney-ABC Television Group since 2015, is &lt;a href=\"https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/ben-sherwood-disney-abc-exit-1202943366/\"&gt;reportedly&lt;/a&gt; set to leave the company upon the close of the deal. Two weeks ago, 21st Century Fox announced that after the ink dries, general counsel &lt;strong&gt;Gerson Zweifach&lt;/strong&gt; will return to his former firm, Williams &amp;amp; Connolly, and &lt;a href=\"https://deadline.com/2018/09/ben-sherwood-exit-disney-abc-fox-acquisition-1202469628/\"&gt;Deadline says&lt;/a&gt; Disney is expected to confirm which 21st Century Fox honchos are joining the Iger empire as early as October 1. One particularly noteworthy matter, as a long-standing member of the corporate-media class suggested to me this week, involves who will get to make programming decisions for the company’s streaming video services, which are the new front in the content wars being waged between legacy media players and technology giants like Netflix, Apple, and Amazon. As for the company tentatively titled New Fox, which will include Fox News, the Fox broadcast stations, and several other assets not going to Disney, the executive appointments so far include &lt;strong&gt;Lachlan Murdoch&lt;/strong&gt; as C.E.O. and &lt;strong&gt;John Nallen,&lt;/strong&gt; the current chief financial officer of 21st Century Fox, as chief operating officer.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Through a spokesman, James Murdoch declined to comment. But one gets a sense of where Murdoch’s head is at from people who know him well. On the Recode Media &lt;a href=\"https://www.recode.net/2018/8/23/17770898/jason-hirschhorn-recode-media-peter-kafka-podcast-full-transcript\"&gt;podcast last month&lt;/a&gt;, Kafka asked &lt;strong&gt;Jason Hirschhorn,&lt;/strong&gt; C.E.O. of Redef and a friend of Murdoch’s since high school, for some insight into Murdoch’s turn away from Disney. “I don’t want to betray any confidences. I was surprised,” Hirschhorn said. “He was the heir apparent. It was a confusing time over there . . . It’s been rumored that James is going to do something on the V.C. front . . . If you’re James Murdoch and you grew up” spending most of your life working for your father, “and you’re always compared to your father, and no matter how smart&amp;#8212;you may be a captain of industry anywhere else, [but] you’re still Rupert’s son. Maybe James thought, ‘It’s time for me to do my own thing.’”&lt;/p&gt;","rubric":"The Murdochs","socialTitle":"“He’s Energized”: A New Clue Points to James Murdoch’s Post-Fox Plans","socialDescription":"With the Disney-Fox merger speeding toward a close, Rupert Murdoch’s younger son is finally stepping out from under his father’s shadow.

Everett&lt;/strong&gt; spent years laboring over &lt;em&gt;The Happy Prince,&lt;/em&gt; a film about Oscar Wilde’s difficult final days set shortly before the celebrated Irish author and playwright died in exile, after being imprisoned on charges of “gross indecency.” Now, after a protracted development process that began &lt;a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/cannes-rupert-everett-oscar-wilde-327201\"&gt;in 2012&lt;/a&gt;, the film is finally about to open in theaters. But Everett, who performed triple duty on the film&amp;#8212;he not only stars, but also wrote and directed it&amp;#8212;wants potential audiences to know that this movie is more than a typical passion project.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;“It’s a film for the Trump era in a way, because it’s a film about what society does to a man&amp;#8212;how society can punish a man just for being homosexual,” Everett said at a Cinema Society screening of his film at iPic Theater in Manhattan Monday night. “Now, we have a very comfortable life, but you never know what’s going to happen in America next, or anywhere. As a minority, you always have to be vigilant.” Indeed, Everett added, the global fight for L.G.B.T.Q. rights is still far from over&amp;#8212;just look at countries like &lt;a href=\"https://www.vox.com/first-person/2018/6/15/17468282/world-cup-fifa-russia-2018-lgbt-rights\"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;That said, Everett also acknowledged the intensely personal aspects of the film&amp;#8212;and why Wilde’s story resonates so deeply with him. “I think, for me personally, he’s a very important historical figure, who’s a gay person who’s worked in a largely heterosexual world,” he said. “He’s like a patron-saint figure. That’s why I’ve always been very attached to him.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;At the screening, Everett thanked other attendees, including &lt;strong&gt;Julianne Moore,&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Colin Firth,&lt;/strong&gt;

So it makes sense that &lt;strong&gt;Hope Hicks&lt;/strong&gt; is heading west to serve as chief communications officer for “New Fox,” the parent company of Fox News, based in Los Angeles. Hicks, a 29-year-old former P.R. flack, had experienced a &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/08/hope-hicks-plots-her-next-act\"&gt;difficult time&lt;/a&gt; in New York after exiting &lt;strong&gt;Donald Trump’s&lt;/strong&gt; White House at the end of March. She was hounded by &lt;a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5982431/Hope-Hicks-Rob-Porter-seen-Central-Park.html\"&gt;paparazzi&lt;/a&gt;, who photographed her jogging in Central Park with &lt;strong&gt;Rob Porter,&lt;/strong&gt; her West Wing office romance, who left the White House after allegations of spousal abuse surfaced (Porter denied it). And she’s also had to spend time and six figures on legal fees, (apparently funded by the Republican National Committee), dealing with &lt;strong&gt;Robert Mueller’s&lt;/strong&gt; investigation. The opportunity to work for the Murdochs on another coast would be a chance for a reset.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Until Trump’s presidency, working in the White House was a guaranteed ticket to plum jobs in the private sector. West Wing officials, gilded résumés in hand, transitioned easily to investment banks, media companies, and universities. Like a lot of Trump alumni, Hicks had a more challenging time. “It’s the Trump taint,” one former West Wing official told me. She took a lot of meetings, but the big offers didn’t roll in. “She said she was looking for a big job in media and investment banks,” one executive who met with her recalled. At one point it &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/02/trump-rob-porter-hope-hicks-john-kelly\"&gt;appeared&lt;/a&gt; like she might even go back to the White House and replace the embattled chief of staff, &lt;strong&gt;John Kelly.&lt;/strong&gt; (Hicks declined to comment.)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But the Trump-Kushner nexus finally came through. In August, Page Six &lt;a href=\"https://pagesix.com/2018/08/01/hope-hicks-dines-with-manhattan-power-broker/\"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that Hicks had lunch at Avra on the Upper East Side with media banker &lt;strong&gt;Aryeh Bourkoff,&lt;/strong&gt; the C.E.O. of LionTree and a close friend of &lt;strong&gt;Jared Kushner’s&lt;/strong&gt; (during the 2016 presidential campaign, Kushner reportedly had &lt;a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/18/us/politics/donald-trump-tv-jared-kushner.html\"&gt;conversations&lt;/a&gt; with Bourkoff about launching Trump TV). Around this time, Hicks began talks with &lt;strong&gt;Lachlan Murdoch,&lt;/strong&gt; who is becoming chairman and C.E.O. of New Fox, the slimmed-down media company comprised of assets the Murdochs did not sell to Disney. Sources said Trump and Kushner put in calls to &lt;strong&gt;Rupert Murdoch&lt;/strong&gt; to recommend Hicks.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Two weeks ago, Hicks had offers from both Bourkoff and Fox, sources said. In the end, working for Fox across the country was the more attractive opportunity. It’s unclear what this means for her relationship with Porter, who’s so far been unable to find a job, a former West Wing colleague told me. “It’s a big job. Plus she gets to move to L.A.,” a friend said. Although, of course, since she’s working for Fox, which often works for Trump, it’s in another sense not a fresh start at all.&lt;/p&gt;","rubric":"White House","socialTitle":"“She Gets to Move to L.A.”: The Backstory of Hope Hicks’s Bolt to Fox ","socialDescription":"Trump and Jared Kushner lobbied Rupert Murdoch to hire Hicks as chief communications officer—a big job, but still in the family.","seoTitle":"“She Gets to Move to L.A.”: The Backstory of Hope Hicks’s Bolt to Fox on the West Coast","seoDescription":"Trump and Jared Kushner lobbied Rupert Murdoch to hire Hicks as chief communications officer—a big job, but still in the family.","channel":"News","subChannel":"Politics","issueDate":"","ledeCaption":"","contentSource":"web","canonicalUrl":"","contentType":"","textMimeType":"","tags":["hope hicks"],"revisionAuthor":"Jarondakie Patrick","meta":{"collectionName":"articles","modelName":"article","publishable":true,"identifiable":true,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":true,"hierarchical":false},"interactiveOverride":"","id":"5bbcdc1c87834306acdc69e3","revision":8,"createdAt":"October 9, 2018 12:49 pm","modifiedAt":"October 9, 2018 1:01 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"October 9, 2018 1:01 pm","_embedded":{"categories-channels":[{"fields":{"name":"News","slug":"news","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5ae9f11fc994fd6b2518e1a7","revision":0,"createdAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modifiedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}},{"fields":{"name":"Politics","slug":"politics","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5ae9f120dc5a49785309c3b5","revision":0,"createdAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modifiedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}}],"categories-tags":[{"fields":{"name":"hope hicks","slug":"hope-hicks","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5b4cb7ea6c0055288786d9fc","revision":0,"createdAt":"July 16, 2018 11:21 am","modifiedAt":"July 16, 2018 11:21 am","revisionCreatedAt":"July 16, 2018 11:21 am","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}}],"contributorsAuthor":[{"fields":{"revisionAuthor":"Jarondakie Patrick","name":"Gabriel Sherman","bio":"Gabriel Sherman is a special correspondent for &lt;em&gt;Vanity Fair.&lt;/em&gt; Most recently, Sherman served as national-affairs editor at &lt;em&gt;New York&lt;/em&gt; magazine, and he is a regular contributor to NBC News and MSNBC.

And, so more than ever, Trump remains the network’s main programmer.","body":"&lt;p&gt;Shortly before Fox News C.E.O. Roger Ailes was fired, in July 2016, after dozens of women accused him of sexual harassment, he delivered a warning to his boss, Rupert Murdoch. “Trump gets great ratings, but if you’re not careful, he is going to end up totally controlling Fox News,” Ailes said, a source briefed on the conversation recently recalled. “Roger was highly annoyed with Trump. He couldn’t contain him at all,” a high-level Fox staffer remembered.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But now there’s a new boss in charge&amp;#8212;sort of. His name is Lachlan Murdoch. In May, Rupert named Lachlan, his elder son, chairman and C.E.O. of “New Fox,” the slimmed-down parent company that will emerge out of the Murdochs’ $71 billion deal to sell most of their entertainment assets to Disney. Lachlan, 47, is the heir that Rupert most wanted to succeed him even though, of the candidates in the family, Lachlan seemed to want the job least. He’s never been a political junkie like his father, an overt careerist like younger brother James, or a rebellious entrepreneur like older sister Liz. In 2005, Lachlan famously walked away from the company after clashing with Ailes and former C.O.O. Peter Chernin and moved back to the family’s native Australia.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Having returned to the fold, Lachlan has so far been content to be a caretaker rather than an empire builder. Although his nameplate was installed on an office at Fox News several months ago, Lachlan, who ran the &lt;em&gt;New York Post&lt;/em&gt; in the 1990s, mostly is an absentee manager, choosing instead to work from the company’s Los Angeles office. When he occasionally drops in on Fox’s morning editorial meeting, he doesn’t cut a big presence. “He’s polite and asks questions about the news. He’s respectful and comes off as someone trying to learn,” one attendee said. In fact, Lachlan’s highest-profile decision was to hire Donald Trump’s former communications director, Hope Hicks, to be New Fox’s spokesperson. He didn’t know Hicks well&amp;#8212;they had met only a handful of times&amp;#8212;but he was encouraged by Trump and Jared Kushner to hire her. “It seems like he was doing Trump a favor,” one Fox journalist said.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;With Lachlan content to let the Fox News machine run, the hand on the wheel belongs to Fox News C.E.O. Suzanne Scott. Scott’s management style is to effectively let the network’s producers run their shows independently. “No one is in charge,” a former executive told me. Without clear direction from the top, it’s every man for himself.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Fox’s hugely successful alliance with Trump has amplified divisions and rivalries among Fox’s on-air talent. Shepard Smith has emerged as the network’s most visible capital-&lt;em&gt;J&lt;/em&gt;  journalist and quasi-ombudsman. He’s used his three P.M. newscast to debunk Trump conspiracies, like the Uranium One obsession, and give airtime to investigative stories such as &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;’s 14,000-word exposé on Trump’s alleged tax dodging. Sean Hannity has called Smith “clueless” and “so anti-Trump.” At Mar-a-Lago in April, Hannity was overheard trashing Smith to Trump, according to one person familiar with the conversation. “Hannity was denouncing Shep, and Trump was eating it up.” (Hannity denied making the remarks.) Behind the scenes, Smith has taken on a bigger role in shaping Fox’s news coverage and critiques stories he doesn’t like, something that’s rankled some executives. “He’s the one who’s power hungry. He’s trying to pull the place left,” one former executive said. (A Fox News spokesperson disputes this.) Access to Trump also stokes jealousies among hosts. Sources say business anchor Neil Cavuto has complained to colleagues about Lou Dobbs’s closeness with the president. (A Fox News spokesperson says this is “not true.”)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"callout small\" data-type=\"callout\"&gt;&lt;div class=\"embed image row\"&gt;&lt;figure class=\"embedded-image\" data-type=\"image\"&gt;&lt;div class=\"pinterest-link-container\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5bd2305d005a606878515eec/master/h_450,c_limit/cable-news-sherman-dec-2018-embed01.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-pin-desc=\"\" data-pin-credits=\"\"/&gt;&lt;a class=\"pinterest-link\" href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vanityfair.com%2Fnews%2F2018%2F10%2Finside-trumps-new-fox-takeover&amp;amp;media=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.vanityfair.com%2Fphotos%2F5bd2305d005a606878515eec%2Fmaster%2Fh_450%2Cc_limit%2Fcable-news-sherman-dec-2018-embed01.png&amp;amp;description=\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump’s dominance of Fox is partly an accident, as a result of the lack of strong internal leadership. And, of course, in ratings terms, it’s been a happy accident. But the outcome is precisely the one Ailes had warned against: the network’s identity is now inseparable from that of the president, a development that would have surely horrified Ailes. Ailes may have been a right-winger, but he was sophisticated enough to know that Fox needed enough plausible distance from the subjects it covers to maintain the fiction of being “Fair &amp;amp; Balanced.” Now Fox is effectively an arm of the White House. Trump derives “policy” ideas from segments he likes and counts Sean Hannity as one of his closest advisers. The administration can feel like a Fox greenroom on a heavy news day. John Bolton serves as Trump’s national-security adviser; former Fox contributor Ben Carson runs HUD; former &lt;em&gt;Fox &amp;amp; Friends&lt;/em&gt; newsreader Heather Nauert serves as State Department spokesperson; and former Fox president Bill Shine is deputy chief of staff for communications. (Hannity lobbied for him to get the job.) Fox military analyst General Jack Keane has been discussed inside the West Wing as a successor to Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, a former White House official said. One Fox personality literally got into bed with the Trumps: former &lt;em&gt;The Five&lt;/em&gt; co-host Kimberly Guilfoyle is dating Don junior.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For hosts and producers, it’s a strange, though not entirely unfamiliar, environment. Fox hosts regularly get calls from Trump about segments he likes&amp;#8212;or doesn’t. “When you worked at Fox, you knew that at any moment Roger Ailes was watching. Every day was like a job interview with Ailes. Now it’s the same way for Trump,” says a veteran Fox News contributor. According to sources, Trump doesn’t explicitly dictate talking points the way Ailes did, but over time the effect can be similar. “What he usually does is he’ll call after a show and say, ‘I really enjoyed that,’” a former Fox anchor told me. “The highest compliment is ‘I really learned something.’ Then you know he got a new policy idea.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The fact that the news staff knows Trump always could be tuning in means the network is being programmed for an audience of one. “He has the same embattled view as a typical Fox viewer&amp;#8212;that ‘the liberal elites hate me; they’re trying to bring me down,’ ” the former executive said. At times, anchors will use Fox segments to send messages directly to Trump. The day &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reported Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein discussed tape-recording Trump to rally support amongst the Cabinet to invoke the 25th Amendment, Hannity told Trump the article was a trap to bait him into firing Rosenstein.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"callout small\" data-type=\"callout\"&gt;&lt;div class=\"embed image row\"&gt;&lt;figure class=\"embedded-image\" data-type=\"image\"&gt;&lt;div class=\"pinterest-link-container\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5bd2305a7473bd560f08b0ca/master/h_450,c_limit/cable-news-sherman-dec-2018-embed02.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-pin-desc=\"\" data-pin-credits=\"\"/&gt;&lt;a class=\"pinterest-link\" href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vanityfair.com%2Fnews%2F2018%2F10%2Finside-trumps-new-fox-takeover&amp;amp;media=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.vanityfair.com%2Fphotos%2F5bd2305a7473bd560f08b0ca%2Fmaster%2Fh_450%2Cc_limit%2Fcable-news-sherman-dec-2018-embed02.jpg&amp;amp;description=\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"caption callout-image-caption\"&gt;&lt;div class=\"wrapper\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"credits\"&gt;Photo by Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty Images.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rupert Murdoch’s relationship with Trump, and his network’s importance in maintaining the protective bubble of propaganda around the president, is one of some irony. Murdoch has wanted a personal relationship with an American president ever since he decamped from London to New York, in the 1970s (he was not particularly close with George W. Bush, the last Republican to hold the office). With Trump, he’s achieved that goal&amp;#8212;though he has told friends he thinks Trump is a “buffoon” and his strongest personal allegiances (much like Trump’s, actually) are to the elites that Trump uses as his whipping boys. But Murdoch prizes profits above ideology, so he accommodated Trump in order to preserve access. Before the inauguration, I reported that Trump asked Murdoch to submit names for the position of F.C.C. commissioner. (Murdoch denied it at the time.)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The question for Lachlan going forward is the same one that has vexed the Republican Party in the age of Trump: when to break from Trump, if a divorce is even possible. At moments there have been frays in the bond, as when Trump doted on Vladimir Putin in Helsinki (Neil Cavuto called it “disgusting”) or attacked Brett Kavanaugh’s accuser Dr. Christine Blasey Ford (a &lt;em&gt;Fox &amp;amp; Friends&lt;/em&gt; host said Trump “chose to blow it”). This fall, panic swept through Fox’s executive ranks as it looked like Democrats had a chance to retake both the House and the Senate. “They are deathly afraid of the Dems taking the House,” one high-level staffer said. The fear, according to the staffer, is that congressional committees investigating the Trump White House could draw in Fox. “Fox is hiring lobbyists to prepare,” the staffer said. Ominously for both Fox and the president, Trump’s rallies are not drawing the numbers they once did. As Politico reported, a Trump rally on August 30, carried live in Tucker Carlson’s regular prime-time slot, drew only 2.5 million viewers, whereas Carlson had been averaging more than 2.8 million. More recently, as Trump has been barnstorming ahead of the midterms, Fox has only been dipping into his rallies.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But mostly, Fox doesn’t have much of a choice when it comes to Trump. And why not? On the day Kavanaugh shouted his way through his Senate Judiciary Committee testimony, Fox attracted a near-record 5.7 million viewers&amp;#8212;more than MSNBC and CNN combined.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;More from our Special Report on the State of Cable News:&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212; How MSNBC gamified &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/11/how-msnbc-created-a-cable-news-addiction-epidemic\"&gt;cable news into addiction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212; Inside CNN’s massive &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/11/inside-the-trump-gold-rush-at-cnn\"&gt;Trump gold rush&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"embed cneembed\"&gt;&lt;div class=\"embed block cneembed\" data-url=\"//player.cnevids.com/script/video/5bbe9f3a625710412d00003b.js?muted=1\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;","rubric":"From the Magazine","socialTitle":"“No One Is in Charge”: Inside Trump’s New Fox Takeover","socialDescription":"Lachlan Murdoch, now installed at Fox News, is a caretaker rather than an empire builder.

But Kushner went ahead with it as planned. And then he hung with Rupert.","body":"&lt;p&gt;On Monday afternoon, &lt;strong&gt;Jared Kushner&lt;/strong&gt; wore a tight smile across his face as he strode offstage following a live interview with CNN’s &lt;strong&gt;Van Jones.&lt;/strong&gt; Their conversation, which took place at the Time Warner Center, in Columbus Circle, was among the most significant draws of the network’s first-ever Citizen by CNN event&amp;#8212;a full-day live affair featuring conversations with newsmakers, as interviewed by the network’s talent, all broadcast live on air and across the Internet. The event, it seemed, was both intended to break news and serve as Kushner’s cable-news debut, in his first sit-down since his father-in-law took office.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Citizen by CNN roster was stacked with power players from across the aisle&amp;#8212;House Speaker &lt;strong&gt;Nancy Pelosi,&lt;/strong&gt; Senator &lt;strong&gt;Jeff Flake,&lt;/strong&gt; Chicago Mayor and Obama chief of staff &lt;strong&gt;Rahm Emanuel,&lt;/strong&gt; former Trump White House lawyer &lt;strong&gt;Ty Cobb,&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Bob Woodward,&lt;/strong&gt; who wrote the barn-burning book exposing some of the most horrific accounts of a dysfunctional Trump West Wing. The Jones-Kushner conversation was also a useful case in point. The two men represented the opposite ends of the political spectrum&amp;#8212;Kushner works for the Republican president; Jones is a liberal pundit&amp;#8212;but have been working together on roundtables and policy discussions surrounding Kushner’s prison-reform initiative in the West Wing. It was also a fantastic publicity magnet. Despite his political ubiquity, Kushner remains an enigma, even to many of the political-media insiders who packed the room, many of whom still didn’t know what his voice sounded like.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The event was scheduled well before the Trump administration was embroiled in the fallout surrounding the death of &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; journalist Jamal Khashoggi, which has put a strain between Kushner and Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince &lt;strong&gt;Mohammed bin Salman.&lt;/strong&gt; While much has been speculated about Kushner’s evolving relationship with M.B.S., who he has cultivated as an ally since Trump took office, Kushner had yet to say anything publicly. This weekend, people close to Kushner weighed whether or not he should cancel his CNN appearance, they said, but Kushner decided to go on as planned.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It was a calculated P.R. move in the midst of what has been a treacherous month. Kushner could, perhaps, score some points for Team Trump by appearing at an event put on by CNN, which the president has long construed as inimical territory. Kushner himself had tussled with the network during the campaign, clashing with CNN president &lt;strong&gt;Jeff Zucker&lt;/strong&gt; over Trump coverage during the summer of 2016. They later reached a détente in a pre-election sit-down in the same building where Kushner got onstage Monday, according to people familiar with the situation. The conversation with Van Jones offered another, mutually beneficial denouement. Kushner, who many had hoped might be a moderating voice in the administration, presented himself as more of a pragmatist than a partisan, though the longtime Democrat made it clear he agrees with his father-in-law more often than many might have figured. “I agree with a lot of the things he’s pushing for,” he told Jones, when asked about his influence and ability to sway Trump. “I’ll make the case on certain things and&amp;#8212;but he’ll do what he wants to do. . . . lot of the things we have done have made the country better.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;That he had a comfortable relationship with Jones made it less daunting. They spent a fair amount of time talking about “how Kushner’s mind works”; he brought up the fact that Kushner had recently been called a ”hidden genius,” and wondered how he score ”the dopest job in the world.” He lobbed softballs about being married to &lt;strong&gt;Ivanka Trump&lt;/strong&gt; and asked, “Are you having fun?” Kushner, meanwhile, dodged specifics when Jones did ask about the Khashoggi affair. (Kushner insisted that the administration was still in the “fact-finding phase . . . [to] determine which facts are credible” and qualified the concerns over the reliability of the Saudi account by joking that he sees “things that are deceptive every day.”)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Kushner made clear that he is not the one calling the shots&amp;#8212;that the president, Secretary of State &lt;strong&gt;Mike Pompeo,&lt;/strong&gt; and National Security Adviser &lt;strong&gt;John Bolton&lt;/strong&gt; are the ones taking the reins and that his responsibilities within the West Wing do not include the &lt;em&gt;entire&lt;/em&gt; Middle East; he explained that he has been tasked with the Middle East peace process and that others are responsible for the rest. Privately, however, Kushner has &lt;a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/22/world/middleeast/kushner-khashoggi-prince-mbs.html\"&gt;communicated with M.B.S. several times&lt;/a&gt; over the last week. Because of his relationship with the crown prince, according to someone familiar with the situation, he has been able to apply some pressure when he has been asked to. Indeed, Kushner told Jones on Monday that he has urged M.B.S. to be transparent because “the world is watching.” He wouldn’t elaborate on the specifics of his advice to Trump, though there have been reports over the last week that he told his father-in-law to wait before jumping to conclusions about what happened to Khashoggi.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;At the end of it all, those around Kushner felt like it was a success. He had managed to tout some of his accomplishments while towing the administration’s line on Khashoggi. Afterward, Kushner left the Time Warner Center and headed to more comfortable ground outside the glare of news camera. He sat down with News Corp executive chairman and longtime friend &lt;strong&gt;Rupert Murdoch,&lt;/strong&gt; according to the person familiar with the situation, before taking a flight back to Washington. Later that evening, Ivanka posted a link to the Van Jones interview for her 5.8 million Twitter followers to watch. “I am continuously impressed by his incredible work ethic, laser focus, and quiet achievement as he serves our great country,” she wrote.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;More Great Stories from &lt;em&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212; Uber wants to be the next Amazon; but it &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/uber-the-next-amazon-but-others-see-the-next-yahoo?inline\"&gt;could end up the next Yahoo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212; Meet the fake Saudi prince with a &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2018/10/he-actually-believes-he-is-khalid-the-odyssey-of-a-counterfeit-saudi-prince?inline\"&gt;30-year plan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212; We talked to the most &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/inside-yamam-top-secret-israeli-anti-terrorism-operation?inline\"&gt;elite counterterrorism unit in the world&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212; Why Michael Bloomberg’s cash bombs might &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/michael-bloomberg-funds-democrats-in-2018?inline\"&gt;not actually help him be president&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212; &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/where-is-barack-obama-2018-midterms?inline\"&gt;Where is Obama?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Looking for more? &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/newsletters\"&gt;Sign up&lt;/a&gt; for our daily Hive newsletter and never miss a story.&lt;/p&gt;","rubric":"The First Family","socialTitle":"In Kushnerworld, His Cable-News Debut Was a Win","socialDescription":"People in Kushner’s orbit wondered whether he would withdraw from the CNN event.

His SpringHill\nproduction company, with offices on the Warner Bros. lot, is working on\na remake of &lt;em&gt;House Party&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/09/space-jam-lebron-james-terence-nance-ryan-coogler\"&gt;a sequel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Space Jam 2,&lt;/em&gt; starring James and\nproduced by Ryan Coogler.

But Iger’s political ambitions were suspended when he saw the\nopportunity to buy 21st Century Fox, for a cool $71 billion. An\nantidote to AT&amp;amp;T’s $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner, the move\nhelped usher Disney into a new era of streaming&amp;#8212;and open a new front\nin its battle with Netflix.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.

documentary, &lt;em&gt;Divide and Conquer.&lt;/em&gt;","body":"&lt;p&gt;In &lt;strong&gt;Alexis Bloom’s&lt;/strong&gt; new documentary &lt;em&gt;Divide and Conquer: The Story of &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/people/roger-ailes\"&gt;Roger Ailes&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; a former Fox News staffer recalls his early days at the conservative cable channel.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;“It was imparted on me right from the beginning that it was not about journalism,” explains &lt;strong&gt;Joe Muto,&lt;/strong&gt; a former associate producer of &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/04/how-will-history-remember-bill-oreilly\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The O&amp;#39;Reilly Factor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; His commentary sounds especially eerie in the Fake News era: “It was about drawing the biggest audience possible. We used to call it ‘riling up the crazies.’ That’s what we were there to do. We were there to stir up outrage.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Divide and Conquer&lt;/em&gt;, which premiered at the Toronto Film Festival this week, is part character study of Ailes, the political consultant and media mastermind who founded &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/06/fox-news-pleading-for-mercy-in-donald-trumps-court\"&gt;Fox News&lt;/a&gt; in 1996, and part post-mortem of Trump’s election. The two went hand in hand; explains Muto, “Trump is such a Fox-y character that if he wasn’t real, Roger Ailes would have created him in a lab.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Bloom, who previously co-directed &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/01/bright-lights-documentary-carrie-fisher-debbie-reynolds-emotional-moments\"&gt;Bright Lights: Starring Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds,&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; initially intended to make a documentary about &lt;strong&gt;Rupert Murdoch,&lt;/strong&gt; the News Corp media mogul who hired Ailes. But Bloom ran into issues of access. And besides, Bloom told &lt;em&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/em&gt; this week, “He’s tough to watch. Murdoch’s had such an enormous influence on our lives, on our media landscape. But he’s this organism that’s perfectly designed to make money. And that’s the only thing that animates him. Doesn’t make a terribly good subject for a documentary.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Ailes, who died last year, was a bit more charismatic. He spent some of his early career on-camera and, in one of his more light-hearted trivia notes, at one point tap-danced as a means to maintain a slim physique. Ailes also had a more intriguing backstory than Murdoch: born in Ohio, Ailes was diagnosed with hemophilia as a child and lived in fear of the medical condition. Though he could not cure the disorder, he found a way to inflict fear in others.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Asked how much sympathy she has for film subjects like Ailes&amp;#8212;a man accused of stoking outrage, serial sexual harassment, and extinguishing the careers of women who resisted him&amp;#8212;Bloom was careful not to cast men like him as black-and-white villains. “It’s too convenient to make them a monster, or sort of shovel them into a paradigm,” said Bloom. “We’re all in this together. We’re all human. I grew up in apartheid South Africa where there was sort of extraordinary evil in very ordinary guises. People who enforced apartheid on a daily level, from not letting black Africans into the tennis club or onto the beach&amp;#8212;not all of those people were evil, although their acts were certainly despicable. I fundamentally connect with all people as human. And if you’re going to do a film like one about Roger, you have to know that he’s ordinary and human in some way.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"embed cneembed\"&gt;&lt;div class=\"embed block cneembed\" data-url=\"//player.cnevids.com/script/video/591dcd1bb57ac34325000011.js?muted=1\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ailes certainly had his hangups: he spun lies and created a false mythology for himself. (He incorrectly claimed, for example, that he invented the split-screen effect). His relationship with his mother had not been very physical&amp;#8212;in an interview, Ailes confessed this could have been because his mother felt responsible for his hemophilia. Ailes was also wildly paranoid, so much so that he carried a gun at all times, installed a steel door to guard his office, and outfitted his personal and professional lairs with cameras.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Ailes began his career working up the production ladder on &lt;em&gt;The Mike Douglas Show&lt;/em&gt; before pivoting to politics. As a consultant to Nixon during the 1968 presidential campaign, Ailes helped repair Nixon’s image after his disastrous first debate with John F. Kennedy. Years later, he would exercise his eye for optics in less savory ways&amp;#8212;at &lt;em&gt;America’s Talking&lt;/em&gt;, the channel he ran before Fox News, Ailes encouraged the female anchors to wear short skirts and sit at translucent desks where their legs were backlit. Explains one staffer in the film, “Roger always knew the lowest common denominator in people&amp;#8212;he knew how to strike at that.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Bloom had to carefully navigate her interviews with women who say they were sexually harassed by Ailes. Some accusers did not feel comfortable sharing their stories. Others had accepted settlements, preventing them from speaking to the filmmaker. Bloom ended up interviewing former Republican National Committee field adviser &lt;strong&gt;Kellie Boyle&lt;/strong&gt;, former WNYW correspondent &lt;strong&gt;Lidia Curanaj&lt;/strong&gt;, and former model &lt;strong&gt;Marsha Callahan,&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#8212;all three of whom say they were punished, in one way or another, for resisting advances from Ailes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It was not until 2016, two decades after founding Fox News, that his behavior caught up to him. Former &lt;em&gt;Fox and Friends&lt;/em&gt; co-host &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/08/nicole-kidman-gretchen-carlson-roger-ailes-movie-margot-robbie\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gretchen Carlson&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; filed a sexual-harassment lawsuit against Ailes that inspired dozens more accusers to come forward. (&lt;em&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/em&gt; contributor &lt;strong&gt;Sarah Ellison&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/09/roger-ailes-fox-news-final-days\"&gt;reminds us in the film&lt;/a&gt; that it was Donald Trump who helped Ailes find a crisis-management team.) His hand forced by the Murdochs, Ailes resigned from Fox News with a letter that did not &lt;a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-twenty-first-fox-ailes/fox-news-chief-ailes-resigns-after-sexual-harassment-claims-idUSKCN1012SU\"&gt;indicate he had done anything wrong&lt;/a&gt;. The following year, before taking responsibility for his alleged actions, Ailes &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/05/roger-ailes-death-fox-news\"&gt;died&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Asked what she wants audiences to take from the film, Bloom said, “I just hope the film gives a deeper understanding of the current moment in America. The monetization of fear, and the weaponization of fear, and how a channel like Fox News is really making money off stoking people’s fears.” Ailes may be dead, but his legacy&amp;#8212;Fox News&amp;#8212;remains. And his impact on politics, Bloom pointed out, “continues post-Roger.”&lt;/p&gt;","rubric":"TORONTO FILM FESTIVAL","socialTitle":"Deconstructing Roger Ailes, the Man Who Built Fox News From Fear and

Ten months later, in September 2017, he fled to Washington. “I began to feel whatever narrow space I had in Saudi Arabia was getting narrower. I thought it would be better to get out and be safe,” he told me.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I initially contacted Khashoggi for a prospective article about the young prince’s relationship to the White House, which I shelved because he was one of the few people who would speak openly. When he left Saudi Arabia, Khashoggi told me, he didn’t see himself in the mold of a dissident. He’d been editor-in-chief of the Saudi newspaper &lt;em&gt;Al Watan&lt;/em&gt; and a media adviser to Prince &lt;strong&gt;Turki al-Faisal,&lt;/strong&gt; Saudi Arabia’s ambassador to Britain. Moreover, he wanted M.B.S. to succeed. “He truly wants to make Saudi Arabia great again. But he is doing it the wrong way,”  Khashoggi told me.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But a month after his departure from the kingdom, Khashoggi’s view of M.B.S. fundamentally changed. Saudi security services arrested scores of prominent businessmen and imprisoned them inside the Ritz-Carlton under the guise of an “anti-corruption” crackdown. Khashoggi soon began hearing from friends in Saudi Arabia that prisoners were coerced, in some cases tortured, into turning over billions of dollars to the government. “It was tough. Some were insulted. Some were hit. Some claim they were electrocuted,” he said. The purge, which also included intellectuals, media personalities, and moderate clerics, convinced Khashoggi that M.B.S. had sold himself as a reformer when in fact he was a brutal authoritarian. “When the arrests started happening, I flipped. I decided it was time to speak,” he told me.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Khashoggi subsequently landed a column in &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; where he wrote critically about M.B.S.’s internal power grab; his reckless military intervention in neighboring Yemen, where he has created a humanitarian emergency; and the prince’s bizarre plot to kidnap Lebanese prime minister &lt;strong&gt;Saad Hariri.&lt;/strong&gt; “Saudi Arabia wasn’t a free society, but people weren’t being arrested like this,” he said. “The people M.B.S. arrested were not radicals. The majority were reformers for women’s rights and open society. He arrested them to spread fear. He is replacing religious intolerance with political closure.” An adviser to one prominent Saudi businessman who was arrested told me: “People are scared. It has become a bit of a police state.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Tragically, Khashoggi’s self-imposed exile didn’t keep him safe. Earlier this month, Khashoggi entered Saudi Arabia’s consulate in Istanbul to obtain documents he needed for his upcoming wedding and never emerged. Turkish officials have told Western journalists that a kill team of 15 Saudi agents detained Khashoggi inside the consulate, tortured him to death, and dismembered his body with a bone saw. M.B.S. and his father, &lt;strong&gt;King Salman,&lt;/strong&gt; have denied their involvement in Khashoggi’s disappearance, but already the grisly episode has damaged M.B.S.’s ambitions to cultivate global elites. A parade of C.E.O.s including Uber’s &lt;strong&gt;Dara Khosrowshahi,&lt;/strong&gt; JPMorgan Chase’s &lt;strong&gt;Jamie Dimon,&lt;/strong&gt; and BlackRock’s &lt;strong&gt;Larry Fink&lt;/strong&gt; have canceled plans to attend an investment conference hosted by M.B.S. next week at the Riyadh Ritz-Carlton dubbed “Davos in the Desert,” though Fink, at least, has said he’ll maintain his business ties to the kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Khashoggi and I spoke last March during M.B.S.’s three-week tour of the United States that was designed to cement M.B.S.’s image on the global stage as an avatar of a modern Middle East. In the &lt;em&gt;Times,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Tom Friedman&lt;/strong&gt; wrote a column gushing that M.B.S. possessed a “fire hose of new ideas about transforming his country . . . who talks the language of tech, and whose biggest sin may be that he wants to go too fast.” One media C.E.O. who met with the prince on his visit praised the prince’s plans to allow women to drive and movie theaters to open. M.B.S. was feted by the Trump administration, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/04/prince-mohammed-does-hollywood\"&gt;Rupert Murdoch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/04/prince-mohammed-does-hollywood\"&gt;Jeff Bezos&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; and even &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/06/world/middleeast/saudi-prince-mohammed-bin-salman-us.html\"&gt;Oprah&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The elite’s embrace of M.B.S. had been one of the chief foreign-policy goals of the Trump White House, particularly &lt;strong&gt;Jared Kushner.&lt;/strong&gt; Saudi Arabia was crucial to Kushner’s yet-to-be-released Middle East peace plan that involved building a Sunni-Israeli alliance to broker peace with the Palestinians and counter an expansionist Iran. “Jared had a vision from the very beginning,” a former West Wing official said. Kushner’s support for M.B.S. at times bordered on blind faith. In November 2017, the &lt;em&gt;Post&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/global-opinions/the-saudi-crown-princes-risky-power-play/2017/11/05/4b12fcf0-c272-11e7-afe9-4f60b5a6c4a0_story.html?utm_term=.ace9d3ac8edd\"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that Kushner made an unannounced trip to Riyadh just days before the Ritz arrests began and stayed up several nights discussing strategy with M.B.S. ’til 4 A.M. (The White House declined to comment.)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Kushner’s bromance with M.B.S. generated criticism from Trump’s national security team, especially former Secretary of State &lt;strong&gt;Rex Tillerson.&lt;/strong&gt; “Tillerson said, ‘The kid’s a rookie, he doesn’t know the region.’ He was beyond dismissive,” a former West Wing official said. Another former West Wing official recalled: “There were many confrontations between Tillerson and Jared where Tillerson was emotionally angry that Jared was in contact with M.B.S. I remember in a couple of instances, Tillerson would confront Jared about directly talking to M.B.S. Rex felt out of loop.” (Tillerson did not respond to a request for comment.)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Diplomats who served in the region also question Kushner’s logic of investing so much in an untested and impulsive young royal. “I’ve taken to calling M.B.S. a progressive authoritarian. He’s using this anti-corruption push toward cleaning up but also removing rivals,” said &lt;strong&gt;Robert Jordan,&lt;/strong&gt; who served as &lt;strong&gt;George W. Bush’s&lt;/strong&gt; ambassador to Saudi Arabia after 9/11.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, Secretary of State &lt;strong&gt;Mike Pompeo&lt;/strong&gt; flew to Riyadh to diffuse the global crisis over Khashoggi’s death&amp;#8212;a State Department spokesperson said in a statement that he “conveyed the importance of conducting a thorough, transparent, and timely investigation” in meetings with both M.B.S. and King Salman. As of now, Treasury Secretary &lt;strong&gt;Steven Mnuchin&lt;/strong&gt; still plans to attend the conference at the Ritz.&lt;/p&gt;","rubric":"Jamal Khashoggi","socialTitle":"“I Was Ordered Silent”: How Jamal Khashoggi Fell Out with bin Salman","socialDescription":"An interview conducted shortly after the Riyadh Ritz-Carlton imprisonments sheds new light on the Saudi “progressive authoritarian”—and Trump and Kushner’s infatuation with him.","seoTitle":"“I Was Ordered Silent”: How Jamal Khashoggi Fell Out with bin Salman","seoDescription":"An interview conducted shortly after the Riyadh Ritz-Carlton imprisonments sheds new light on the Saudi “progressive authoritarian”—and Trump and Kushner’s infatuation with him.","channel":"News","subChannel":"Politics","issueDate":"","ledeCaption":"","contentSource":"web","canonicalUrl":"","contentType":"","textMimeType":"","tags":["saudi arabia","Jamal Khashoggi","Paywall Exclude"],"revisionAuthor":"Alyssa Karas","meta":{"collectionName":"articles","modelName":"article","publishable":true,"identifiable":true,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":true,"hierarchical":false},"interactiveOverride":"","id":"5bc64bc23b91752db000f31b","revision":40,"createdAt":"October 16, 2018 4:36 pm","modifiedAt":"October 17, 2018 12:20 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"October 17, 2018 12:20 pm","_embedded":{"categories-channels":[{"fields":{"name":"News","slug":"news","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5ae9f11fc994fd6b2518e1a7","revision":0,"createdAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modifiedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}},{"fields":{"name":"Politics","slug":"politics","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5ae9f120dc5a49785309c3b5","revision":0,"createdAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modifiedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}}],"categories-functional-tags":[{"fields":{"name":"Paywall Exclude","slug":"paywall-exclude","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5b4cb83d6c0055288786da66","revision":2,"createdAt":"July 16, 2018 11:22 am","modifiedAt":"August 3, 2018 11:54 am","revisionCreatedAt":"August 3, 2018 11:54 am","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}}],"categories-tags":[{"fields":{"name":"saudi arabia","slug":"saudi-arabia","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5b4cb85332b3790c82c9b5d8","revision":0,"createdAt":"July 16, 2018 11:22 am","modifiedAt":"July 16, 2018 11:22 am","revisionCreatedAt":"July 16, 2018 11:22 am","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}},{"fields":{"name":"Jamal Khashoggi","slug":"jamal-khashoggi","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5bc64c1225c2f22d7bcb9b8a","revision":0,"createdAt":"October 16, 2018 4:37 pm","modifiedAt":"October 16, 2018 4:37 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"October 16, 2018 4:37 pm","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}}],"contributorsAuthor":[{"fields":{"revisionAuthor":"Jarondakie Patrick","name":"Gabriel Sherman","bio":"Gabriel Sherman is a special correspondent for &lt;em&gt;Vanity Fair.&lt;/em&gt; Most recently, Sherman served as national-affairs editor at &lt;em&gt;New York&lt;/em&gt; magazine, and he is a regular contributor to NBC News and MSNBC.

Certainly not the Barrymores, though Drew survives, even flourishes, after the fire starter of her childhood. Perhaps not the Baldwins, Fondas, or Carradines, and definitely not the fictional Tyrones of Eugene O’Neill’s &lt;em&gt;Long Day’s Journey into Night&lt;/em&gt;. The Culkins, however, now well into their 20s and 30s, are another story, perhaps most reminiscent not of a dynastic Hollywood brood but of a fictional literary one: J. D. Salinger’s Glass family.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Seven children, raised as performers, are each uniquely talented and yet reluctant to be famous, brutally aware of the trappings of celebrity and determined to find a peaceful path forward. Like the Glass children, the original Culkin seven&amp;#8212;Christian, Dakota, Macaulay, Kieran, Rory, Shane, and Quinn&amp;#8212;constitute a group of highly individualistic, sensitive, and creative people who have gone into and out of the public eye. And, more recently, out from under the shadow cast by the family’s most famous offspring: Macaulay Culkin, the hugely popular star of &lt;em&gt;Home Alone&lt;/em&gt; (and the first child actor to be paid $1 million, for his role in &lt;em&gt;My Girl,&lt;/em&gt; as well as the second-youngest celebrity to host &lt;em&gt;Saturday Night Live&lt;/em&gt;, at age 11&amp;#8212;Drew Barrymore hosted at age 7). For now, all attention is turning to 36-year-old Kieran&amp;#8212;two years younger than Macaulay (called “Mac” by his siblings)&amp;#8212;stemming from his galvanizing performances in &lt;em&gt;Igby Goes Down&lt;/em&gt;, onstage in &lt;em&gt;This Is Our Youth&lt;/em&gt;, and now as Roman Roy in &lt;em&gt;Succession&lt;/em&gt;, this year’s surprising summer hit, on HBO. Right behind him is Rory, his immensely talented brother, now 29.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"embed block row iframe\"&gt;&lt;div class=\"wrapper\"&gt;&lt;div class=\"embed iframe-embed-component \" data-type=\"iframe\" data-url=\"https://audm.herokuapp.com/player-embed/?pub=vf&amp;amp;articleID=comeback-kid\"&gt;&lt;iframe height=\"100\" width=\"350\" src=\"https://audm.herokuapp.com/player-embed/?pub=vf&amp;amp;articleID=comeback-kid\"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If family dynasties are not rare in Hollywood, what is rare is the metamorphosis of a child star into a successful adult actor. But it does happen. Kieran and Rory have grown up on film like Drew Barrymore and Elizabeth Taylor (who once said she could not remember a time in her life when she wasn’t famous). America’s sweetheart, Shirley Temple, didn’t quite make it as a grown-up star (but she did become ambassador to Ghana and to Czechoslovakia). Macaulay is no longer a child, nor is he any longer an actor (with a few exceptions here and there), but his experiences as both have proven to be essential elements in the alchemy that is the Culkin mystique. And his siblings have been paying attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"callout feature-large\" data-type=\"callout\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The Family Business&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It’s late summer. We see Kieran standing alone, looking a little lost, with his dark hair falling over his eyes, scanning the lobby of the Bowery Hotel, in New York City, for someone he’s never met. He has an unassuming manner&amp;#8212;a kind of shy bewilderment that anyone would want to be waiting for him. We meet politely, like spies. He settles into one of the worn, Moorish-looking pieces of furniture in the Bowery’s lobby, its hunting-lodge darkness belying the scorching August sun outside. He orders an old-fashioned with Laphroaig, a scotch that’s “very smoky. It’s like drinking a tree,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;He discovered the whisky while in England, where the final episode of &lt;em&gt;Succession&lt;/em&gt; was filmed. “Right after I finished the season, I went out with Jeremy and Nick,” he recalls. (Jeremy Strong plays Kendall in the series, the second son of Logan Roy, who attempts a hostile takeover of his father’s empire. Nick is Nicholas Braun, who plays Logan Roy’s gangly great-nephew, who seems to be a sheep among wolves.) Jeremy introduced him to the drink. He’s “the guy who knows all the hit restaurants and bars&amp;#8212;whatever the rich people are doing, that’s him getting into character.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As a gesture of goodwill, I hand Kieran a gift, a slender book about the soundtrack to the &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Bros.&lt;/em&gt; video game. He’s delighted. With Nintendo, “the music was insanely important,” Kieran explains. “&lt;em&gt;Castlevania!&lt;/em&gt; Just hearing the first couple of notes of that game cheers me up if I’m having a bad day.” If they weren’t sublimely gifted actors, the Culkin kids might have been world-class gamers.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Asked about how he got into the family business, Kieran answers, “Oh, I’ve been doing this for about 29 years.” Their family patriarch, Kit Culkin, had been an actor from a young age and seemed determined to have his progeny follow in his footsteps. “My parents’ friends were running a little theater, the Light Opera of Manhattan, and whenever a production needed a kid, they were like, ‘What age and what gender? We’ve got seven of them right over here,’” Kieran explains. Kieran felt that they were often used just as onstage props. His late older sister, Dakota, who died in a car accident in 2008, was not at all interested in acting, but was pushed into it until she put her foot down. All seven of the Culkin children have been in&amp;#8212;or are in&amp;#8212;the business. (Shane was in the celebrated 1988 production of &lt;em&gt;Our Town,&lt;/em&gt; with the late monologuist Spalding Gray.)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Given his early start, it’s surprising to hear Kieran say that he doesn’t have “any technical training whatsoever. I was just sort of already doing it, continued to do it, and then, Oh, shit, I have a career!” While he was ultimately cast as the feckless, outrageous Roman Roy (a borderline personality by his own admission at the end of Season One of &lt;em&gt;Succession&lt;/em&gt;), he had been originally considered for the character of 26-year-old Greg Hirsch (a.k.a. “Greg the Egg”). But Kieran felt that he was too old to play that character, and fell in love with Roman the moment he appears in the script and says, “Hey, hey, motherfucker.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Quinn, 33, is also an actor (she played Macaulay’s sister in &lt;em&gt;The Good Son&lt;/em&gt; in 1993). She recently told &lt;em&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/em&gt;, “I’ve actually had people tell me when they watch, ‘Oh, he’s not really acting. He’s just being himself.’ I’m like, ‘You don’t know him. He’s not like that,’” although she admits that, growing up, “he was always kind of known for challenging anybody in a position of authority. The character isn’t him, but it’s very similar to him. My brother definitely has more heart than that. I’ve seen him play the bully and the bullied, because I think he’s capable of being both.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Kieran felt that he didn’t need to do any research for the part. He immediately understood the Roy family dynamic: that they’re so rich and powerful they don’t have to suffer consequences. “You can be a total idiot, a fuckup&amp;#8212;doesn’t matter. Keep dropping out&amp;#8212;doesn’t matter. You can say whatever you want, do whatever you want&amp;#8212;doesn’t matter. Roman can slap his sister in the face, and that’s O.K. ‘What are you going to do? Sue me?’”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Home, Not So Alone&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For the first nine years of Kieran’s life, the Culkins lived in a railroad apartment in a tenement on East 94th Street and Second Avenue, “barely suitable for a couple,” Kieran says. “It was just a hallway, and there were no separating doors, except for the bathroom, which didn’t have a lock. They raised seven kids in that apartment&amp;#8212;for years! They just kept bringing babies home to this little space.” Not surprisingly, it was a rough-and-tumble atmosphere. “Some of us would go to school,” recalls Kieran. “Some would not. We used to watch wrestling. I remember watching Macho Man versus Brutus ‘the Barber’ Beefcake, and then me, Shane, and Mac would imitate those matches.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"callout large has-pullquote\" data-type=\"callout\"&gt;&lt;div class=\"embed pullquote\" data-type=\"pullquote\"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;“We’re quite peerless because of our experiences,” says Macaulay.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"component-social-share pullquote mono closed\" data-component=\"SocialShare\" role=\"list\"&gt;&lt;div class=\"share-item twitter\" data-component=\"twitter\" data-href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=%22%0A%E2%80%9CWe%E2%80%99re%20quite%20peerless%20because%20of%20our%20experiences%2C%E2%80%9D%20says%20Macaulay.%0A%0A%22&amp;amp;via=VanityFair&amp;amp;url=\" role=\"listitem\"&gt;&lt;a aria-label=\"Tweet\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=%22%0A%E2%80%9CWe%E2%80%99re%20quite%20peerless%20because%20of%20our%20experiences%2C%E2%80%9D%20says%20Macaulay.%0A%0A%22&amp;amp;via=VanityFair&amp;amp;url=\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"icon\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"label\"&gt;Twitter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their mother, Patricia Brentrup, held it all together. The family’s longtime agent and manager, Emily Gerson Saines, described her as someone who “has maintained strong family values, like the family having a meal together, the Christmas tree, Thanksgiving. These are all important things to Patty, and she instilled that in her kids.” According to Kieran, he still has “a great relationship” with his mother, who, after 30 years of living in New York, married a different man and moved to Billings, Montana. “She’s taught me a lot. She’s a wonderful woman.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But life with their father, Christopher Cornelius “Kit” Culkin, was not so wonderful. Kieran and Mac have no contact with him. Kit was born and raised in Manhattan&amp;#8212;the son of a public-relations man and a mother who became his manager&amp;#8212;along with his brother and sister (his sister being the actress Bonnie Bedelia, perhaps best remembered for playing drag-racer Shirley Muldowney in Jonathan Kaplan’s 1983 film &lt;em&gt;Heart Like a Wheel&lt;/em&gt;). As a young actor, Kit had an auspicious beginning, appearing in 1960 with Laurence Olivier in Jean Anouilh’s &lt;em&gt;Becket&lt;/em&gt;, and four years later on Broadway in John Gielgud’s production of &lt;em&gt;Hamlet&lt;/em&gt;, starring Richard Burton.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Though his career foundered and he worked for a while as a church sacristan, Kit found his way back into show business through Macaulay. Soon he was managing the biggest child star since Shirley Temple. Macaulay’s blockbuster film, &lt;em&gt;Home Alone&lt;/em&gt;, became, at the time, the third-highest moneymaker in the history of the movies (after &lt;em&gt;E.T. the Extraterrestrial&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; films). Its huge success even gave rise to a Hollywood phrase, to be “&lt;em&gt;Home Aloned&lt;/em&gt;,” which meant having your own movie’s box office dwarfed by another wildly popular film.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Its sequel, &lt;em&gt;Home Alone 2: Lost in New York&lt;/em&gt;, earned more than $359 million. Its success gave Kit tremendous influence in Hollywood because, if you wanted Macaulay, you had to go through Kit. In 1993, &lt;em&gt;Premiere&lt;/em&gt; magazine rated Kit Culkin the 48th most powerful person in Hollywood, ahead of Michael Douglas and Eddie Murphy, but he quickly began making enemies. Studio executives grumbled that Culkin Sr.~tried to use his power to wrest creative control of Macaulay’s movies.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;At home, according to a revealing interview with Macaulay on Marc Maron’s &lt;em&gt;WTF&lt;/em&gt; podcast, Kit was allegedly a domestic tyrant, terrorizing his children with punishing threats and humiliation. Ultimately, he alienated his children and his wife and eventually lost everything. It even affected Macaulay’s popularity; &lt;em&gt;New York&lt;/em&gt; magazine noted that his “rapid ascent seemed less adorable and precocious the more people learned about his home life.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Macaulay told Marc Maron that he felt his father was “jealous” of him, because “everything he tried to do in his life I excelled at before I was 10 years old.” Whenever he and his father left to make a movie, Macaulay found himself “locked in a [hotel] room with a man who didn’t like me,” but at least it spared the rest of his family months of their father’s cruelty. (Kit Culkin could not be reached for comment.)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Macaulay described how he walked away from acting after playing the Harvey Comics character in the 1994 movie &lt;em&gt;Richie Rich&lt;/em&gt;. He told his parents, “I’m done, guys&amp;#8212;hope you all made your money because there is no more coming from me.” Patricia (who was not married to Kit) filed for custody, igniting a bitter public battle culminating in Macaulay taking his parents to court to block them from controlling his $17 million in earnings. “I learned how to read court papers at 14,” Macaulay told &lt;em&gt;New York&lt;/em&gt; in 2006, and from then on he and his father were estranged.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It was an estrangement that went deep.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"callout feature-large\" data-type=\"callout\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kieran, too, had difficulties with his father. “He’s not a good dude, but he wasn’t really a big part of my life after the age of 15. Sometime in the 90s, he went away and disappeared for two, three weeks, and the babysitter remarked to my mom, ‘You know what’s funny is their father’s been gone for three weeks, and not one of them has said, Hey, where’s Dad?’ Nobody cared, actually. My mom was the parent, so when he wasn’t there it was nicer and better.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For Macaulay, closure didn’t come until he wrote about his father in his novel-cum-memoir, &lt;em&gt;Junior&lt;/em&gt;, published by Miramax Books in 2006 when he was just 25 years old. Harrowing open letters to his father stand out among pieces of whimsy and a few fond, early memories of Kit. (“I used to love to help him clean the organ [in church] or ring the big bells in the bell tower. And on one of those days when I had the privilege of going to work with him, I asked him if I could go to the moon.”)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;“It didn’t have to be like this,” he writes in a letter that begins, “Dear Father.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;“We could have stayed poor. . . . You showed me what it was like to be afraid. . . . You hurt people a lot, you know. I am not just talking about your family and the other important people around you; you hurt our name. I should know. Did you know I had to apologize on your behalf way too many times? . . .  You made a lot of people cry. You made my mother cry.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Macaulay grew up fast, getting married at 17 to the actress Rachel Miner, also from a theatrical family, whom he’d met at the Professional Children’s School, in New York City; but they separated two years later. Then came an eight-year relationship with the actress Mila Kunis (&lt;em&gt;That ‘70s Show, Black Swan&lt;/em&gt;), but his outsize fame proved burdensome; it was like having a third person between them. Fans still stalked him in the streets.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Being Famous&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Kieran was about eight or nine when Macaulay’s immense popularity hit the family like a tsunami. “There were times when he was just a kid walking down the street and people would start surrounding him.” Once, a cabdriver recognized Macaulay when he was heading home with his brothers. “He was being kind of creepy,” Kieran recalls. Shane had the cabdriver drop them off at the corner, but when they started walking toward home, the taxi crept along behind them. On another occasion, when Macaulay pulled a cap low over his forehead in an attempt to look anonymous, a woman walked up, grabbed the cap off his head, peered at him, and said, “Yeah, it’s him.” And then: “You’re not that cute.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It makes sense that Kieran sees fame as “not a nice thing. I think well-adjusted, smart people that experience it first- or secondhand would not pursue it,” he says. “I’ll totally take personal happiness over success, absolutely. If I’m miserable, then what’s the fucking point?”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Macaulay realized early on how much his fame isolated him. “We’re quite peerless because of our experiences,” he admitted. “We can’t really look around and find someone who’s had a similar upbringing. It’s added to our closeness.” That was a big part of his friendship with Michael Jackson. “He understood, because he grew up in a similar way,” says Macaulay. “He saw certain aspects of himself in me and our family, and he wanted a safe time and a safe place to be himself.” Both Macaulay and Kieran visited Neverland Ranch, but it was Macaulay who had to go to Neverland to feel like a normal boy.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;em&gt;Igby Goes Down&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Burr Steers’s 2002 dark comedy, &lt;em&gt;Igby Goes Down&lt;/em&gt;, became a cult classic that made other actors and directors take note of Kieran Culkin&amp;#8212;but he almost didn’t get the part. He auditioned three times for the lead role of a disaffected prep-school dropout struggling to find himself (not unlike that other famous Salinger character, Holden Caulfield). Steers, the writer-director, initially passed on the audition tapes Kieran had sent in, but he had trouble casting the lead role, so he went back to Kieran. They met at a diner where, again, Steers told him he didn’t think he was right for the part. But he changed his mind when Kieran, then 18, looked at the frazzled director and said, “You look like shit.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;“I wasn’t trying to be an asshole. I just didn’t have much of a filter then. He said he had such an urge to hit me upside my head,” but that’s when he knew Kieran was right for the part. “How many people fucking hit Igby in that movie? He gets hit by five or six characters!”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It was Steers’s first movie, “and I had everything riding on it,” he told &lt;em&gt;V.F.&lt;/em&gt; in a recent phone call, “but it had taken me almost five years to get it made.” He found that, with Kieran, “you’re not aware of how incredibly emotionally deep he is. Technically he’s so strong because he grew up in front of a camera, and then you add to that what he brings emotionally.” Nonetheless, Steers admits to having been “a complete asshole to him” on the set. “I would clamp down on canned line readings. Kids get in those rhythms from those TV shows and the face acting where they’re commenting on every line by making a face.” Sometimes in the middle of a take Steers would say, “Kieran, that was Nickelodeon. Go back.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Starring with veteran actors Susan Sarandon, Jeff Goldblum, and Bill Pullman, Kieran felt that “all of the acting classes I could have taken were in those five weeks it took to shoot &lt;em&gt;Igby&lt;/em&gt;.” Kieran feels that his grown-up acting career started with &lt;em&gt;Igby&lt;/em&gt;, and “all of that was all Burr Steers. I feel I owe him my career.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Susan Sarandon played Mimi Slocumb, the icy mother dying of breast cancer, who has her young sons euthanize her in a scene that is both comic and harrowing. It was a challenging role for Kieran. “I love him,” she told &lt;em&gt;V.F.&lt;/em&gt; “He’s very talented; he had a huge responsibility in &lt;em&gt;Igby&lt;/em&gt;, with a first-time director, but he rose to the occasion and gave a great, very difficult performance. He’s also one of the sweetest young men I’ve met.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;The MacCulkins&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Emily Gerson Saines has represented the Culkins for 24 years, much of their lives. “Kit had let go of their previous agent, and they were taking meetings at the William Morris Agency, and I was at one of those meetings,” Saines told &lt;em&gt;V.F.&lt;/em&gt; “At that time, Macaulay was quite famous; it was probably 1995. Kit said, ‘If you represent Macaulay, you represent the whole family.’ I was like, O.K., I’m down with that, and I signed them.” But, after signing, Macaulay immediately made it clear that he no longer wanted to act. “He just wanted to be a kid, to have friends and hide from the spotlight.” So Saines turned her attention to Kieran, then 12, and Rory, 6, but there came a period “when Kieran was not particularly into it either. Neither Macaulay nor Kieran &lt;em&gt;chose&lt;/em&gt; to act. It was, to a large degree, chosen for them. For Rory, on the other hand, it was always his choice.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Saines saw that “there was the added complication” that Kieran was touted as Macaulay Culkin’s brother. “I don’t care whose brother he is. There’s this public perception of them that they’re one person&amp;#8212;or Macaulay’s brothers.” Their sister Quinn perhaps put it best when she told &lt;em&gt;V.F.&lt;/em&gt;, “I’ve even been called ‘MacCulkin,’ like I’m a collection of Culkins. As much as we may look alike, we’re all very different. Mac has his way that he carries himself, and Kieran, and Rory. You see it even in the way they stand. It’s very telling of who they are individually.” Perhaps that best explains the brothers’ reluctance to be photographed together for this story, preferring to be seen as persons in their own right&amp;#8212;unique, even if uniquely Culkin.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"callout large has-pullquote\" data-type=\"callout\"&gt;&lt;div class=\"embed pullquote\" data-type=\"pullquote\"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;“I’ll take happiness over success,” says Kieran. “If I’m miserable,\nwhat’s the fucking point?”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"component-social-share pullquote mono closed\" data-component=\"SocialShare\" role=\"list\"&gt;&lt;div class=\"share-item twitter\" data-component=\"twitter\" data-href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=%22%0A%E2%80%9CI%E2%80%99ll%20take%20happiness%20over%20success%2C%E2%80%9D%20says%20Kieran.%20%E2%80%9CIf%20I%E2%80%99m%20miserable%2C%0Awhat%E2%80%99s%20the%20fucking%20point%3F%E2%80%9D%0A%0A%22&amp;amp;via=VanityFair&amp;amp;url=\" role=\"listitem\"&gt;&lt;a aria-label=\"Tweet\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=%22%0A%E2%80%9CI%E2%80%99ll%20take%20happiness%20over%20success%2C%E2%80%9D%20says%20Kieran.%20%E2%80%9CIf%20I%E2%80%99m%20miserable%2C%0Awhat%E2%80%99s%20the%20fucking%20point%3F%E2%80%9D%0A%0A%22&amp;amp;via=VanityFair&amp;amp;url=\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"icon\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"label\"&gt;Twitter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;With &lt;em&gt;Igby Goes Down&lt;/em&gt;, all of a sudden attention focused on Kieran, especially after his nomination for a Golden Globe and winning a Critics Choice Award. “But he really had an aversion to all the press attention,” recalls Saines. “He used to say to me, ‘Can’t I do this and not be a celebrity?’ But it’s hard to not be a star when you’re being nominated for awards and your movies are critically acclaimed.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;em&gt;This Is Our Youth&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Kieran called Saines in 2016 after a two-year hiatus to say, “You know, I think I want to act again. I want to do &lt;em&gt;This Is Our Youth&lt;/em&gt;.” Written by Kenneth Lonergan, who would win a best-original-screenwriting Oscar in 2016 for &lt;em&gt;Manchester by the Sea&lt;/em&gt;, the play has become a perennial showcase for young actors (such as Matt Damon, Jake Gyllenhaal, Casey Affleck, Anna Paquin, Summer Phoenix, and Mark Ruffalo). It’s a three-character play about young, privileged New Yorkers desperately trying to grow up: a forlorn Warren Straub, who has stolen $15,000 from his abusive father; the more confident and worldly Dennis Ziegler, who spends the ill-gotten gains on cocaine; and Jessica Goldman, a high-strung fashion student whom Warren tries to woo.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;“I did that show back in 2002 in London’s West End playing Warren,” Kieran recalls. A decade later, Kieran was instrumental in reviving the play in Australia, followed by a successful run in 2014 at New York’s Cort Theater, where he played Dennis opposite Michael Cera and Tavi Gevinson. For Kieran, &lt;em&gt;This Is Our Youth&lt;/em&gt; was his “dream job.” He loved the play; he loved the language; and he loved all the roles&amp;#8212;”part of me wanted to play fucking Jessica. I felt that was such a great part.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"callout feature-large\" data-type=\"callout\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jessica was played by Gevinson, the precocious writer and fashion blogger turned editor and actress. “I loved working with Kieran,” she told &lt;em&gt;V.F.&lt;/em&gt; “Between him and Michael [Cera], I laughed more in those eight months than I have in my whole life. I had a chip on my shoulder going in, because I’m not trained, and it was my first professional theater production, and there’s much ado about Broadway. I don’t know how an actor’s supposed to prepare. It helped me to be around Kieran, who’s basically a mechanic: ‘This is a task. This is my job. This is the only thing I know how to do, because I have no other skills, and I didn’t go to college . . . ‘“&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;They socialized a lot, going to the Culkins’ Christmas and New Year’s Eve parties, and in Chicago they had “a Nintendo 64 in the dressing room, and then we upgraded to a Wii once we moved to Broadway,” said Gevinson. She sometimes played a kind of three-dimensional charades with Kieran and his wife, Jazz, “where you would combine clues. You’d somehow find a way to act out ‘Woody Allen Ginsberg,’ and sometimes it would be five clues long.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Lonergan, a big fan of &lt;em&gt;Succession&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8212;and not just because his wife, J. Smith-Cameron, plays the family &lt;em&gt;consigliere&lt;/em&gt;, Gerri Killman&amp;#8212;understands Kieran’s not wanting to deal with the level of public adoration that Macaulay endured. He saw how Macaulay was “widely attacked, because like all child stars, everyone raved about him, and then two years later he became the poster boy for what’s wrong with child stars. They did the exact same thing to Haley Joel Osment&amp;#8212;the kid who was in &lt;em&gt;The Sixth Sense&lt;/em&gt;. It’s two years of ‘What a genius,’ and then five years later they’re like, ‘At least they didn’t cast Haley Joel Osment.’ Or ‘Thank God it wasn’t Macaulay Culkin.’ All the actors did was take more jobs, and then they did something terrible&amp;#8212;they grew up.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Rory&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Lonergan’s arc as a successful playwright and screenwriter has been entwined with two of the Culkin brothers. Lonergan first met Rory, then nine, at an audition for &lt;em&gt;You Can Count on Me&lt;/em&gt;, in 1999. “We saw a bunch of little boys” for the role of Rudy, the son of Laura Linney’s character, who is raising him alone in a small town until her unreliable brother, played by Mark Ruffalo, shows up. “Rory came in,” Lonergan recalls, “and he was actually carsick from the ride to the audition, and he was very quiet, very real, and just immediately engaging. He was right on the money for the part. I don’t know why, because he barely said anything.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;That same year, Rory memorably played the younger brother of Joaquin Phoenix’s character in M. Night Shyamalan’s &lt;em&gt;Signs&lt;/em&gt;, and two years after starring in &lt;em&gt;You Can Count on Me&lt;/em&gt;, Rory appeared briefly in Steers’s &lt;em&gt;Igby Goes Down&lt;/em&gt;, playing Kieran’s character Igby’s younger self. (He also played a younger version of Macaulay’s character in &lt;em&gt;Richie Rich&lt;/em&gt;.) Though he’s nearly silent in his scenes in &lt;em&gt;Igby&lt;/em&gt;, Rory’s portrayal is heartbreaking, especially when he watches his father (played by Bill Pullman) have a spectacular breakdown in the shower. It’s a key to Igby’s grown-up disaffection, and Rory conveys that flawlessly.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Rory loves acting&amp;#8212;Kieran thinks he’s an extremely talented actor&amp;#8212;but he’s wary of being turned into a product, a “MacCulkin.” However, he is in danger of becoming a movie star when his next film, &lt;em&gt;Lords of Chaos&lt;/em&gt;, is released early next year. Based on the book &lt;em&gt;Lords of Chaos: The Bloody Rise of the Satanic Metal Underground&lt;/em&gt;, by Michael Moynihan and Didrik Søderlind, it’s an account of the Norwegian black-metal scene in 1993. “I’m really proud of it,” he told &lt;em&gt;V.F.&lt;/em&gt; “It’s rare when I get behind something and feel prideful of it and want to show it to people, and this is one of those. It’s sort of my baby right now.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Macaulay&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;“I’ve been &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt; my whole life,” Macaulay told &lt;em&gt;V.F.,&lt;/em&gt; shortly after returning from a trip to Germany. “I knew my life was unique, but it wasn’t until I got older that I really understood exactly how unique it was. We were just another family on the block, and then, all of a sudden, there was a sea change in the way that even the neighborhood kids would treat us. So we were always really protective of each other.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Does Macaulay miss acting? Not really. “When I was doing &lt;em&gt;My Girl&lt;/em&gt;,” he recalls, “they released a couple of hundred bees onto me, actual live bees. I knew that this was not something that every kid was doing. At the same time, it was just another day at the office. I’m pursuing other kinds of things&amp;#8212;I’m painting and I’m doing a comedy Web site. I’m writing. I’ve been described by a good friend of mine as ‘a man of leisure.’ I’m essentially a thirtysomething retired person. For me, I feel a certain level of comfort and peace.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;His passions reflect an antic sense of humor, including his band, the Pizza Underground, a parody of the Velvet Underground that reworks Velvet’s songs to make them about pizza (one of his favorite foods). “We recorded [the songs] on my dining-room table, and then forgot about it.” One of the band members put them on Bandcamp, and “the next thing you know, I’m touring in an underground pizza cover band for a year and a half.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Then there’s his comedy podcast and blog, &lt;em&gt;Bunny Ears&lt;/em&gt;, which he created with his friend Matt Cohen. Launched while Macaulay was living in Paris, it’s a satiric, Dada-like response to lifestyle blogs like Goop, reflecting his sense of absurdity and fun, “from the mind of a world-famous celebrity turned world-famous recluse.” Some of the posts: “How to break the mindset that you can do anything you set your mind to”; “How to win the social media ‘most wounded person award’”; “Décor so minimal you’ll wonder if you even exist”; “Sorry, haters: I can call my dog ‘My Baby’ because I gave birth to him”; and “Exclusive: Macaulay Culkin interviews the swarm of bees from &lt;em&gt;My Girl&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;The Culkins vs. the World&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The director Edgar Wright (&lt;em&gt;Baby Driver&lt;/em&gt;) was impressed by Kieran’s “amazing comic timing” when he read for the supporting role of Wallace Wells, a gay character in Wright’s film &lt;em&gt;Scott Pilgrim vs. the World&lt;/em&gt;. But just after he was offered the role, something terrible happened. On December 9, 2008, Kieran’s older sister, Dakota, then 29, was fatally struck by a car outside Brennan’s, an Irish bar on Lincoln Boulevard in Marina del Rey, California.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;“We didn’t want to bother him,” recalls Wright. “When someone is in such terrible grief, you can’t leave voice mails. We left him alone for a long time.” Kieran passed on the role, and Wright had to look for a replacement. But one night at a cast dinner in Toronto, the director overheard actress Alison Pill mention that she had just spoken to Kieran, who regretted giving up the role. Wright says he ran out of the restaurant and called Kieran, who told him, “ ‘Yeah, I wanna do it, but I have to tell you something. I’ve dyed my hair green and I’ve put on quite a lot of weight ‘cause I’ve been drinking a lot.’ He came up and worked out with the cast every morning, and he was an absolute pleasure,” Wright says. “The audience loved that character.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;em&gt;Succession&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Toward the end of Season One of &lt;em&gt;Succession&lt;/em&gt;, embattled media titan Logan Roy (played by the veteran Scottish actor Brian Cox) raises his glass to toast his only daughter at her wedding. The family patriarch has actually crashed the event, having been disinvited by his daughter Siobhan “Shiv” Roy (Australian actress Sarah Snook), but he manages to control his Lear-like fury toward his mutinous children, declaring, “Here’s to family, the only thing that counts.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Succession&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8212;like success&amp;#8212;has many fathers (and one mother), including creator and show-runner Jesse Armstrong and executive producers Ilene S. Landress, Kevin Messick, Will Ferrell, Adam McKay, and &lt;em&gt;New York&lt;/em&gt; columnist Frank Rich. According to Armstrong, Rupert Murdoch and his sprawling media empire initially inspired him to write the series. The familial battle for control in the Sumner Redstone dynasty also influenced him, but, as Rich noticed, once they started shooting the pilot, “suddenly we’re thinking, God, these boys are a little bit like the Trump boys. It wasn’t something that had been planned.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;When it came time to cast Roman Roy, as soon as Kieran read on camera for the part, “that was it,” recalls Armstrong. “That’s Roman. Done. He just had an instant feel for the part. In the pilot, there’s an early scene where they’re discussing changes to a trust, and Roman is lying the wrong way up on a couch. That physical gesture is one of those instinctive things which speaks volumes about his relationship to this family. He had a sense of his character from the beginning.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Alan Ruck, who had his own youthful success as Cameron Frye in &lt;em&gt;Ferris Bueller’s Day Off&lt;/em&gt;, in 1986, plays Connor, the eldest and most removed of the Roy clan. He also cites Kieran’s being “upside down on the chaise longue” as a character revelation. At that moment, Ruck thought, O.K., I know who you are. He describes Roman as “the most sociopathic of all of us&amp;#8212;I mean, we’re all terrible. But because Kieran has so much charm, you laugh at the terrible things that come out of his mouth.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"callout feature-large\" data-type=\"callout\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Snook agrees, saying that “one of the reasons Roman can get away with saying or doing just about anything is because of his wit. And Kieran is possessed of a terrific wit in his own right.” Her character has “a unique relationship with all her brothers, but with Roman, they’re truly close. There’s a real family feeling there. Though they fight, they would probably do anything for each other. But, of course, we don’t know what the second season will hold.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To Brian Cox, who plays patriarch Logan Roy with cunning, cruelty, and charisma, working with Kieran was “an absolute, constant delight. I’ve never known a young actor with such a sense of immediacy. Child actors are often maligned, but the thing about them is they just do the job. I’ve always found that there’s an exceptional professionalism about them, because they learn at an early age&amp;#8212;it kind of comes with their mother’s milk. There’s no angst. It’s unusual in American actors to have that sense of lightness. British actors have it a lot, but to find it in somebody like Kieran is very, very unusual.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Cox’s favorite scene unfolds near the end of the season when the bickering between Roman and Shiv erupts into a fistfight that has them rolling on the floor, punching and pulling hair like 10-year-olds. Sarah Snook told &lt;em&gt;V.F.&lt;/em&gt; that, although “the fight scene was blocked so we’d be safe,” they really got into it. “I think I even lost a hank of hair! I forgot that Kieran, because he’s such a fan of World Wrestling&amp;#8212;he knew all these moves.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Brian Cox would like to see Kieran do more stage work: “There are lots of things that I’d love to see him in. For example, I’d love to see him play the young Mozart in &lt;em&gt;Amadeus&lt;/em&gt;. I think he’d be extraordinary . . .  As long as I could play Salieri!”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;The Culkin-Family Romance&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Like many deposed tyrants, Kit Culkin lives in a kind of exile, according to a &lt;em&gt;Daily Mail&lt;/em&gt; article from 2016. Now 74, he was laid low by a debilitating stroke four years ago that left him having to relearn how to speak. He lives alone in a small house in Grant’s Pass, Oregon. His longtime companion, Jeanette Krylowski, died last year. He’s been sighted on rare occasions, sporting a long, gray patriarch’s beard and a trilby hat. The &lt;em&gt;Daily Mail&lt;/em&gt; reporter asked if he hears from his most famous son. Kit replied, “I don’t consider him a son anymore.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But the rest of the Culkins are thriving. “You know what’s really been lovely to see is the brothers,” says Emily Gerson Saines. “I think no one can understand the lives they’ve led but them. They have common experiences that are impossible to explain to people. I think none of them think or behave like actors.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For one thing, they share a passion for professional wrestling and follow WrestleMania around the country. “We all just recently went to Rory’s wedding,” Saines recalls, “and it was so incredible, because Kieran was there with his wife, and Macaulay was there with his girlfriend, and the women all get along really well. It just melts my heart to see them all together like that.” Rory’s marriage to the cinematographer Sarah Scrivener was officiated by Paul Heyman, the booming-voiced WWE announcer, “and the reason his wedding was in New Orleans was that’s where WrestleMania was at that moment. Everybody’s doing what they want to be doing, and they’re doing really great work. And they’re all happy in their personal lives. That’s as good as it gets in this world.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Grooming by Desirae Cherman; For details, go to &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/magazine/2018/11/december-2018-us-credits\"&gt;VF.com/credits&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story misspelled the surname of Kieran Culkin&amp;#39;s mother.

But as one veteran TV news executive said, “Once you’ve said blackface is O.K., you can’t work anywhere except Fox.”","body":"&lt;p&gt;Last year, on Friday, September 22, &lt;strong&gt;Al Roker, Dylan Dreyer,&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Sheinelle Jones&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.today.com/video/al-dylan-and-sheinelle-say-goodbye-to-today-s-take-and-welcome-megyn-kelly-1052625475956?v=railb&amp;amp;\"&gt;appeared&lt;/a&gt; together for what was presumably the last time as the co-anchors of the &lt;em&gt;Today&lt;/em&gt; show’s 9 A.M. slot, then known as &lt;em&gt;Today’s Take.&lt;/em&gt; Clutching Champagne glasses, they brought the entire crew onto the set for an emotional farewell toast. “The fact is, the &lt;em&gt;Today&lt;/em&gt; show is about family, and this family has been the best,” said Roker. He also introduced the newest member of the &lt;em&gt;Today&lt;/em&gt; family, &lt;strong&gt;Megyn Kelly,&lt;/strong&gt; who would be taking over the vaunted broadcast’s third hour that Monday. The outgoing hosts, who were to remain a part of the larger &lt;em&gt;Today&lt;/em&gt; roster, welcomed Kelly to the fold with all the signature hokeyness of morning television&amp;#8212;they presented her with gag gifts (an alarm clock and a bottle of Ketel One) and trotted out a horse so they could literally hand off the reins to their successor. As the whole gang yucked it up for the cameras, Roker joked, “What could possibly go wrong?”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The answer, as it turned out, was everything. Thirteen months later, Kelly is negotiating an exit from her staggering three-year NBC contract reportedly worth $69 million. She is covered in mud from her notorious blackface remarks, which ignited a scandal on Tuesday morning, and her future career prospects have been suddenly thrown into uncertainty. The episode was the culmination of a rocky tenure at NBC, which hired Kelly away from Fox News last year in one of the most talked-about talent poaches in the annals of TV news. As I &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/can-megyn-kelly-today-survive-megyn-kelly\"&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt; earlier this week, Kelly was never quite a comfortable fit within 30 Rock, and after more than a year of tepid ratings, on-air gaffes, tabloid leaks, tensions with management, and icy relations with colleagues at the Peacock, it was starkly apparent to both sides that the time had come to part ways. (Kelly vigorously apologized to both colleagues and viewers, admitting that she had not been attuned to the cultural sensitivities surrounding the history of white people dressing up as African Americans.)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now, Kelly and NBC are haggling over the terms of her departure. Sources familiar with the state of play told me that her attorney, Hollywood-based entertainment lawyer &lt;strong&gt;Bryan Freedman,&lt;/strong&gt; and NBC’s attorneys were negotiating by phone on Friday. (Freedman was initially expected to make a trip to New York.) NBC, one presumes, will end up having to pay out the remainder of Kelly’s contract.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Viewers, meanwhile, are wondering what’s next for the &lt;em&gt;Today&lt;/em&gt; show at 9 A.M. NBC confirmed publicly on Friday that &lt;em&gt;Megyn Kelly Today&lt;/em&gt; had been canceled and that the 9 A.M. hour on Monday would be hosted by other &lt;em&gt;Today&lt;/em&gt; anchors, whom it didn’t name. Someone familiar with the matter told me no decision has been made about a long-term plan for the hour. But 30 Rock insiders I spoke with seemed to be in agreement that the most logical thing to do would be to get the old band back together. “I think the easy play is to just go back to Al, Dylan, and Sheinelle,” one source said, noting that the network would save money both in terms of salary and studio costs, since Kelly was paid a fortune and her show was taped in front of a live audience. “Rather than doing something splashy again, it makes sense to go back to what was there.” There are, of course, other &lt;em&gt;Today&lt;/em&gt; personalities who will presumably be in the mix&amp;#8212;&lt;strong&gt;Craig Melvin,&lt;/strong&gt; for instance, or &lt;strong&gt;Jenna Bush Hager.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the route NBC decides to take, it’s safe to say &lt;em&gt;Today&lt;/em&gt; will recover from whatever damage it has incurred as a result of the Kelly disaster. Overall, the ratings are still strong, and during the show’s tentpole early-morning hours, &lt;strong&gt;Savannah Guthrie&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Hoda Kotb&lt;/strong&gt; are thriving as the main co-hosts nearly a year after the far more existential crisis of &lt;strong&gt;Matt Lauer’s&lt;/strong&gt; firing over sexual misconduct. At the same time, the incident has put the spotlight back on NBC News Chairman &lt;strong&gt;Andy Lack,&lt;/strong&gt; who had championed Kelly’s hiring in the first place, and who has recently faced scrutiny over NBC News’s handling of &lt;strong&gt;Ronan Farrow’s Harvey Weinstein&lt;/strong&gt; reporting, as well as allegations in a &lt;a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/again-and-again-accused-sexual-harassers-kept-their-jobs-under-nbc-news-chief-andy-lack\"&gt;sweeping Daily Beast report&lt;/a&gt; that Lack has a history of being soft on workplace H.R. complaints. (NBCUniversal C.E.O. &lt;strong&gt;Steve Burke&lt;/strong&gt; defended Lack, telling the Beast that Lack “has my complete support.”) In a sign that things were poised to get ugly, &lt;a href=\"https://pagesix.com/2018/10/25/megyn-kellys-lawyer-wants-ronan-farrow-on-hand-to-meet-with-nbc-execs/\"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; said Freedman had requested Farrow’s presence for the meeting with NBC management. Lack, for his part, came down hard on Kelly’s remarks during an internal town-hall meeting on Wednesday: “There is no other way to put this: I condemn those remarks; there is no place on our air or in this workplace for them.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Kelly, meanwhile, is faced with the arguably more challenging task of finding a new job. She’s without an agent&amp;#8212;having dropped CAA for UTA, which decided not to move forward with representing her&amp;#8212;and is now just working with Freedman. As one veteran TV news executive put it to me, “Once you’ve said blackface is O.K., you can’t work anywhere except Fox.” Indeed, two Fox News sources &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/megyn-kelly-eyes-returning-to-fox\"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; my colleague &lt;strong&gt;Gabriel Sherman&lt;/strong&gt; on Thursday that Kelly had recently expressed interest in returning to her old stomping grounds, where she was a breakout star of the 2016 election cycle. A source close to &lt;strong&gt;Lachlan Murdoch,&lt;/strong&gt; who runs Fox News Channel’s parent company, appeared to splash cold water on that notion, telling Sherman that Murdoch is “extremely pleased with the current lineup.” But Kelly apparently has some support at her former network. “Since she’s made an apparently heartfelt apology for grossly misguided remarks, how about showing some mercy to an otherwise good person?” &lt;strong&gt;Geraldo Rivera&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/geraldorivera/status/1055468584116326401\"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt;. “Hope she comes back to Fox.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Whatever happens, a friend of Kelly’s told me that she very much wants to stay in the game. “She’s a fighter, she’s going to fight for everything,” the friend said. “She wants to work.

the past year, morning-show hosts have gotten used to breaking disappointing, even infuriating news about their own colleagues&amp;#8212;and sometimes, the process can get emotional. On the first morning of &lt;strong&gt;Matt Lauer’s&lt;/strong&gt; absence from the &lt;em&gt;Today&lt;/em&gt; show, for instance, his co-anchor &lt;strong&gt;Savannah Guthrie&lt;/strong&gt; and future replacement &lt;strong&gt;Hoda Kotb&lt;/strong&gt; had a candid, &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/11/matt-lauer-fired-sexual-misconduct-allegations-today-show-nbc-news\"&gt;extended discussion&lt;/a&gt; about their colleague and friend, who was fired over sexual misconduct allegations. But on Friday morning, Guthrie and her &lt;em&gt;Today&lt;/em&gt; colleagues did not express a similar sorrow over &lt;strong&gt;Megyn Kelly’s&lt;/strong&gt; forecasted departure from NBC.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Today&lt;/em&gt;’s report was pointedly straightforward, without even a whiff of emotion over Kelly’s exit. Citing “source[s] familiar with the situation,” NBC News reporter &lt;strong&gt;Morgan Radford&lt;/strong&gt; told Guthrie and &lt;strong&gt;Craig Melvin&lt;/strong&gt; that talks about Kelly’s impending exit&amp;#8212;and what the network will do about her reported $69 million contract&amp;#8212;have already begun. As &lt;a href=\"https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/megyn-kelly-nbc-today-exit-talks-1202998235/\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; notes, the Friday report marks the first time that any NBC News property has made any such acknowledgement about Kelly’s departure.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"&gt;&lt;blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/TODAYshow/status/1055785428442333184\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/TODAYshow/status/1055785428442333184\"&gt;https://twitter.com/TODAYshow/status/1055785428442333184&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kelly, who hosts the &lt;em&gt;Today&lt;/em&gt; show’s 9 A.M. hour, ignited controversy on Tuesday during a discussion about Halloween costumes, when she told an all-white panel, “You do get in trouble if you are a white person who puts on blackface on Halloween, or a black person who puts on whiteface for Halloween. Back when I was a kid, that was O.K., as long as you were dressing up as, like, a character.” Kelly apologized to her &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/10/megyn-kelly-blackface-apology\"&gt;colleagues&lt;/a&gt; hours later, and to her viewers &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/10/megyn-kelly-blackface-apology-on-air-today-nbc\"&gt;on-air&lt;/a&gt; the next day. But on Thursday, news broke that &lt;em&gt;Megyn Kelly Today&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/10/megyn-kelly-today-ending-blackface-comments\"&gt;reportedly over&lt;/a&gt;, with NBC set to pay out Kelly’s contract as executives meet Friday to discuss her future at the network more broadly. (Representatives for the network did not respond to &lt;em&gt;V.F.&lt;/em&gt;’s request for comment at the time.)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Kelly’s NBC tenure has been unimpressive at best, and a total disaster at worst. She’s &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2018/01/megyn-kelly-escalates-the-jane-fonda-feud\"&gt;feuded&lt;/a&gt; with guests and generated &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/04/megyn-kelly-today-show-ratings-salary\"&gt;consistently low&lt;/a&gt; ratings&amp;#8212;despite reportedly earning twice what former 9 A.M. hosts &lt;strong&gt;Al Roker&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Tamron Hall&lt;/strong&gt; took home, combined, when they were hosting the same hour. Her blackface remarks were shocking, perhaps&amp;#8212;but not surprising, given Kelly’s documented &lt;a href=\"https://people.com/tv/megyn-kellys-most-controversial-moments-from-insisting-santa-is-white-to-defending-blackface/\"&gt;history&lt;/a&gt; of inflammatory remarks with regard to race. Though some have speculated that Kelly has been &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/megyn-kelly-eyes-returning-to-fox\"&gt;aiming&lt;/a&gt; to get back into Fox News’ good graces after flaming out at NBC, it seems that her former network home has gone on fine without her: a source close to &lt;strong&gt;Lachlan Murdoch,&lt;/strong&gt; C.E.O. of Fox News’ parent company, “New Fox,” told &lt;em&gt;V.F.&lt;/em&gt;’s &lt;strong&gt;Gabriel Sherman&lt;/strong&gt; that he is “extremely pleased with the current lineup”&amp;#8212;one that does not include Kelly.&lt;/p&gt;","rubric":"the kelly file","socialTitle":"The Today Show Doesn’t Seem Very Sorry to See Megyn Kelly Go","socialDescription":"Kelly’s NBC colleagues delivered a straightforward,

doesn’t appear to want to take her back.","body":"&lt;p&gt;Weeks before the blackface imbroglio that resulted in her being pulled off the air, &lt;strong&gt;Megyn Kelly&lt;/strong&gt; was looking for a way out of NBC. Her relationship with the peacock network had badly soured&amp;#8212;in truth, it had never been good&amp;#8212;and Kelly told friends she wanted to return to Fox News, according to two Fox News sources familiar with her thinking. “She wants to come back,” a person close to Kelly told me. Over the past month, according to two sources with knowledge of Kelly’s programming decisions, she made comments on air that would burnish her right-wing credentials for a prospective Fox homecoming. For instance, she vigorously defended &lt;strong&gt;Brett Kavanaugh&lt;/strong&gt; on multiple occasions, calling &lt;strong&gt;Dr. Christine Blasey Ford&lt;/strong&gt; a “Democrat donor” who was represented by a “well-known Democratic activist.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Would Fox take her? The answer right now appears to be no. A source close to &lt;strong&gt;Lachlan Murdoch,&lt;/strong&gt; C.E.O. of Fox News’s parent company “New Fox,” said he is “extremely pleased with the current lineup.” Two high-level Fox staffers said any final decision about Kelly would be made by Lachlan and his father, &lt;strong&gt;Rupert Murdoch&lt;/strong&gt; the company chairman.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Many factors are at play. Fox sources say the Murdochs, and Lachlan in particular, are still angry that Kelly rejected a $25 million a year offer before decamping to NBC. Among Fox anchors and producers, Kelly also remains a polarizing figure. Fox staffers resented how she leveraged her feud with &lt;strong&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/strong&gt; during the 2016 election for mainstream-media celebrity. Fox staffers also complain that she capitalized on &lt;strong&gt;Gretchen Carlson’s&lt;/strong&gt; lawsuit to position herself as a #MeToo crusader only after it was clear that Roger Ailes was going down. “There’s a lot of Schadenfreude,” one anchor said.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Another giant question is whether the Fox audience would welcome Kelly back. It’s hard to see the Murdochs making a spot for her in their pro-Trump primetime lineup, given her tangled history with the president. She could join the ranks of Fox journalists like &lt;strong&gt;Shepard Smith, Bret Baier,&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Chris Wallace,&lt;/strong&gt; but her interviews at NBC with &lt;strong&gt;Vladimir Putin&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Alex Jones&lt;/strong&gt; were widely panned. In a world where cable-news stars have defined themselves by their affinity to the president, or rejection of him, she occupies an uncomfortable role.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bryan Freedman,&lt;/strong&gt; a lawyer for Kelly, did not respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;More Great Stories from &lt;em&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212; Uber wants to be the next Amazon, but it &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/uber-the-next-amazon-but-others-see-the-next-yahoo?inline\"&gt;could end up the next Yahoo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212; Meet the fake Saudi prince with a &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2018/10/he-actually-believes-he-is-khalid-the-odyssey-of-a-counterfeit-saudi-prince?inline\"&gt;30-year plan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212; We talked to the most &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/inside-yamam-top-secret-israeli-anti-terrorism-operation?inline\"&gt;elite counterterrorism unit in the world&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212; Why Michael Bloomberg’s massive donations might &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/michael-bloomberg-funds-democrats-in-2018?inline\"&gt;not actually help him be president&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212; &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/where-is-barack-obama-2018-midterms?inline\"&gt;Where is Obama?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Looking for more? &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/newsletters\"&gt;Sign up&lt;/a&gt; for our daily Hive newsletter and never miss a story.&lt;/p&gt;","rubric":"Megyn Kelly","socialTitle":"“She Wants to Come Back”: Megyn Kelly Eyes Returning to Fox","socialDescription":"But, still burned by their breakup, Fox doesn’t appear to want to take her back.","seoTitle":"“She Wants to Come Back”: Megyn Kelly Eyes Returning to Fox","seoDescription":"But, still burned by their breakup, Fox doesn’t appear to want to take her back.","channel":"News","subChannel":"Politics","issueDate":"","ledeCaption":"Megyn Kelly, former Fox News anchor, prepares for an interview in New York, May 12, 2016.","contentSource":"web","canonicalUrl":"","contentType":"","textMimeType":"","tags":["megyn kelly"],"revisionAuthor":"Brad Beatson","meta":{"collectionName":"articles","modelName":"article","publishable":true,"identifiable":true,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":true,"hierarchical":false},"interactiveOverride":"","id":"5bd22ab1f912db43c4548cbd","revision":14,"createdAt":"October 25, 2018 4:42 pm","modifiedAt":"October 25, 2018 7:09 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"October 25, 2018 7:09 pm","_embedded":{"categories-channels":[{"fields":{"name":"News","slug":"news","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5ae9f11fc994fd6b2518e1a7","revision":0,"createdAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modifiedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}},{"fields":{"name":"Politics","slug":"politics","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5ae9f120dc5a49785309c3b5","revision":0,"createdAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modifiedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}}],"categories-tags":[{"fields":{"name":"megyn kelly","slug":"megyn-kelly","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5b4cb84e4f46c70bca18e36b","revision":0,"createdAt":"July 16, 2018 11:22 am","modifiedAt":"July 16, 2018 11:22 am","revisionCreatedAt":"July 16, 2018 11:22 am","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}}],"contributorsAuthor":[{"fields":{"revisionAuthor":"Jarondakie Patrick","name":"Gabriel Sherman","bio":"Gabriel Sherman is a special correspondent for &lt;em&gt;Vanity Fair.&lt;/em&gt; Most recently, Sherman served as national-affairs editor at &lt;em&gt;New York&lt;/em&gt; magazine, and he is a regular contributor to NBC News and MSNBC.

peace in the Middle East, and what it’s like to be part of America’s most famous power couple.","body":"&lt;p&gt;With the midterm elections on the countdown clock, CNN and the Trump administration found common cause Monday in a televised interview with &lt;strong&gt;Jared Kushner,&lt;/strong&gt; the West Wing princeling tasked with bringing order, if not peace, to the Middle East. The stakes were appropriately high for Kushner, whose reputed friendship with Saudi Crown Prince &lt;strong&gt;Mohammed bin Salman&lt;/strong&gt; recently took a &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/jared-kushner-still-convinced-grisly-bone-saw-murder-will-blow-over\"&gt;grisly turn&lt;/a&gt;. Luckily, he had an obliging interlocutor in liberal pundit &lt;strong&gt;Van Jones,&lt;/strong&gt; who has been working with Kushner on prison reform. “You have, like, the dopest job in the world, the secretary of everything,” Jones began, setting the stage for a mostly congenial conversation. “You’re a business guy, how did you wind up in this position?” Kushner, after navigating the familiar touchpoints&amp;#8212;the economy, trade, fighting for “people who felt like they didn’t have a voice”&amp;#8212;arrived at an honest answer: “The president trusts me.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;”I’ve been able to do it quietly, I’ve been able to do it effectively, I’ve been able to deliver results,” Kushner continued, his voice scraping the bottom of its most gravelly register. “I don’t make a lot of noise&amp;#8212;noise is sometimes made about me, but I try to keep my head down.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The light tone was in keeping with the venue: CITIZEN, a day-long political forum, convened by CNN, to bring together “thought leaders and newsmakers” before an invite-only audience. Featured guests included &lt;strong&gt;Michael Bloomberg, Jeff Flake, Rahm Emanuel, Kristen Soltis Anderson,&lt;/strong&gt; and other representatives of the radical center. Blood sport, in other words, was not on the menu.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;After a lengthy exchange on prison reform, Jones eventually brought the topic around to the alleged murder and dismemberment of Jamal Khashoggi&amp;#8212;or, as Jones put it, “This situation that happened.” “Do you trust the Saudis to investigate themselves?” he asked. “It seems like M.B.S.”&amp;#8212;the media’s preferred nomenclature for bin Salman&amp;#8212;“is the prime suspect.” Kushner, his body arranged in a series of rigid right angles, stuck to his prepared talking points. “We’re getting facts in from multiple places,” he replied. “Once those facts come in, the secretary of state will work with our national security team to help us determine what we want to believe and what we think is credible and what we think is not credible.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Jones attempted a follow-up. “I mean, do you see anything that seems deceptive?” he added, gently. Kushner was unmoved: “I see things that are deceptive every day. I see them in the Middle East, I see them in Washington&amp;#8212;and so, again, I think that we have our eyes wide open.” He revealed that he had advised M.B.S. “just to be transparent, to be fully transparent&amp;#8212;the world is watching.” Jones tried once more to press the subject, in what was clearly an awkward subject for both men:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Jones: So, that balance&amp;#8212;you’ve got the strategic objectives, but then you’ve got this real, I think, violation of human rights and that kind of stuff. I guess my&amp;#8212;I think the core of the core, like the people that are mad at Jared Kushner right now, is I think people feel like: We got this . . . this American prince, he’s making friends with the Saudi prince. But the Saudi prince, like, killed the dissident, and it’s your fault. Because if you hadn’t been friends with him, he wouldn’t have felt like he could get away with it. How do you respond to those kinds of critics?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Kushner: I’m not even sure where to start with that. Look, I don’t respond to the critics. I think that my job is to, every day, focus on, “What are the objectives I have to accomplish.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;With that out of the way, Kushner and Jones moved on to the other Big Issues of the day. They discussed Israel (“How are we going to get peace in the Middle East, by the way?”), trade (“You know, you guys are weird on trade”), unions (“I want people to understand that: your brain”), and so on. On the topic of making peace with the Palestinians, in particular, Kushner took the long view: “One thing that we determined very early on is that if we are going to fail, we’re not going to fail doing it the same way that people have done it before,” he explained. “Which is why we’ve taken the approach we have.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, as Jones periodically lamented, “The clock is not our friend.” And so they moved on to the lightning round.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Kushner discussed Trump as a grandfather:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;“He has a little candy drawer where he knows how to make sure they get stuff their mom won’t let them have. He really loves his family and he gets a lot of pleasure out of that.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What it’s like being married to &lt;strong&gt;Ivanka Trump:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;“Anyone with Ivanka would be a power couple. She’s really amazing. When we started dating, I told her that if I wasn’t so attracted to her she’d just be my best friend.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And the penultimate question: “You know, are you having fun?” Kushner, unblinking and unmoving, demurred. “I wouldn’t say fun . . . I’d say, more invigorated by it. I think that it’s obviously the challenge of a lifetime.”&lt;/p&gt;","rubric":"Kushner","socialTitle":"“Are You Having Fun?”: Van Jones Makes Jared Kushner Look Like a Hidden

media ignored Saudi atrocities in Yemen, so why not a missing journalist?","body":"&lt;p&gt;Last week, we learned that First Son-in-Law &lt;strong&gt;Jared Kushner&lt;/strong&gt; had &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/trumps-not-gonna-let-a-little-murder-get-in-the-way-of-his-dollar110-billion-arms-deal\"&gt;spoken&lt;/a&gt; to Crown Prince &lt;strong&gt;Mohammed bin Salman&lt;/strong&gt; regarding the speculation, fanned by both U.S. and Turkish intelligence officials, that the Saudi ruler had ordered the killing of journalist and dissident Jamal Khashoggi. At the time, we were vaguely told that Kushner “asked for more details,” and requested that his buddy M.B.S. “be transparent in the investigation process,” but didn’t really get any specifics about the conversation. Now, though, we’ve got a better idea of what might have been said! We’re just guessing here, but it seems likely Kushner opened the conversation by telling the prince, “A month from now, no one will even remember you were accused of murdering and dismembering a man; this is no worse than that time your army accidentally &lt;a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/09/saudi-uae-coalition-admits-yemen-school-bus-bombing-unjustified-180901141048148.html\"&gt;slaughtered a bunch of kids&lt;/a&gt;, and no one ever mentions that anymore,” and closed it by saying, “Everyone here has got your back,” and maybe, “I know what you’re going through,” and possibly, “I love you, man. We’ll get through this together.” &lt;a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/18/world/middleeast/jamal-khashoggi-killing-saudi-arabia.html\"&gt;Per &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Kushner, Mr. Trump’s son-in-law and Middle East adviser, has been urging the president to stand by Prince Mohammed, according to a person close to the White House and a former official with knowledge of the discussions.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Mr. Kushner has argued that the outrage over Mr. Khashoggi’s disappearance and possible killing will pass, just as it did after other Saudi errors like the kidnapping of the prime minister of Lebanon and the killing of a busload of children in Yemen by a Saudi airstrike.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update: after this story was published,&lt;/em&gt; The New York Times &lt;em&gt;revised its story to remove both lines about Kushner. The new version reads, “Mr. Kushner has argued that the crown prince can survive the outrage just as he has weathered past criticism.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Kushner, of course, doesn’t offer this kind of support for just &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; despot&amp;#8212;it is reserved for the ones with whom he’s forged close, personal friendships. As a reminder, Kushner and M.B.S. first bonded over lunch at the White House back in March 2017, and from there it’s basically been a Laverne and Shirley routine for the 21st century, if Laverne was a little rich boy who’s only held jobs given to him by his father or father-in-law, and Shirley got her rocks off &lt;a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-arrests-crownprince-insight/a-house-divided-how-saudi-crown-prince-purged-royal-family-rivals-idUSKBN1DA23M\"&gt;rounding up and imprisoning her own cousins&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, we assume that part, if not all, of the attraction between the two is based on the fact that they both know what it’s like to always get whatever they want and never pay any consequences. (“A source close to Kushner” denies the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; report is accurate, &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/jaketapper/status/1053010441541246978\"&gt;for what it’s worth&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Saudi rulers are reportedly considering throwing a top intelligence official, General &lt;strong&gt;Ahmed al-Assiri,&lt;/strong&gt; under the bus for the killing of Khashoggi&amp;#8212;who even Trump now says is &lt;a href=\"https://www.axios.com/trump-certainly-looks-like-jamal-khashoggi-is-dead-45527f78-e3f1-4ba8-8685-ceaeac8e382e.html\"&gt;probably dead&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8212;in an attempt to deflect blame from M.B.S. According to the &lt;em&gt;Times,&lt;/em&gt; Saudi officials are “expected to say that General Assiri received verbal authorization from Prince Mohammed to capture Mr. Khashoggi for an interrogation in Saudi Arabia, but either misunderstood his instructions or overstepped that authorization and took the dissident’s life.” Obviously, that explanation would concede the crown prince directed his personal goon squad to kidnap a U.S. resident for being mean to him, but hey, who &lt;em&gt;hasn’t&lt;/em&gt; done that? We’ve all done things &lt;a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/19/nyregion/major-donor-admits-hiring-prostitute-to-smear-witness.html\"&gt;we might regret&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article has been updated.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you would like to receive the Levin Report in your inbox daily, &lt;a href=\"http://tinyletter.com/besslevin\"&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt; to subscribe.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Goldman Sachs would rather not be sued by so many women for sexual harassment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So the bank is asking a judge to throw a bunch out of a class action lawsuit, &lt;a href=\"https://nypost.com/2018/10/18/goldman-sachs-wants-to-weed-out-women-in-class-action-suit/\"&gt;according to a new report&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Goldman claims that some of the unnamed women who are suing the bank, who claim they endured years of discrimination and underpayment, may have signed arbitration agreements, according to filings late Wednesday in Manhattan federal court.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Goldman argued in the court filings that it has the right to figure out if they do and force them to honor their agreements&amp;#8212;a process that could drag out the 13-year-old court battle for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;“Should these class members refuse to honor their agreements to arbitrate, Goldman Sachs will move to compel arbitration,” the bank said. . . . The filing comes about a month after the Manhattan federal appeals court ruled that the case, filed by four former female bankers, can proceed.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In a statement, lawyers for the women told the &lt;em&gt;Post,&lt;/em&gt; “Plaintiffs have relied on the pleadings of the last eight years to push their case, only to see Goldman now decide it would prefer a new venue when the court’s decision did not go its way.” &lt;strong&gt;Michael DuVally,&lt;/strong&gt; a spokesperson for the bank, referred to the court filing when asked for comment.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gary Cohn: Trump should zip it re: the Federal Reserve&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;According to the former National Economic Council director, it’s actually &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; appropriate for the president of the United States to call his hand-picked central bank “loco” and “the biggest threat” to his presidency just because he doesn’t like the rate hikes &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/trumps-not-gonna-let-a-little-murder-get-in-the-way-of-his-dollar110-billion-arms-deal\"&gt;he would have seen coming if he understood how any of this works&lt;/a&gt;. “I don’t think he should make comments on any independent agency,” Cohn told CNBC Thursday, saying “The Fed is doing their job as an independent agency.” The ex&amp;#8211;White House official also reiterated &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/03/gary-cohn-resignation\"&gt;his stance&lt;/a&gt; that tariffs are a terrible idea, commenting that “anything that raises the price of a good doesn’t make sense for our economy. Even if they’re paying it to the government as a tariff, it’s just another tax.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Morgan Stanley has a secret weapon in the fight for Uber’s I.P.O.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It’s an investment banker &lt;a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/morgan-stanley-bankers-side-gig-could-help-firm-land-highly-coveted-role-on-uber-ipo-1539855000?mod=hp_lead_pos5\"&gt;with a side job as an Uber driver&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[Michael] Grimes,&lt;/strong&gt; Morgan Stanley’s top technology banker, has moonlighted for years as a driver for the ride-hailing service, according to people familiar with the matter. That side hustle&amp;#8212;hardly necessary, given his multi-million-dollar Wall Street salary&amp;#8212;may help Morgan Stanley win a role on the most hotly anticipated stock-market debut in years. . . . Morgan Stanley has wooed Uber for years. When the bank authorized Uber rides for its employees traveling on business in 2014, it marked the occasion with a press release. In 2016, it arranged a $1.5 billion loan for Uber, the company’s first major borrowing and one of the first times a money-losing tech start-up had tapped the debt markets.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As the I.P.O. looms, Mr. Grimes took center stage. A fast-talking California native with a degree in computer science, he is known to put on a show for clients. Nearly a year ahead of Snap Inc.’s I.P.O., he rented an apartment blocks from the Snapchat parent’s Venice, California, office. When Morgan Stanley pitched music-streaming service Pandora Media Inc. on going public, Mr. Grimes had his bankers wear T-shirts from their favorite rock concerts.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To the banks who will inevitably lose out to Morgan Stanley here, you have only yourselves to blame. If you &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; want those deals fees, next time consider making one of your employees embed him or herself on the inside of the company.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JPMorgan has good news and less-good news&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The good news: there’s only a 28 percent chance there’ll be a U.S. recession within the next year. The less-good news: there’s a 60 percent probability of one within the next two years, and the odds of one over the next three are more than 80 percent, according a research note &lt;a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-18/u-s-recession-chances-in-next-two-years-top-60-jpmorgan-says\"&gt;put out by the bank&lt;/a&gt; and viewed by Bloomberg.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan’s model includes indicators ranging from consumer and business sentiment to prime-age male labor participation, compensation growth, and durables and structures as a share of gross domestic product. The bank’s gauge is more pessimistic than a recession tracker maintained by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which shows a 14.5 percent chance of a recession a year from now.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elsewhere!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dan Loeb&lt;/strong&gt; video says Campbell Soup is “Mmm, mmm, bad” (&lt;a href=\"https://nypost.com/2018/10/18/dan-loeb-video-says-campbell-soup-is-mmm-mmm-bad/\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;N.Y.P.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs sees five more Fed rate hikes through end of 2019 (&lt;a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-goldman-sachs-fed/goldman-sachs-sees-five-more-fed-rate-hikes-through-end-of-2019-idUSKCN1MS31J\"&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Market Keeps Punishing Stock Bulls (&lt;a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-18/monsters-around-every-corner-with-stock-market-in-punish-mode\"&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Trump threatens to summon military to close U.S.-Mexico border, upend trade deal in response to migrant caravan (&lt;a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-threatens-to-summon-military-to-close-us-mexico-border-in-response-to-migrant-caravan/2018/10/18/d427b1dc-d2bd-11e8-83d6-291fcead2ab1_story.html\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elizabeth Warren&lt;/strong&gt; calls on the Fed to demand Wells Fargo fire C.E.O. &lt;strong&gt;Tim Sloan&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/18/elizabeth-warren-calls-on-fed-to-demand-wells-fargo-fire-ceo-tim-sloan.html\"&gt;CNBC&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;“Goldman had to seize a customer’s yacht last year” (&lt;a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-18/goldman-morgan-stanley-seek-lending-growth-for-yachts-mansions\"&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Interior Department Says Inspector General Can Keep Her Job After All (&lt;a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-18/interior-department-says-watchdog-gets-to-keep-her-job-after-all\"&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Which is how &lt;strong&gt;Heidi [Cruz]&lt;/strong&gt; found herself planning a May wedding to a man who, for all his pretension, insisted they play “A Whole New World,” the popular Disney song, at the end of the ceremony.

href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/donald-trump-fred-trump-taxes\"&gt;detailing&lt;/a&gt; years of tax avoidance, tax dodging, and apparent outright tax fraud by his father-in-law, over the weekend it was &lt;strong&gt;Jared Kushner’s&lt;/strong&gt; turn to have his payments to the I.R.S.&amp;#8212;or lack thereof!&amp;#8212; &lt;a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/13/business/jared-kushner-taxes.html\"&gt;scrutinized&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;em&gt;The New York Times.&lt;/em&gt; According to reporters &lt;strong&gt;Jesse Drucker&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Emily Flitter,&lt;/strong&gt; what the First Son-in-Law &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/jared-kushner-hidden-genius\"&gt;lacks in I.Q.&lt;/a&gt; he makes up for in shrewd accountants and attorneys who’ve employed various tax-minimizing maneuvers that have allowed the Boy Prince of New Jersey to pay virtually no federal taxes over the past decade, despite his wealth quintupling to nearly $324 million over that period&amp;#8212;maneuvers that exist solely for a particular strain of wealthy people known as real-estate investors. It’s good to be the scion of a &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/03/jared-kushners-family-business-slumlord-tactics\"&gt;slumlord empire&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Per the paper of record, Kushner’s exceedingly low tax bills resulted from depreciation, a tax benefit that allows developers like him and the president to deduct a portion of the cost of their buildings from their taxable income each year, generating paper losses. Despite the fact that the White House adviser’s family business, Kushner Companies, has been profitable and generated millions in cash annually for young Jared, the depreciation deduction&amp;#8212;which assumes buildings decline in value when in fact they often gain&amp;#8212;has basically let him decide what his tax bill should be. And it may or may not surprise you to hear he often thought his federal tax bill should be zero, or in some cases, that the government ought to pay &lt;em&gt;him.&lt;/em&gt; A fun example of the latter came in 2015, when Kushner made $1.7 million from salary and investment gains but, thanks to $8.3 million in “losses” and a gross-adjusted income of negative $6.6 million, &lt;a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/13/business/kushner-paying-taxes.html\"&gt;received a $4,000 refund&lt;/a&gt;, or roughly the cost of a round-trip business-class ticket &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/trumps-not-gonna-let-a-little-murder-get-in-the-way-of-his-dollar110-billion-arms-deal\"&gt;from New York to Riyadh&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Unlike his father-in-law, or his dad &lt;strong&gt;Charles Kushner,&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/04/jared-kushners-dad-leave-my-boy-alone\"&gt;who went to jail for tax evasion (among other things)&lt;/a&gt;, there’s no evidence that Kushner did anything illegal when it comes to his taxes, but simply employed high-priced professionals to exploit highly lucrative loopholes that are there for the taking for people like him. But that’s not the best part! The &lt;em&gt;best&lt;/em&gt; part is that Jared was able to claim losses on properties he didn’t even buy with his own cash, and in fact, in most cases, for which he paid less than 1 percent of the purchase price: an amount that was usually covered by loans. In other words, Ivanka’s husband was “getting tax-reducing losses for spending someone else’s money.” Actually, we take it back&amp;#8212;that’s not the best part. It‘s definitely good&amp;#8212;paying taxes is for poor schlubs&amp;#8212;but the best part is probably that Jared and Trump have set themselves up to screw the I.R.S. even harder next year, and, god-willing, for years to come:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The White House last year championed a sweeping revision of the nation’s tax laws that expanded many of the benefits enjoyed by real-estate investors, allowing them to reap even larger deductions.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;“The Trump administration was in a position to clean up the tax code and promised to get rid of some of the complexity that certain taxpayers use to their advantage,” said &lt;strong&gt;Victor Fleischer,&lt;/strong&gt; a tax-law professor at the University of California-Irvine. “Instead, they doubled down on those provisions, particularly the ones they have familiarity with to benefit themselves.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;(In a uniquely evil twist, the legislation eliminated a benefit that allows investors to avoid capital-gains taxes on asset sales if they use the proceeds to buy more within a certain timeframe&amp;#8212;for all industries except real estate.)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Peter Mirijanian,&lt;/strong&gt; a spokesman for Jared’s lawyer, &lt;strong&gt;Abbe Lowell,&lt;/strong&gt; said the documents “obtained [by the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; were] in violation of the law and standard business-confidentiality agreements,” while adding that Kushner “properly filed and paid all taxes due under the law and regulations.” &lt;strong&gt;Larry Kudlow,&lt;/strong&gt; the White House’s National Economic Council director who believes the answer to all of life’s problems &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/03/larry-kudlow-wants-trump-to-cut-taxes-again\"&gt;is tax cuts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/10/14/17975066/ny-times-jared-kushner-taxes-ivanka-trump\"&gt;brushed Kushner criticism aside&lt;/a&gt; during a Sunday interview on ABC, saying that “these stories [don’t] have anything to them,” and “Americans respect success.” Meanwhile, &lt;strong&gt;Jonathan Blattmachr,&lt;/strong&gt; a trusts and estates lawyer, told the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;: “If I had to live my life over again, I would have been in the real-estate business. It’s fantastic. You get tax deductions for things you don’t pay for.”&lt;/p&gt;","rubric":"Death and Taxes","socialTitle":"Jared Kushner’s Guide to Gettin’ Rich: Pay No Federal Income Taxes","socialDescription":"One

The rally-tested notion fit into Trump’s larger campaign theme that America was being pushed around by countries that need us far more than we need them. But Trump’s evolving, uncertain response to the brutal murder of dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul has shown little of this bravado. He’s often seemed to follow the Saudi lead, as if the U.S. needs the Saudis more than they need us. “This is one of the rare times I’ve seen Trump struggle. There’s no real leadership. It’s a disaster,” one former West Wing official told me.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;According to five Republicans briefed on internal White House discussions, Trump is torn between his instincts to fight and punish and the advice he’s receiving from advisers to stick by Saudi Arabia’s 33-year-old crown prince, &lt;strong&gt;Mohammed bin Salman,&lt;/strong&gt; better known by his initials, M.B.S. “&lt;strong&gt;Mike Pompeo&lt;/strong&gt; is telling him this is a decision with 10-year consequences,” one source said. The most determined backstage voice pushing to not upend the relationship is that of Trump’s son-in-law, &lt;strong&gt;Jared Kushner,&lt;/strong&gt; who has made M.B.S. a central node in his yet-to-be-seen Israeli-Palestinian peace plan. Speaking at a CNN forum yesterday, Kushner &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/jared-kushner-van-jones-interview\"&gt;waved away&lt;/a&gt; a question about the shifting explanations Saudi Arabia has offered about Khashoggi’s disappearance. “I see things that are deceptive every day. I see them in the Middle East, I see them in Washington&amp;#8212;and so, again, I think that we have our eyes wide open.”  (The White House declined to comment.)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;From the beginning of Trump’s presidency, Kushner insisted that out-of-the-box thinking was the way to find a path forward in the Middle East. He boasted to a prominent journalist with deep experience in the region that he didn’t need to read books about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, a person briefed on the conversation recalled. It was Kushner’s belief&amp;#8212;one shared by his father-in-law&amp;#8212;that the conflict between Arabs and Israelis was essentially a real-estate problem, a deal to be worked out. “This was Jared’s vision,” one former West Wing official told me. Key to this dealmaking would be the creation of a new strategic alliance between Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates to counter Iran. Kushner bet big on M.B.S., encouraging Trump to make Riyadh his first trip abroad as president (it was there that Trump was photographed touching that glowing orb). The Arab face of this effort was M.B.S., a charismatic young prince who spoke the language of Silicon Valley and women’s rights. Such was Kushner’s confidence that there was West Wing talk about a Nobel Peace Prize for Trump’s work in the region, a former White House official said.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But there were warning signs early on that M.B.S. wasn’t the enlightened reformer he positioned himself to be. About a week after meeting secretly with Kushner in late October 2017, M.B.S. launched a brutal crackdown, locking up Saudi billionaires in the Riyadh Ritz-Carlton until they signed over billions to the government. As reports of instances of torture inside the Ritz circulated in the media, Trump’s national security team became alarmed. One national security official called former secretary of state &lt;strong&gt;Condoleezza Rice&lt;/strong&gt; for advice. Rice’s message was that “none of these guys are perfect” and Trump should give M.B.S. a chance. “While there were some concerns about doing business with M.B.S., we really believed he was a reformer and big change, socially, was possible,” a former official said. “The real issue is, we made a deal with the devil when we aligned with the Saudis 70 years ago. We have no other options,” another former member of Trump’s national security team recalled.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Khashoggi’s death at the hands of 15 Saudi agents, many with ties to M.B.S., is testing the cold truth at the heart of the American-Saudi partnership. While Kushner’s embrace of M.B.S. had strategic logic, it has been a source of frustration for administration officials. &lt;strong&gt;John Bolton’s&lt;/strong&gt; deputy, &lt;strong&gt;Mira Ricardel,&lt;/strong&gt; recently told colleagues that “Jared is out of his league,” one Republican briefed on her remarks said. (“The assertion, made from a single unnamed source, is flat wrong,” one White House official told me.) Kushner’s private WhatsApp chats with M.B.S. were a particular source of concern for Defense Secretary &lt;strong&gt;James Mattis,&lt;/strong&gt; former secretary of state &lt;strong&gt;Rex Tillerson,&lt;/strong&gt; and former national security adviser &lt;strong&gt;H.R. McMaster.&lt;/strong&gt; “McMaster was especially unhappy Jared was involved in the Mideast. I remember McMaster yelling about the WhatsApp conversations and he kept saying, ‘What’s WhatsApp?’” a former N.S.C. official recalled. (McMaster did not respond to a request for comment.) Before Kushner sat for the CNN interview, his silence about Khashoggi’s murder had become a topic of discussion among current and former West Wing colleagues. “Jared went from running point on the Mideast to &lt;em&gt;running,&lt;/em&gt;” a former official said. A joke in the West Wing has been that Kushner&amp;#8212;who has a well-documented habit of departing Washington at fortuitous times&amp;#8212;will soon be heading to Colorado for a ski vacation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In the West Wing, there’s still a strong belief that pushing M.B.S. too far threatens the entire Middle East strategy. But the same is not true in Congress. &lt;strong&gt;Lindsey Graham,&lt;/strong&gt; a reliable Trump ally in recent months, argued that the Magnitsky Act could potentially be invoked, and said he believes M.B.S. is “responsible for the killing of Mr. Khashoggi in the most brutal way.” M.B.S., the strategic linchpin, is now dangerously compromised. It’s a bind, one that threatens Trump’s thus-far-charmed relationship with the Republican Congress, and with implications for 2020. For Trump, the way forward is far from clear. “This is not going to blow over,” said one former West Wing official.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story has been updated.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;More Great Stories from &lt;em&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212; Uber wants to be the next Amazon; but it &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/uber-the-next-amazon-but-others-see-the-next-yahoo?inline\"&gt;could end up the next Yahoo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212; Meet the fake Saudi prince with a &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2018/10/he-actually-believes-he-is-khalid-the-odyssey-of-a-counterfeit-saudi-prince?inline\"&gt;30-year plan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212; We talked to the most &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/inside-yamam-top-secret-israeli-anti-terrorism-operation?inline\"&gt;elite counterterrorism unit in the world&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212; Why Michael Bloomberg’s cash bombs might &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/michael-bloomberg-funds-democrats-in-2018?inline\"&gt;not actually help him be president&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212; &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/where-is-barack-obama-2018-midterms?inline\"&gt;Where is Obama?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Looking for more? &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/newsletters\"&gt;Sign up&lt;/a&gt; for our daily Hive newsletter and never miss a story.&lt;/p&gt;","rubric":"Saudi Arabia","socialTitle":"“This Was Jared’s Vision”: As Kushner’s Bet on M.B.S.

What I’ve done working with him on the Middle East peace plan, it is so unbelievably well done . . . and [Jared and &lt;strong&gt;Ivanka&lt;/strong&gt;] do a lot of things behind the scenes that I wish more people knew about because we’re a better country because they’re in this administration.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"&gt;&lt;blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/joshtpm/status/1049678319812337668\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/joshtpm/status/1049678319812337668\"&gt;https://twitter.com/joshtpm/status/1049678319812337668&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fact that this is the first time Kushner has ever been described in such terms by anyone&amp;#8212;save for the time Trump administration hanger-on &lt;strong&gt;Anthony Scaramucci&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/05/anthony-scaramucci-media-nosy\"&gt;called him a 21st-century Alexander Hamilton&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8212;and that there is zero evidence to back it up, does not mean it‘s not true. Instead, it simply underscores the fact that all those instances in which Jared made us &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; he was a total moron were simply cover.

Telling reporters he’d “heard Ivanka” mentioned as a potential candidate to replace Haley, President Daddy &lt;a href=\"https://nypost.com/2018/10/09/trump-ivanka-would-be-dynamite-as-un-ambassador/\"&gt;added&lt;/a&gt; that his “people know that Ivanka would be dynamite” and that his endorsement has “nothing to do with nepotism,” despite his eldest daughter having zero other qualifications for the job besides being related to the guy who gets to decide who is nominated. Perhaps worried that the haters and losers would discount her relevant work experience &lt;a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2018/07/24/ivankas-fashion-lie-is-finished/\"&gt;selling&lt;/a&gt; knockoff &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/06/ivanka-trump-sued-luxury-sandals\"&gt;shoes and dresses&lt;/a&gt;, Trump added he would “be accused of nepotism, even though I’m not sure there is anybody more competent in the world.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But alas, it will not come to be, according to a statement put out by Princess Purses herself:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"&gt;&lt;blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/IvankaTrump/status/1049773378167590912\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/IvankaTrump/status/1049773378167590912\"&gt;https://twitter.com/IvankaTrump/status/1049773378167590912&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wells Fargo is doubling down on guns&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And its nun shareholders&amp;#8212;not to mention &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/05/gop-lawmakers-offended-by-banks-attempts-to-cut-down-on-mass-shootings\"&gt;people who think banks have an obligation to do something about the shooting epidemic in America&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8212;are &lt;a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-05/unswayed-by-nuns-wells-fargo-hands-gunmaker-new-line-of-credit\"&gt;pissed&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The San Francisco-based bank last week issued a $40 million line of credit to gun manufacturer Sturm, Ruger &amp;amp; Co., according to financial filings. That’s on top of the $431 million in debt that Wells Fargo has arranged for gunmakers since December 2012, when the Sandy Hook school shooting escalated the gun control debate. No other bank lent more to the industry over that time, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The new debt, issued to one of the world’s largest publicly traded gunmakers, came as a big surprise to at least one group: nuns who had been talking to Wells Fargo about corporate-responsibility issues. On September 26, the day before the debt agreement was issued, they had met with the bank’s business-standards employees in New York.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;“This is shocking news because we are in sustained dialogue with Wells Fargo,” &lt;strong&gt;Nora Nash,&lt;/strong&gt; a sister at St. Francis of Philadelphia, told Bloomberg. “This new business relationship with Sturm Ruger is in direct conflict with ethics, culture, and respect for human rights throughout the company.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bill Ackman’s year is looking up&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Pershing Square hedge-fund manager Bill Ackman’s 2017 involved &lt;a href=\"https://pagesix.com/2017/03/23/bill-ackmans-new-romance-complicates-big-money-divorce/\"&gt;a divorce&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"http://fortune.com/2017/03/15/valeant-stock-bill-ackman/\"&gt;$4 billion loss&lt;/a&gt;. At one point in January 2018, things were so bad that he had to slum it on the subway having &lt;a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/billionaire-bill-ackmans-hedge-fund-lays-off-staff-including-his-driver-2018-01-23\"&gt;reportedly laid off his driver&lt;/a&gt;.

While &lt;strong&gt;Vladimir Putin&lt;/strong&gt; will always have a special place in Trump’s heart, another clear favorite is Saudi Crown Prince &lt;strong&gt;Mohammed bin Salman,&lt;/strong&gt; who ingratiated himself with the ex&amp;#8211;real estate developer by agreeing to a multi-billion-dollar arms deal that allowed Trump to maintain the illusion of being a successful businessman. In exchange, the president of the United States has basically cheered on the prince’s human-rights abuses. Last November, with the &lt;a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-saudi-royal-purge-with-trumps-consent\"&gt;tacit support of the president&lt;/a&gt;, M.B.S., as he &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/04/prince-mohammed-does-hollywood\"&gt;is known&lt;/a&gt;, rounded up 200 businessmen, Saudi officials, and family members as part of a crackdown on alleged corruption, and &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/01/saudi-prince-alwaleed-bin-talal-says-imprisonment-was-misunderstandig\"&gt;detained them for months&lt;/a&gt; at the Riyadh Ritz-Carlton&amp;#8212;a move Trump &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/11/trump-praises-saudi-royal-purge\"&gt;publicly &lt;em&gt;endorsed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In August, Team Trump essentially &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/08/trump-abandons-canada-as-prince-mohammed-blows-his-top\"&gt;gave&lt;/a&gt; Saudi Arabia its blessing to expel Canada’s ambassador, ban new trade, freeze Saudi Airlines flights to Canada, and order the withdrawal of more than 12,000 Saudi citizens studying in Canada, after our neighbors to the north mildly condemned the arrests of several political activists, and called for their release. But a recent incident&amp;#8212;wherein Saudi Arabia may have kidnapped and murdered a journalist who has been critical of the regime&amp;#8212;could make it tough for Trump to look the other way. Though lord knows &lt;a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/disappearance-and-alleged-killing-of-saudi-journalist-jamal-khashoggi-could-complicate-us-saudi-relations/2018/10/07/93693ace-ca4f-11e8-a360-85875bac0b1f_story.html\"&gt;he’s trying&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The disappearance and alleged killing last week of dissident Saudi Arabian journalist &lt;strong&gt;Jamal Khashoggi&lt;/strong&gt; while he was visiting the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul is only the latest challenge to a U.S.-Saudi relationship that both governments have diligently cultivated.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration has said little beyond expressing public concern over Khashoggi’s fate, and the kingdom has sharply denied any knowledge of his whereabouts.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Turkish investigators charge that that is not true in the slightest, &lt;a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/07/world/middleeast/turkey-jamal-khashoggi-saudi-arabia.html\"&gt;telling&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; and other news outlets that Khashoggi, who went to the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul to obtain a marriage document, was killed and dismembered by a 15-man team of Saudi agents. “There is concrete information,” &lt;strong&gt;Yasin Aktay,&lt;/strong&gt; an adviser to the head of Turkey’s governing A.K.P. party, said during an interview on Sunday. “It will not remain an unsolved case.” That’s made things rather uncomfortable in Washington where, per the &lt;em&gt;Times,&lt;/em&gt; “many current and former American officials are friendly with Mr. Khashoggi, a resident of the United States,” but the president and his son-in-law, &lt;strong&gt;Jared Kushner,&lt;/strong&gt; are &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/03/saudi-arabia-united-arab-emirates-jared-kushner-robert-mueller\"&gt;tight&lt;/a&gt; with his alleged killers. Thus far, State Department officials have said only that the U.S. cannot confirm Khashoggi’s status, but that they are following the case.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Lawmakers have reacted, understandably, with a little more outrage. “If this is true&amp;#8212;that the Saudis lured a U.S. resident into their consulate and murdered him&amp;#8212;it should represent a fundamental break in our relationship with Saudi Arabia,” Senator &lt;strong&gt;Chris Murphy&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/ChrisMurphyCT/status/1048692780849979393\"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter, while Senator &lt;strong&gt;Tim Kaine&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/timkaine/status/1048958296852520960\"&gt;added&lt;/a&gt;: “We must get to the bottom of what happened and then impose strong consequences. Targeting journalists must stop.” It’s not clear that the president agrees.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: Trump has said he doesn’t like what he’s hearing and hopes the kidnapping and &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/AmichaiStein1/status/1049403264612093960\"&gt;dismemberment&lt;/a&gt; “sort itself out”:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"&gt;&lt;blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/maggieNYT/status/1049411909492101120\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/maggieNYT/status/1049411909492101120\"&gt;https://twitter.com/maggieNYT/status/1049411909492101120&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;","rubric":"Foreign Policy","socialTitle":"Will Jared Let His Saudi Buddy M.B.S.

But Kushner went ahead with it as planned. And then he hung with Rupert.","body":"&lt;p&gt;On Monday afternoon, &lt;strong&gt;Jared Kushner&lt;/strong&gt; wore a tight smile across his face as he strode offstage following a live interview with CNN’s &lt;strong&gt;Van Jones.&lt;/strong&gt; Their conversation, which took place at the Time Warner Center, in Columbus Circle, was among the most significant draws of the network’s first-ever Citizen by CNN event&amp;#8212;a full-day live affair featuring conversations with newsmakers, as interviewed by the network’s talent, all broadcast live on air and across the Internet. The event, it seemed, was both intended to break news and serve as Kushner’s cable-news debut, in his first sit-down since his father-in-law took office.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Citizen by CNN roster was stacked with power players from across the aisle&amp;#8212;House Speaker &lt;strong&gt;Nancy Pelosi,&lt;/strong&gt; Senator &lt;strong&gt;Jeff Flake,&lt;/strong&gt; Chicago Mayor and Obama chief of staff &lt;strong&gt;Rahm Emanuel,&lt;/strong&gt; former Trump White House lawyer &lt;strong&gt;Ty Cobb,&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Bob Woodward,&lt;/strong&gt; who wrote the barn-burning book exposing some of the most horrific accounts of a dysfunctional Trump West Wing. The Jones-Kushner conversation was also a useful case in point. The two men represented the opposite ends of the political spectrum&amp;#8212;Kushner works for the Republican president; Jones is a liberal pundit&amp;#8212;but have been working together on roundtables and policy discussions surrounding Kushner’s prison-reform initiative in the West Wing. It was also a fantastic publicity magnet. Despite his political ubiquity, Kushner remains an enigma, even to many of the political-media insiders who packed the room, many of whom still didn’t know what his voice sounded like.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The event was scheduled well before the Trump administration was embroiled in the fallout surrounding the death of &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; journalist Jamal Khashoggi, which has put a strain between Kushner and Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince &lt;strong&gt;Mohammed bin Salman.&lt;/strong&gt; While much has been speculated about Kushner’s evolving relationship with M.B.S., who he has cultivated as an ally since Trump took office, Kushner had yet to say anything publicly. This weekend, people close to Kushner weighed whether or not he should cancel his CNN appearance, they said, but Kushner decided to go on as planned.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It was a calculated P.R. move in the midst of what has been a treacherous month. Kushner could, perhaps, score some points for Team Trump by appearing at an event put on by CNN, which the president has long construed as inimical territory. Kushner himself had tussled with the network during the campaign, clashing with CNN president &lt;strong&gt;Jeff Zucker&lt;/strong&gt; over Trump coverage during the summer of 2016. They later reached a détente in a pre-election sit-down in the same building where Kushner got onstage Monday, according to people familiar with the situation. The conversation with Van Jones offered another, mutually beneficial denouement. Kushner, who many had hoped might be a moderating voice in the administration, presented himself as more of a pragmatist than a partisan, though the longtime Democrat made it clear he agrees with his father-in-law more often than many might have figured. “I agree with a lot of the things he’s pushing for,” he told Jones, when asked about his influence and ability to sway Trump. “I’ll make the case on certain things and&amp;#8212;but he’ll do what he wants to do. . . . lot of the things we have done have made the country better.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;That he had a comfortable relationship with Jones made it less daunting. They spent a fair amount of time talking about “how Kushner’s mind works”; he brought up the fact that Kushner had recently been called a ”hidden genius,” and wondered how he score ”the dopest job in the world.” He lobbed softballs about being married to &lt;strong&gt;Ivanka Trump&lt;/strong&gt; and asked, “Are you having fun?” Kushner, meanwhile, dodged specifics when Jones did ask about the Khashoggi affair. (Kushner insisted that the administration was still in the “fact-finding phase . . . [to] determine which facts are credible” and qualified the concerns over the reliability of the Saudi account by joking that he sees “things that are deceptive every day.”)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Kushner made clear that he is not the one calling the shots&amp;#8212;that the president, Secretary of State &lt;strong&gt;Mike Pompeo,&lt;/strong&gt; and National Security Adviser &lt;strong&gt;John Bolton&lt;/strong&gt; are the ones taking the reins and that his responsibilities within the West Wing do not include the &lt;em&gt;entire&lt;/em&gt; Middle East; he explained that he has been tasked with the Middle East peace process and that others are responsible for the rest. Privately, however, Kushner has &lt;a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/22/world/middleeast/kushner-khashoggi-prince-mbs.html\"&gt;communicated with M.B.S. several times&lt;/a&gt; over the last week. Because of his relationship with the crown prince, according to someone familiar with the situation, he has been able to apply some pressure when he has been asked to. Indeed, Kushner told Jones on Monday that he has urged M.B.S. to be transparent because “the world is watching.” He wouldn’t elaborate on the specifics of his advice to Trump, though there have been reports over the last week that he told his father-in-law to wait before jumping to conclusions about what happened to Khashoggi.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;At the end of it all, those around Kushner felt like it was a success. He had managed to tout some of his accomplishments while towing the administration’s line on Khashoggi. Afterward, Kushner left the Time Warner Center and headed to more comfortable ground outside the glare of news camera. He sat down with News Corp executive chairman and longtime friend &lt;strong&gt;Rupert Murdoch,&lt;/strong&gt; according to the person familiar with the situation, before taking a flight back to Washington. Later that evening, Ivanka posted a link to the Van Jones interview for her 5.8 million Twitter followers to watch. “I am continuously impressed by his incredible work ethic, laser focus, and quiet achievement as he serves our great country,” she wrote.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;More Great Stories from &lt;em&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212; Uber wants to be the next Amazon; but it &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/uber-the-next-amazon-but-others-see-the-next-yahoo?inline\"&gt;could end up the next Yahoo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212; Meet the fake Saudi prince with a &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2018/10/he-actually-believes-he-is-khalid-the-odyssey-of-a-counterfeit-saudi-prince?inline\"&gt;30-year plan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212; We talked to the most &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/inside-yamam-top-secret-israeli-anti-terrorism-operation?inline\"&gt;elite counterterrorism unit in the world&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212; Why Michael Bloomberg’s cash bombs might &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/michael-bloomberg-funds-democrats-in-2018?inline\"&gt;not actually help him be president&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212; &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/where-is-barack-obama-2018-midterms?inline\"&gt;Where is Obama?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Looking for more? &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/newsletters\"&gt;Sign up&lt;/a&gt; for our daily Hive newsletter and never miss a story.&lt;/p&gt;","rubric":"The First Family","socialTitle":"In Kushnerworld, His Cable-News Debut Was a Win","socialDescription":"People in Kushner’s orbit wondered whether he would withdraw from the CNN event.

First Son-in-Law has been dispatched to win over moneyed elites.","body":"&lt;p&gt;When &lt;strong&gt;Jared Kushner&lt;/strong&gt; first joined the White House as a senior adviser to his father-in-law, he was tasked with bringing peace to to the Middle East, solving the opioid crisis, overhauling the government’s I.T. infrastructure, and, in his spare time, “&lt;a href=\"https://thinkprogress.org/7-jobs-jared-kushner-is-now-doing-for-the-united-states-of-america-6f0a799462ed/\"&gt;re-inventing the entire government&lt;/a&gt;.” Twenty months later, how’s that all working out for him? Not so great! To be fair, Kushner’s lack of progress can probably be attributed to a number of factors, including the period in which &lt;a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/23/us/politics/jared-kushner-security-clearance.html\"&gt;he had his security clearance downgraded&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/03/jared-kushners-family-business-slumlord-tactics\"&gt;distractions&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/03/jared-kushners-weeping-inconsolably-in-a-janitors-closet\"&gt;at the&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/10/jared-kushner-worlds-worst-real-estate-developer\"&gt;family business&lt;/a&gt;, and his utter lack of experience with any of the tasks at hand. But that’s O.K.! Because the Boy Prince of New Jersey has been given a shiny new assignment: convincing millionaires and billionaires that &lt;strong&gt;Donald Trump’s&lt;/strong&gt; administration isn’t the royally incompetent, absolute clusterf--k it would appear to be.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Politico &lt;a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2018/09/23/kushner-wealthy-donors-trump-837392\"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that young Jared has been crisscrossing the country to appear at various events attended by elite donors and make the case that while his father-in-law’s administration &lt;em&gt;looks&lt;/em&gt; like a hot mess of incompetence with a dash of narcissistic personality disorder and a sprig of complete and utter chaos (plus, a heaping dose of unbridled corruption on the side), nothing could be further from the truth. Some of these people are actually buying it:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;His tour began last month, when he appeared at a donor retreat hosted by Ryan in Jackson Hole, Wyo. At a mountaintop restaurant, Kushner&amp;#8212;who saw the event as an opportunity to address a group of establishment-aligned donors who weren’t fully on board with Trump’s 2016 campaign&amp;#8212;spoke on a range of policy issues. His wife, &lt;strong&gt;Ivanka Trump,&lt;/strong&gt; attended with him.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Karen Kemmerer,&lt;/strong&gt; a Wyoming-based contributor who was in the audience that evening, acknowledged she initially felt some skepticism toward Kushner, a newcomer to government. But she said she came away impressed.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;“I think certainly for my husband and I, before meeting either of them, we had on our minds like, ‘What backgrounds and capabilities do they really have to be working in the White House? What kind of experiences do they have? What are they doing? I don’t want to say we had a negative impression, but we were kind of neutral,” she said. “So it was really very eye-opening to hear from both of them that night. And I think the majority of the other donors felt the same way.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Other events have included a dinner at New York City’s Pierre Hotel&amp;#8212;attended by New England Patriots owner &lt;strong&gt;Robert Kraft,&lt;/strong&gt; billionaire investor &lt;strong&gt;Ira Renner,&lt;/strong&gt; Democratic mega-donor &lt;strong&gt;Haim Saban,&lt;/strong&gt; Chicago Cubs owner &lt;strong&gt;Todd Ricketts,&lt;/strong&gt; and billionaire hedge-fund manager &lt;strong&gt;Paul Singer&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#8212;where the First Son-in-Law detailed his work on trade, prison reform, and “the administration’s unorthodox approach to foreign policy.“ (According to longtime Kushner pal &lt;strong&gt;Ken Kurson,&lt;/strong&gt; donors “walked in doubting that the president has serious, thoughtful people around him,” but “left feeling reassured”). Last week, he headlined a fund-raiser in Ohio for Representative &lt;strong&gt;Jim Jordan,&lt;/strong&gt; who‘s been &lt;a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/19/gop-rep-steve-stivers-explains-why-jim-jordan-is-still-in-congress.html\"&gt;accused&lt;/a&gt; by wrestlers he coached at Ohio State of ignoring sexual abuse (Jordan has &lt;a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/fourth-ohio-state-wrestler-says-rep-jim-jordan-knew-about-n889071\"&gt;denied&lt;/a&gt; knowing anything about the abuse). While Kushner&amp;#8212;whose event at the Pierre came on the same day Donald Trump &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/09/trump-death-toll-puerto-rico-democrat-hoax\"&gt;claimed that

The Democratic candidate, who has served in the House since 2009, beat Republican candidate &lt;strong&gt;Walker Stapleton&lt;/strong&gt;  with a healthy 6 percent margin, and in his speech, he noted the historic significance of his win:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;“I also want to take a moment to acknowledge where we are and how we got here,” Polis said in a speech to supporters, taking the stage &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/NicGarcia/status/1060007520972955648\"&gt;to the tune&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;strong&gt;Bob Dylan’s&lt;/strong&gt; “The Times They Are a-Changin.’” He continued, “Tonight, right here in Colorado, we proved that we’re an inclusive state that values every contribution, regardless of someone’s sexual orientation or gender identity.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"embed block video row\"&gt;&lt;div class=\"wrapper\"&gt;&lt;iframe height=\"360\" width=\"640\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/krV86TmezbQ\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allowtransparency=\"true\"&gt; &lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/6/26/17492536/2018-midterms-jared-polis-colorado-first-openly-gay-elected-governor\"&gt;Vox pointed out&lt;/a&gt; in June, Polis’s victory will mean that his partner, &lt;strong&gt;Marlon Reis,&lt;/strong&gt; and children &lt;strong&gt;Cora&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Caspian,&lt;/strong&gt; will join him in the governor’s mansion, making them the country’s first same-sex First Family. Though Polis had a substantial polling lead throughout his campaign, and Colorado has &lt;a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/09/the-state-that-fell-off-the-map/499529/\"&gt;skewed liberal&lt;/a&gt; in recent elections, there were accusations of homophobia among his opponents; as recently as October 26, Vail, Colorado, authorities were alerted to offensive stickers that said “Don’t vote for Jerod [sic] Polis or he’ll love your ass.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Polis’s victory was the most high-profile of several major election-night victories for L.G.B.T.Q rights. In Massachusetts, voters &lt;a href=\"https://www.bostonmagazine.com/news/2018/11/06/yes-on-3-wins/\"&gt;affirmed&lt;/a&gt; a bill that protects the rights of transgender people. &lt;strong&gt;Chris Pappas,&lt;/strong&gt; another Democrat, became the first openly gay congressman from New Hampshire, and &lt;strong&gt;Sharice Davids&lt;/strong&gt; became not only the first openly L.G.B.T.Q. congressperson from Kansas, but the first Native American woman to be elected to Congress. And there were many others, as summed up by this Twitter thread from INTO writer &lt;strong&gt;Mathew Rodriguez.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"embed block row

in a night that proved difficult for large, statewide progressive victories, Polis in particular stood out.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;“For the L.G.B.T.Q pioneers for equality in the generations before me&amp;#8212;who endured so much hardship and hurt to make it possible for so many of us, myself included, to live and to love openly and proudly&amp;#8212;and to the people right here in this room, I

On Thursday, the model posted a photo of her and her now-husband, &lt;strong&gt;Joshua Kushner,&lt;/strong&gt; at their small upstate wedding, with the simple caption: “10.18.2018.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Kloss wore a custom Dior gown for the Jewish ceremony where just under 80 people watched the couple get married. A spokesperson for Kloss confirmed to &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt; that the two did indeed wed, while a friend who attended said, “The wedding was intimate and moving. The couple was beaming with happiness.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The wedding came as a surprise. Kloss &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2018/07/karlie-kloss-and-josh-kushners-wedding-will-have-an-unbelievable-guest-list\"&gt;announced their engagement&lt;/a&gt; in July, weeks after Kushner proposed to her in upstate New York.

Kloss is now in-laws with &lt;strong&gt;Jared Kushner&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Ivanka Trump,&lt;/strong&gt; with the latter congratulating the model by calling her “sister” via Instagram after she announced her engagement, &lt;a href=\"https://www.glamour.com/story/ivanka-trump-just-called-karlie-kloss-her-sister-on-instagram\"&gt;writing&lt;/a&gt;, “So, so happy for you and Josh!

of Jamal Khashoggi.","body":"&lt;section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was, to be sure, a discomfiting scene: there was Secretary of State &lt;strong&gt;Mike Pompeo&lt;/strong&gt; amiably clutching the hand of Saudi Crown Prince &lt;strong&gt;Mohammed bin Salman&lt;/strong&gt; in an ornate meeting room in Riyadh a mere fortnight after &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; columnist and Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi had gone missing. The steady drumbeat of revelations had been perplexing and damning and almost inconceivable: the video evidence of Khashoggi entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul; the reports of a 15-person Saudi “kill” team landing in the city, including a so-called bone-saw expert; and &lt;strong&gt;Donald Trump’s&lt;/strong&gt; myriad equivocations. Yet as evidence increasingly suggested a connection between M.B.S. and the presumed murder, Pompeo’s visit seemed like the latest assault to diplomacy. Despite what should have been a somber, mordant affair, he looked like Ed McMahon about to present an oversize check before the camera. (On Friday night, the Saudis conceded what everyone had long known: Khashoggi was dead.)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Back in Washington, members of the diplomatic and intelligence community that I spoke with were gobsmacked. While Axios has &lt;a href=\"https://www.axios.com/saudi-arabia-mike-pompeo-meeting-jamal-khashoggi-1480d505-dcbc-46cb-97e0-34ba5a08655f.html\"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that Pompeo uttered harsh words beneath his avuncular civility, many found the optics insurmountable. “The grip and grin sort of stunned people who saw it,” a congressional aide told me. “There is a lack of confidence that he is doing everything in his power to actually get the truth in this case.” Among diplomatic veterans, Pompeo’s affable demeanor was a real misstep. “Pompeo did not handle this well,” a former high-ranking State Department official sighed. “I don’t think it would have been difficult to be more somber in meetings and more nuanced in comments afterward.” As one State department official lamented to me, “Certainly from where I sit, it is discouraging to see the administration seemingly subordinate our values to other interests in such an egregious case.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Since reports of Khashoggi’s disappearance first began to circulate, Trump has signaled that the death of one journalist&amp;#8212;a citizen of Saudi Arabia, not the United States&amp;#8212;was not worth rupturing the U.S.-Saudi relationship. Last week, the president said it would be a “very tough pill to swallow for our country” if the kingdom was found to be responsible for the assumed killing of Khashoggi, and a $110 billion U.S. arms sales deal with Saudi Arabia was correspondingly imperiled. And despite mounting evidence that M.B.S. was involved, Trump suggested as recently as Monday that “rogue killers” could have been behind the hit. “I have never seen anything quite like that, with the president playing the role of defense lawyer to someone who appears to have murdered a U.S. resident overseas in flagrant violation of every diplomatic norm,” &lt;strong&gt;Daniel Benaim,&lt;/strong&gt; who served as a Middle East adviser to Vice President &lt;strong&gt;Joe Biden,&lt;/strong&gt; told me. “Not to even pretend to have an interest in the rule of law, and to jump straight to the part where you whitewash others’ crimes, is a gross abdication of American values.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;“The president was making excuses for the Saudis. The president, normally, would never do that,” said another former high-ranking State Department official who served in the Middle East. Instead, this source explained, a typical president would stress the seriousness of the situation, praise Khashoggi and the free press, call for an investigation&amp;#8212;possibly by the United Nations&amp;#8212;and rally U.S. allies to consolidate intelligence. By no means would he or she have expressed concerns that the arms agreement could become collateral. “There would be no indication one way or the other of what we were going to be doing,” they said.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not hyperbole to suggest that the Trump administration’s handling of the M.B.S. matter could well define the second half of the president’s term. The U.S.-Saudi relationship impacts everything, on a meta level, from oil prices to the Middle East peace puzzle. More specifically, Saudi Arabia has used its vast sovereign wealth fund, the Public Investment Fund, to intertwine itself with the American financial community&amp;#8212;Saudi money flows through Uber, JPMorgan Chase, Blackstone, Snap, and, &lt;a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2018/10/16/shiny-hollywood-partnership-with-saudi-arabia-suddenly-thrown-its-head/?utm_term=.92779c3aadda\"&gt;until recently&lt;/a&gt;, William Morris Endeavor. It’s also a bulwark against a nuclear Iran, a sort of inelegant centerpiece of Israel’s defense.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;More so than during the early crises of his presidency, Trump appears to comprehend the complexity of it all, which may be what has rendered his administration’s response so limp. Earlier this month, Trump harangued on Twitter that M.B.S. was innocent until proven guilty, a similar refrain he had used to protect &lt;strong&gt;Brett Kavanaugh’s&lt;/strong&gt; nomination. In the end, he seems to be hoping that the whole thing will blow over.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This defensiveness largely falls flat among his fellow lawmakers. “Across the Hill, there is just absolute disgust at what seems to have taken place, and bewilderment over the way the administration has reacted. And I think that runs the gamut from people whose baseline position would be deeply skeptical of the U.S.-Saudi relationship to people who have been traditionally strong supporters of the U.S.-Saudi relationship,” the congressional staffer told me. “By and large, the reaction on the Hill is outrage, and an insistence that we get ourselves a full, clear accounting and a deep skepticism that the Saudis are investigating this on their own&amp;#8212;despite Secretary Pompeo’s assurances&amp;#8212;are really going to provide clarity.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Benaim distilled the dissonance. “Other administrations would certainly have struggled with how to balance America’s values and interests, given the way a case like this impacts both,” he told me. “But Donald Trump doesn’t seem to have that struggle.” Instead, Trump says the quiet part out loud. “In a funny way, what you see is Donald Trump basically adopting the left-wing critique of the U.S.-Saudi relationship&amp;#8212;which reduces a very complex situation with a lot of different variables&amp;#8212;to basically, ‘They can get away with murder, because they are going to buy our weapons.’ He is actually taking the leftist critique of the relationship&amp;#8212;and embracing it.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the Khashoggi drama has unfolded, the close relationship between M.B.S. and &lt;strong&gt;Jared Kushner,&lt;/strong&gt; Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, has come under renewed scrutiny. (&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/18/world/middleeast/jamal-khashoggi-killing-saudi-arabia.html\"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; this week that Kushner was advocating on M.B.S.’s behalf within the White House.) Their relationship dates back to the early days of Trump’s presidency, when &lt;strong&gt;Rex Tillerson&lt;/strong&gt; was still running the State Department. As &lt;strong&gt;Dexter Filkins&lt;/strong&gt; has &lt;a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/in-the-wake-of-khashoggis-disappearance-saudi-arabias-crown-prince-is-pushed-to-the-brink\"&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker,&lt;/em&gt; Kushner identified M.B.S. as a “change agent” in the region, and developed a relationship that effectively sidelined Tillerson. According to one former administration official, Kushner’s communications with M.B.S. over the encrypted messaging service WhatsApp were a point of contention within the administration, one that was partly assuaged when Kushner began providing screenshots of his conversations with the National Security Council. But, this person added, “It was still an after-the-fact thing.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In recent days, a number of sources I have spoken with have raised the possibility that M.B.S.’s ties to Kushner may have instilled in the crown prince a belief that America would, indeed, turn a blind eye to the murder of Khashoggi. “I think there is a lot to be said [about how] M.B.S. thought he could get away with it because Jared Kushner was in his pocket, and so was the president for that matter,” the former State Department official who worked in the Middle East said. And after all, the Trump administration has largely ignored the war in Yemen; the strange sojourn of Lebanese Prime Minister &lt;strong&gt;Saad Hariri&lt;/strong&gt; to Saudi Arabia; the ill-fated boycott of Qatar; and M.B.S.’s spats with Canada and Germany. “The Trump administration made it clear that he had a blank check, and so what do you do when you have a blank check? You write in the craziest sum imaginable and take it to the bank, and that is what he did,” Benaim told me. “Only it seems that the blank check has bounced&amp;#8212;at least with Congress, if not with the president.” (The White House did not respond to a request from comment.)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Whether Trump will yield to the pressure from Capitol Hill and the international community, or side with his son-in-law and his buddy, remains an open question. But if evidence indeed shows that M.B.S. was behind the death of Khashoggi, the crown prince will join the ranks of Syrian President &lt;strong&gt;Bashar al-Assad,&lt;/strong&gt; Russian President &lt;strong&gt;Vladimir Putin,&lt;/strong&gt; and North Korean dictator &lt;strong&gt;Kim Jong Un,&lt;/strong&gt; all of whom have engaged in extraterritorial murders to send a clear message to dissidents. Meanwhile, any remaining hope that M.B.S. is the idealist he’s claimed to be has rapidly dissipated. “I think there was legitimate hope when M.B.S. came on the scene that he was going to be a reformer, and he was going to change course,” the congressional aide told me. “And despite initial appearances and words to that effect, it is pretty clear that is not the case.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;","rubric":"Foreign Policy","socialTitle":"“Absolute Disgust”: Diplomats Fume Over Pompeo’s Saudi “Grip and Grin”","socialDescription":"Throughout Washington, people

their lives in the West Wing.","body":"&lt;section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For &lt;strong&gt;Ivanka Trump&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Jared Kushner,&lt;/strong&gt; it was a good week to be out of Washington. Last week, as millions of Americans watched Dr. &lt;strong&gt;Christine Blasey Ford&lt;/strong&gt; and Judge &lt;strong&gt;Brett Kavanaugh&lt;/strong&gt; offer raw testimonies before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Ivanka and Kushner had already made plans to be a couple hundred miles north in New York. Ivanka spent the week sitting for a series of panels and meetings at the United Nations, alongside the president of the World Bank, &lt;strong&gt;Queen Máxima&lt;/strong&gt; of the Netherlands, and Prime Minister &lt;strong&gt;Theresa May.&lt;/strong&gt; Kushner was similarly preoccupied. During the week, he held a round table on prison reform and, on Thursday evening, as the testimony was wrapping up, he met with Israeli Prime Minster &lt;strong&gt;Benjamin Netanyahu.&lt;/strong&gt; Meanwhile, Canadian officials sent him their final notes for a renegotiated version of NAFTA earlier that day. “What Jared provided is a level of credibility that he knows what the president wants,” according to a person familiar with the situation. “They understand he has the ear of the president.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Ever since they arrived in Washington, Ivanka and Kushner have leaned in to their family ties. During one memorable passage in &lt;strong&gt;Bob Woodward’s&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Fear,&lt;/em&gt; Ivanka bristles when &lt;strong&gt;Reince Priebus&lt;/strong&gt; attempts to restrain her influence by giving her the same privileges as other staffers, reminding him that she is &lt;em&gt;the First Daughter.&lt;/em&gt; In an interview with NBC’s &lt;strong&gt;Peter Alexander&lt;/strong&gt; earlier this year, she dodged a question about her father’s alleged sexual misconduct by informing him that it was not appropriate for her to answer. She and Kushner have used the familial sway to varying degrees of efficacy. When the president was mulling whether to pull out of the Paris climate accord, Ivanka and Kushner privately voiced their concerns. Ivanka, in particular, pressed her father to more forcefully condemn the white supremacists who rallied in the streets of Charlottesville, and expressed her distaste for &lt;strong&gt;Roy Moore,&lt;/strong&gt; the Alabama Senate candidate who &lt;strong&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/strong&gt; endorsed after he was accused of assaulting teenage girls when he was in his thirties. More recently, the couple &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/05/keeping-up-with-the-kushners-kim-kardashian-white-house-visit-prison-reform\"&gt;introduced&lt;/a&gt; Trump to &lt;strong&gt;Kim Kardashian,&lt;/strong&gt; as part of Kushner’s prison-reform initiative, leading the president to issue clemency for &lt;strong&gt;Alice Johnson,&lt;/strong&gt; a first-time offender who was serving a life sentence in prison. Most of this advocacy has occurred in private, although it has often found its way to the press.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Last month, shortly after Kavanaugh’s nomination to the Supreme Court was thrown into question on account of sexual misconduct allegations, many observers assumed that Ivanka and Kushner would provide similar counsel. Ivanka, after all, initially came into the White House as an official staffer in order to advocate for women’s issues. But the reality was more complex. In private, according to two people familiar with the situation, Ivanka has aligned herself with the position of her father and &lt;strong&gt;Kellyanne Conway&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#8212;that while Ford deserved to be heard, Kavanaugh seems to be a good man. She has emphasized to her father that his measured response to the allegations, and acceptance of an F.B.I. investigation, had been generally well-received.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But the lack of details surrounding these conversations reflects a fundamental change in both how the West Wing operates, and how the Trump family has adapted to life in the Washington fishbowl. When President Trump first took office, in the initial period of chaos and warring factions, Ivanka and Kushner felt the need to be involved in an outsized number of decisions and meetings. There were few voices they did not believe they should counterbalance. But the Wild West was tamed with the arrival of &lt;strong&gt;John Kelly&lt;/strong&gt; and the departures of &lt;strong&gt;Reince Priebus&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Steve Bannon.&lt;/strong&gt; With a modicum of order in place, Ivanka and Jared took a step back from the Oval Office to manage their own fiefdoms. “If they thought it was necessary to get involved in something, they would,” one person familiar with the situation told me. “But now that he is properly staffed, it frees them up.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This person didn’t rule out the possibility that Ivanka and Kushner are privately offering their opinions to the president on matters of personnel and optics. But, as they have settled into their roles, they have also grasped a profound truth about the way the media covers them. Press reports containing their private advice to the president only provokes more criticism, and often from both sides of the aisle. Trump, too, has recognized that invoking Ivanka doesn’t help either of them. (His remarks that his daughter had urged him to do something about the child-separation crisis at the border sparked days of negative coverage about Ivanka.) “It’s indicative of them getting the way it works now that no one really knows what they’re telling the president on this,” this person told me. “They’ve wisened to it.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ignoring the Kavanaugh drama is just the latest, most pronounced example of how Ivanka (and to a lesser extent Kushner) has reconfigured her relationship to the public, and reset expectations in the process. Ivanka has settled into a routine of meetings on Capitol Hill, event appearances, and visits to schools and job sites to promote female entrepreneurship, STEM education, and workforce development. Kushner has delimited his duties around a handful of bipartisan objectives, including prison reform, the Middle East, and trade. (As the person familiar with the NAFTA negotiations told me, Kushner is already looking for a new way to work with U.S. trade Representative &lt;strong&gt;Robert Lighthizer&lt;/strong&gt; on projects going forward, and is in no rush to get back to New York.)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For the Trump-Kushners, having “wisened” to Washington has meant learning to keep their heads down, compartmentalize, and ignore the constant chaos raging around them. Sure, the Kavanaugh contretemps on Capitol Hill has Democrats and Republicans at each other’s throats, and left many women watching Dr. Ford’s testimony feel gutted. But Ivanka had panels to attend. Kushner met with Netanyahu and plugged away at trade negotiations. Soon after the Senate concluded its tense negotiations over whether there would, in fact, be an F.B.I. investigation into Ford’s claims, Kushner continued to work on the NAFTA deal and Ivanka welcomed a rabbi at the White House to perform some of the customs to celebrate the Jewish holiday Sukkot.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Perhaps this is the survival strategy that gets them through to their post-White House careers, if they do decide to leave Washington. Those hopes have been tested, mostly unsuccessfully, by others who left the administration. Besides &lt;strong&gt;Dina Powell,&lt;/strong&gt; who returned to her old stomping grounds at Goldman Sachs, no other members of the New York contingent have managed a soft landing. &lt;strong&gt;Gary Cohn&lt;/strong&gt; is still without a job, as is &lt;strong&gt;Hope Hicks&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Josh Raffel.&lt;/strong&gt; It is possible that they are merely decompressing and weighing their options. It is also possible that the White House stench doesn’t wash off so easy, at least at the present moment. Whether the same strategy will pay off for Ivanka and Kushner&amp;#8212;two people who cannot wash off the Trump name no matter how much time passes&amp;#8212;depends, of course, on Ivanka’s father. If the special counsel’s office turns up nothing, and the Republicans keep control of Congress, and the economy continues on a tear, well, then they have set themselves up just fine. And if one or all of those things go the other way, it is still possible they could end up O.K. Trump, after all, has demonstrated an uncanny ability to escape political doom without a scratch, only to amass more power in the process. Whether that is hereditary or transferable by marriage will be Ivanka and Jared’s proposition to test.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;","rubric":"First Family","socialTitle":"As the Kavanaugh Drama

","familyName":"Carson","bio":"“I do not see a political path forward,” Dr. Ben Carson said in a statement days before stepping in front of throngs of Republican voters at the Conservative Political Action Conference in National Harbor, Maryland, to officially suspend his 2016 presidential campaign. That Carson or that throng of voters ever saw a political path forward is a curiosity, but, for a brief, shining moment in the midst of a G.O.P. primary referendum-cum-circus, they did.\n&lt;p&gt;Carson, a retired pediatric neurosurgeon who had never sought any elected public office before announcing his candidacy in the spring of 2015, was the first candidate in the crowded Republican field to lead front-runner Donald Trump in the first caucus state of Iowa.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;He was a natural fit for some sort of national stage: born to a single mother with only an elementary-school education, Carson went on to attend Yale and ultimately became the director of pediatric neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins Hospital at the age of 33. He gained some celebrity for his autobiography, &lt;em&gt;Gifted Hands,&lt;/em&gt; which was turned into a made-for-TV movie with Cuba Gooding Jr. He became a star of a different sort when he delivered the keynote speech at the 2013 National Prayer Breakfast and decided to discuss the “mess” President Barack Obama made out of America, comparing it to ancient Rome. Obama happened to be sitting a few feet away. Within hours, days, weeks, Carson became the Tea Party darling&amp;#8212;Rush Limbaugh and Sarah Palin were kissing his ring, Sean Hannity told him he’d vote for him in a heartbeat. He wrote another book, &lt;em&gt;One Nation,&lt;/em&gt; which outsold Hillary Clinton’s &lt;em&gt;Hard Choices.&lt;/em&gt; Fox News once hired him as a political commentator. It was on this national stage that he compared same-sex marriage to bestiality, called Obamacare the worst thing to happen in America since slavery, and explained that modern America was “very much like Nazi Germany.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;None of that discounted him as a presidential candidate; Carson, at times, led masters of the Republican establishment while seemingly asleep. Ultimately, what did him in was his bizarre musings and lack of real fundamental policy knowledge&amp;#8212;as when he asserted that Joseph built the pyramids in Egypt to store grain, or suggested that China had intervened in Syria.&lt;/p&gt;","socialMedia":[],"photos":{"tout":[{"aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":1400,"height":700,"format":"JPEG","url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2016/05/24/5744a9c64f6c70a31f05218b_hive-contributor-profile-ben-carson.jpg"}},"revisionCreatedAt":"May 24, 2016 3:21 pm","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","image":true},"revisionAuthor":"Alyssa Karas","filename":"hive-contributor-profile-ben-carson.jpg","_embedded":{"categories-channels":[],"variantXsmall":[],"variantSmall":[],"variantMedium":[],"variantLarge":[],"variantXlarge":[],"_categories":{}},"title":"hive-contributor-profile-ben-carson.jpg","credit":"By Justin Sullivan/Getty Images.","_links":{},"id":"5744a9c555f979a31fa989bc","createdAt":"May 24, 2016 3:21 pm","revision":2,"modifiedAt":"May 24, 2016 3:21 pm","description":"250: 494744066","contributors":{}}]},"pubDate":"May 25, 2017 11:21 am","url":"/people/ben-carson","mainPhotoContributors":{},"_embedded":{"photosTout":[{"fields":{"aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":1400,"height":700,"format":"JPEG","url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2016/05/24/5744a9c64f6c70a31f05218b_hive-contributor-profile-ben-carson.jpg"}},"revisionCreatedAt":"May 24, 2016 3:21 pm","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","image":true},"revisionAuthor":"Alyssa Karas","filename":"hive-contributor-profile-ben-carson.jpg","_embedded":{"categories-channels":[],"variantXsmall":[],"variantSmall":[],"variantMedium":[],"variantLarge":[],"variantXlarge":[],"_categories":{}},"title":"hive-contributor-profile-ben-carson.jpg","credit":"By Justin Sullivan/Getty Images.","_links":{},"id":"5744a9c555f979a31fa989bc","createdAt":"May 24, 2016 3:21 pm","revision":2,"modifiedAt":"May 24, 2016 3:21 pm","description":"250: 494744066","contributors":{}}}],"contributorsAuthor":[],"contributorsPhotographer":[],"_categories":{},"publishHistory":{"entityId":"573600278e32eeb039377d67","revision":5,"pubDate":"May 25, 2017 11:21 am","revisionAuthor":"Charles Truelson","searchable":true,"expired":false,"createdAt":"May 25, 2017 11:21 am","uri":"people/ben-carson"},"related":[{}]},"relatedItems":{"items":[{"hed":"Ben Carson Is Running HUD Like a Safety School for G.O.P.

And, as it turns out, you would expect correctly!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/ben-carsons-hud-political-loyalty-required-no-experience-necessary/2018/09/20/addb8e74-9b0c-11e8-b60b-1c897f17e185_story.html\"&gt;an investigation&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post,&lt;/em&gt; at least 24 people hired at the agency since &lt;strong&gt;Donald Trump’s&lt;/strong&gt; inauguration have zero housing-policy experience, with 16 seemingly given high-paying positions because they worked on either Trump’s or Carson’s presidential campaigns. Among them, five &lt;em&gt;extra&lt;/em&gt; lucky individuals are political operatives who’ve enjoyed promotions and pay hikes, three of whom “did not list bachelor’s degrees on their résumés.” But what these people lack in relevant experience, they’ve made up for in hamstringing the department’s ability to serve the needs of low-income families:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The lack of experience in a chronically understaffed agency brought even routine work to a halt for much of Carson’s first year at HUD because none of the appointees felt comfortable signing off on grants and technical guidance, according to career staffers.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;“There’s a huge learning curve getting leadership up to the point where they are willing to make a decision on something because they just don’t understand the concepts,” said a longtime career staffer who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of fear of retaliation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In addition to bringing normal functions to a grinding halt, appointees’ lack of experience&amp;#8212;and in some cases, complete contempt for the mission of the agency&amp;#8212;has led to them “pursuing initiatives that aren’t grounded in reality,” according to &lt;strong&gt;Ron Ashford,&lt;/strong&gt; who served as director of HUD’s public-housing supportive-service programs for 22 years. One of those initiatives was a &lt;a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2018/06/08/ben-carson-triple-rents-for-poorest-households-634986\"&gt;proposal&lt;/a&gt; in April to triple the minimum rent paid by the nation‘s poorest families, and to make it easier for housing authorities to enforce stricter work requirements for people receiving government benefits. The plan, according to the &lt;em&gt;Post,&lt;/em&gt; was driven by special policy adviser &lt;strong&gt;Ben Hobbs,&lt;/strong&gt; who has “no experience as a policymaker,” but spent five months studying as a “poverty consultant” at the Charles Koch Institute in 2013. Luckily, Hobbs’s total lack of know-how resulted in HUD backing off the proposal just two months later. “As an ideologue, he wanted to institute his grandiose concept,” said a former HUD official. “This policy was dead on arrival because it was rolled out poorly.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere, a conservative commentator and software developer turned senior adviser to Carson&amp;#8212;who &lt;a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/08/politics/kfile-john-gibbs-hud/index.html\"&gt;spread a conspiracy theory on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;strong&gt;Hillary Clinton’s&lt;/strong&gt; campaign chairman had taken part in a satanic ritual&amp;#8212;is reportedly pulling down a cool $131,767 a year, despite having zero housing experience and a belief that government benefits hurt the poor. In a statement, a spokesman for HUD&amp;#8212;which did not dispute the &lt;em&gt;Post&lt;/em&gt;’s salary findings&amp;#8212;said that appointing people with “varying experiences to government is not unusual” and makes HUD a “more dynamic organization.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you would like to receive the Levin Report in your inbox daily, &lt;a href=\"http://tinyletter.com/besslevin\"&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt; to subscribe.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Las Vegas union tells Gary Cohn to get bent&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;“We don’t know of any workers who destroyed the U.S. economy with fraudulent esoteric credit products,”  &lt;strong&gt;Geoconda Arguello-Kline,&lt;/strong&gt; secretary-treasurer for the union that represents Nevada cocktail and food servers, &lt;a href=\"https://www.reviewjournal.com/business/former-trump-adviser-says-waitress-in-las-vegas-shares-blame-for-recession/\"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;em&gt;Review Journal&lt;/em&gt; after Cohn blamed “waitress in Vegas” for the financial crisis. “But we hope that former and current Wall Street bankers like Mr. Cohn will remember and always be reminded of the great harm they caused to millions of homeowners and workers when they recklessly and irresponsibly sold all sorts of risky financial weapons of mass destruction and fattened their own wallets with fees, commissions, and bonuses while we the taxpayers, bailed out the big banks that were ‘too big to fail.’”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Republicans livid that Americans know exactly who the tax cuts benefited&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Damn you, people! &lt;a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-20/internal-gop-poll-we-ve-lost-the-messaging-battle-on-tax-cuts\"&gt;Damn you to hell&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A survey commissioned by the Republican National Committee has led the party to a glum conclusion regarding President Donald Trump’s signature legislative achievement: Voters overwhelmingly believe his tax overhaul helps the wealthy instead of average Americans.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;By a 2-to-1 margin&amp;#8212;61 percent to 30 percent&amp;#8212;respondents said the law benefits “large corporations and rich Americans” over “middle-class families,” according to the survey, which was completed on September 2 by the G.O.P. firm Public Opinion Strategies and obtained by Bloomberg News.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The study also revealed that Americans worry the tax cuts will result in cuts to Social Security and Medicare, a fear we can’t possibly &lt;a href=\"https://thinkprogress.org/paul-ryan-tax-cuts-medicare-medicaid-f87d810ad5b9/\"&gt;figure out the genesis of&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elsewhere!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The head of the world’s biggest money manager says U.S. stands to lose big long term in the trade war (&lt;a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/20/blackrock-ceo-larry-fink-says-us-stands-to-lose-big-long-term-in-the-trade-war.html\"&gt;CNBC&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Analysts Suspended After Racy Client Party Video Goes Viral (&lt;a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-18/analysts-suspended-after-racy-video-of-client-party-goes-viral\"&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Man Who Hates ETFs Has Found a Way to Save Mutual Funds (&lt;a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-20/the-man-who-hates-etfs-has-found-a-way-to-save-mutual-funds-jmapx0bs\"&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Trump said his tax cuts would bring $5 trillion into the U.S. We have 97 percent to go.

ballpark together. Well, that might be overstating matters slightly. Here’s what we know: They went to the ballpark on Saturday to cheer on the Red Sox against the Dodgers. They were &lt;a href=\"https://people.com/movies/jennifer-garner-ben-affleck-attend-world-series-together/\"&gt;near each other in a private suite&lt;/a&gt;, if not necessarily &lt;em&gt;together&lt;/em&gt; together. Garner chatted with &lt;strong&gt;Angela Bassett,&lt;/strong&gt; actually, and Affleck with a friend. But they were in the same stadium, watching the same baseball, and cheering on the team that played a pivotal role in their early days together.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The sun rose on their relationship at Game 1 of the series against the Cardinals in 2004; it was the first time they were &lt;a href=\"https://people.com/celebrity/star-tracks-oct-25-2004/\"&gt;photographed in public together as a couple&lt;/a&gt;. The Sox went on to win their first World Series since 1918, so, sure, they might have gotten married a year later because they were love and wanted to build a family together, can we absolutely rule out the possibility that the King of Boston (&lt;strong&gt;Marky Mark&lt;/strong&gt;?) mandated they make the relationship official to preserve the team’s streak? We cannot, at least not entirely. It’s kooky what sports fans do for luck.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now, after a decade of marriage, Garner and Affleck have gone their separate ways. &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://people.com/movies/ben-affleck-jennifer-garner-finalize-divorce/\"&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; reported that the pair met with a private judge in early October to finalize their divorce after three years of separation. Both have been rumored to be in new relationships, though for Game 5 of the World Series, Affleck’s &lt;a href=\"https://www.etonline.com/ben-affleck-and-matt-damon-cheer-on-the-boston-red-sox-to-a-world-series-win-112474\"&gt;dates&lt;/a&gt; were none other than fellow son of Boston, &lt;strong&gt;Matt Damon,&lt;/strong&gt; and Dodgers fan &lt;strong&gt;Jimmy Kimmel.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Still, the Red Sox took the series this year, and Ben and Jen were both there for game four. Did Affleck stipulate in their negotiations that she attend one game of the World Series, you know, to help the boys out? It really is kooky what sports fans do for luck. But, no, probably not. She’s just as big a fan as he is. So is this just the way they’ll move forward? Coming together for the children, yes, but also to see the Red Sox through to their finest moments? For the team’s sake&amp;#8212;for &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; our sakes&amp;#8212;let’s hope so.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;More Great Stories from &lt;em&gt;Vanity

Republicans have carved out a wretched existence in Trump’s Washington.","body":"&lt;p&gt;As day turned to dusk on Capitol Hill, and all the cable-news cameras switched off, Nebraska’s &lt;strong&gt;Ben Sasse&lt;/strong&gt; took to the Senate floor Wednesday in a &lt;a href=\"https://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/409818-sasse-trumps-rhetoric-on-ford-wrong-but-not-surprising\"&gt;dramatic appeal to decency&lt;/a&gt;, ostensibly throwing his support behind the #MeToo movement, and bashing &lt;strong&gt;Donald Trump,&lt;/strong&gt; whom he claimed had ignored him when Sasse recommended he nominate a woman to the Supreme Court. “We all know that the president cannot lead us through this time. We know that he’s dispositionally unable to restrain his impulse to divide us,” Sasse said, referring to Trump’s &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/donald-trump-attacks-christine-ford-brett-kavanaugh\"&gt;characteristically cruel attack&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;strong&gt;Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.&lt;/strong&gt; “His mockery of Dr. Ford last night in Mississippi was wrong, but it doesn’t really surprise anyone&amp;#8212;it’s who he is.” At points in his speech, Sasse seemed to be attempting to hold back tears. “It was wrong when people insinuate that a woman bears blame for her sexual assault because she was drunk,” he said, with feeling. “This kind of repugnant nonsense creates excuses for abusers. I don’t want anyone telling those poisonous lies to my daughters.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Of course, impassioned floor speeches are one thing&amp;#8212;actually voting against &lt;strong&gt;Brett Kavanaugh’s&lt;/strong&gt; confirmation is quite another. And when it comes to following through on his woke pronouncements and long-winded pleas for decency, Sasse doesn’t exactly have a stellar track record. Despite an &lt;a href=\"https://www.axios.com/ben-sasse-book-polarization-de0bbc44-1e2a-4458-a794-b0d9d254cea3.html\"&gt;upcoming book&lt;/a&gt; expected to denounce the polarization of the Trump era; a &lt;a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2018/07/09/sasse-trump-republican-senate-never-702071\"&gt;nonprofit&lt;/a&gt; that suggested he would launch a primary challenge to Trump; a speech &lt;a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/02/politics/ben-sasse-donald-trump-criticism-republican-party/index.html\"&gt;slamming Trump&lt;/a&gt; for steel tariffs; and at least one &lt;a href=\"https://www.weeklystandard.com/chris-deaton/ben-sasse-says-he-regularly-considers-leaving-the-republican-party\"&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; professing that he regularly mulls leaving the Republican Party, Sasse votes the Trumpian line about &lt;a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/congress-trump-score/ben-sasse/\"&gt;87 percent&lt;/a&gt; of the time. Even his bold floor speech Wednesday night provided some wiggle room, should he find himself voting to confirm Trump’s SCOTUS pick. “This is not about choosing between believing our daughters and protecting our sons. That choice is false,” Sasse said, adding that the vote should not be considered a “proxy for the validation and validity of claims of sexual violence.” At another point, he said, “My view is that the #MeToo movement is going to make some mistakes, it’s going to have some excesses, but overall it’s been an important and a needed development.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To outside observers, the gesture rang hollow. “He produces very little, but boy, does he have a lot of words,” &lt;a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/opinions/wp/2018/10/04/time-for-undecided-gop-senators-to-put-up-or-hush-up/\"&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt; center-right commentator turned #resistance hero &lt;strong&gt;Jennifer Rubin.&lt;/strong&gt; “Words in tweets, in books and most recently on the floor of the apparently empty Senate chamber well past 9 P.M.,” which reached “no one other than the C-Span camera.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Sasse’s public agonizing is symptomatic of the political no-man’s-land in which moderate Republicans have carved out a wretched existence in Trump’s Washington. He’s joined by the &lt;a href=\"https://www.tampabay.com/opinion/columns/Column-Why-isn-t-Marco-Rubio-braver-_167837345\"&gt;spineless&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Marco Rubio&lt;/strong&gt; (who on Thursday morning &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/marcorubio/status/1047799925948522497\"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; a barely relevant Bible verse rather than outright defend Kavanaugh); the waffling &lt;strong&gt;Bob Corker;&lt;/strong&gt; and the consistently slippery &lt;strong&gt;Jeff Flake.&lt;/strong&gt; Flake, in particular, has made a public show of grappling with the Kavanaugh nomination, briefly halting the vote by calling for a truncated F.B.I. investigation, and later &lt;a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/409608-flake-i-wouldnt-be-troubled-if-fbi-didnt-talk-to-ford\"&gt;telling&lt;/a&gt; reporters that he was “not troubled” by the fact that the bureau did not seek to interview Ford. “I wanted this pause, we’ve had this pause. We’ve had the professionals, the F.B.I., determine&amp;#8212;given the scope that we gave them, current credible allegations&amp;#8212;to go and do their review, which they’ve done,” Flake said on Thursday. “Thus far we’ve seen no new credible corroboration, no new corroboration at all.” &lt;strong&gt;Susan Collins&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Lisa Murkowski&lt;/strong&gt; are not so consistently wishy-washy, but when it comes to Kavanaugh they’re in the same boat as Flake, initially standing firm, but ultimately seeming to &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/mkraju/status/1047868079332646912\"&gt;cave&lt;/a&gt; along the usual party lines.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So, inevitably, will Sasse, a Hamlet Republican too feeble to speak with his vote&amp;#8212;a moderate destined to drown in the era of Trump. “In a very weird way I respect &lt;strong&gt;Lindsey Graham&lt;/strong&gt; more than Ben Sasse,” &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/AdamBlickstein/status/1047661924035559425\"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; former House Intel aide &lt;strong&gt;Adam Blickstein.&lt;/strong&gt; “At least Graham owns the crazy, while Sasse hides behind a very false exterior.”&lt;/p&gt;","rubric":"Kavanaugh","socialTitle":"Ben Sasse’s Tortured Soul Won’t Stop Brett Kavanaugh","socialDescription":"The Nebraska senator’s public

And if Trump is Hitler, you’re gonna sort of have to get rid of him.”","body":"&lt;p&gt;As the polls began to close Tuesday, the president’s most vociferous supporters on the far right began to reckon with the prospect of a fearsome new reality: a Democratic House, empowered to launch ceaseless investigations, subpoena Trump associates, and perhaps even file articles of impeachment. “There may be an attempt to impeach, because the base demands it from the Democrats at this point,” predicted &lt;strong&gt;Ben Shapiro,&lt;/strong&gt; the perpetually consternated editor-in-chief of the Daily Wire. “They’ve been talking about how Trump is Hitler. And if Trump is Hitler, you’re gonna sort of have to get rid of him.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Those fears are hardly unfounded. Since &lt;strong&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/strong&gt; took office, in early 2017, congressional Democrats have called for legislative inquiries into myriad alleged misdeeds. They could, for example, subpoena Trump’s tax returns, extract testimony from people involved in the Russia probe, and initiate dozens of committee investigations&amp;#8212;into White House cyber-security practices, Trump’s firing of U.S. attorneys, alleged political interference at the State Department, &lt;strong&gt;Jared Kushner’s&lt;/strong&gt; dubious ethics-law compliance, the administration’s botched response to Hurricane Maria, and on and on. Impeachment isn’t off the table, either, especially if &lt;strong&gt;Robert Mueller&lt;/strong&gt; gives them reason. When two rogue congressmen attempted to file articles of impeachment last year, &lt;strong&gt;Nancy Pelosi&lt;/strong&gt; and Democratic leadership shot them down, in part to keep their powder dry for this very moment. Now, with the gavel back under Democratic control, the political calculus is much different, even if the wave was not as sweeping as people initially predicted. “It’s still a blue wave, even if not a &lt;em&gt;Point Break&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8211;style wave,” a former senior adviser on the Trump campaign told me. “Losing the House, whether by a large or small margin, is huge.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If the far right is worried about the trouble Democrats may stir up, it is because it is intimately familiar with the damage a vengeful congressional majority can do to punish and obstruct the White House. Rep. &lt;strong&gt;Darrell Issa&lt;/strong&gt; was dogged in his pursuit of the Fast and Furious documents, stretching a minor scandal into a major G.O.P. talking point. Republican-controlled House committees oversaw half a dozen separate investigations into the 2012 Benghazi attack, allowing them to publicly grill &lt;strong&gt;Hillary Clinton&lt;/strong&gt; for more than eight hours. (Rep. &lt;strong&gt;Jason Chaffetz,&lt;/strong&gt; then the Oversight Committee chair, was looking forward to investigating Clinton “&lt;a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/house-republicans-are-already-preparing-for-years-of-investigations-of-clinton/2016/10/26/e153a714-9ac3-11e6-9980-50913d68eacb_story.html?utm_term=.376839192535\"&gt;for years&lt;/a&gt;” over the Benghazi attacks if she won the presidency&amp;#8212;alas.) Whatever restraint Democrats might have exercised in a previous era, there will be no partisan goodwill left in Congress by the time Rep. &lt;strong&gt;Elijah Cummings,&lt;/strong&gt; the ranking Democrat on the Oversight Committee, takes over from Rep. &lt;strong&gt;Trey Gowdy.&lt;/strong&gt; (“I am not looking for headlines,” Cummings &lt;a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/03/us/politics/democrats-trump-impeachment.html\"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; in September. “I am going to be defending the truth. We want to look at what is happening under this administration because all of us can agree this is not normal.”)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The sources I spoke with were particularly concerned with the power Democratic Rep. &lt;strong&gt;Adam Schiff,&lt;/strong&gt; the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, would have if he takes over from current chairman &lt;strong&gt;Devin Nunes.&lt;/strong&gt; ”Instead of D.O.J. facing pressure from Nunes and the Freedom Caucus, they’ll have free rein,” predicted &lt;strong&gt;Jack Posobiec,&lt;/strong&gt; a correspondent from One America News Network and a prominent pro-Trump personality on Twitter. “Schiff will be going door-to-door with free copies of the Mueller report like a Jehovah’s Witness once it’s out.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lee Stranahan,&lt;/strong&gt; the former White House reporter for Breitbart, now a host on Sputnik Radio, suggested that Chairman Schiff could pick up where Mueller leaves off, should the special counsel complete his investigation without indicting the president. A continued, Democratic House-led investigation, he said, “serves a lot of the same political purposes [as Mueller], which is the ‘death by a thousand cuts’ thing.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Even so, MAGA-world downplayed the importance of losing the House, given Republican control of the Senate. Especially since so many of Trump’s policy achievements&amp;#8212;cutting regulations, moving the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem, withdrawing from the Paris climate accord and the Iran nuclear deal&amp;#8212;have circumvented the legislative branch. Conservative judicial nominations, which have already been proceeding at a breakneck pace, will continue unabated. “His agenda will founder a little bit, but do I think there will be anything supremely awful for Trump other than just the investigations? Probably not,” said Shapiro, “unless he was planning any sort of big economic push, but he got his tax cuts through already.” Stranahan added that given Trump’s high-profile failures in that chamber, pushing legislation through the House was a lost cause anyways. “It’s not like Trump had a tremendous amount of success with stuff that went through the House apart from the tax thing.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ali Alexander,&lt;/strong&gt; a pro-Trump activist and media celebrity with &lt;a href=\"https://observer.com/2018/10/robert-mercer-bankrolled-pac-ali-alexander/\"&gt;ties&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;strong&gt;Bob Mercer,&lt;/strong&gt; was even less worried, predicting that losing the House might even be a &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; thing for Trump’s chances in 2020. “You’ll have someone to run against,” he explained, noting that the president thrives when he has an established order to smash. Plus, he added, just as Republicans took hard votes on repealing Obamacare, now Democrats would be the ones in the uncomfortable position of having to make politically difficult, and strategically fraught, legislative decisions leading into the next election cycle. “Every Democrat running against him is going to have to take a position on every bill the House considers.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"&gt;&lt;blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/bethanyshondark/status/1060018223435915266\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/bethanyshondark/status/1060018223435915266\"&gt;https://twitter.com/bethanyshondark/status/1060018223435915266&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;And yet, there was a palpable sense of fear that, after two years of wild, Trumpian abandon in Washington, the party might be drawing to an end&amp;#8212;with real legal consequences for anyone who might have broken the rules along the way. Everyone I spoke to expressed worry that other Trump associates would soon be swept up in a super-charged Russia witch hunt. The chief target, according to these people: &lt;strong&gt;Donald Trump Jr.,&lt;/strong&gt; the president’s son and MAGA idol, who took an infamous 2016 meeting with a Kremlin-connected Russian lawyer peddling “dirt” on Clinton. “Schiff wants to fuck Jr.,” said Alexander, suggesting that Donny could soon become a prime target of a Democratic-controlled House Intelligence Committee. Posobiec also offered up another name&amp;#8212;&lt;strong&gt;Roger Stone&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#8212;though he didn’t expect the inquisition would end there. “Me, &lt;strong&gt;Mike Cernovich,&lt;/strong&gt; and Roger Stone can rent a townhouse across from the House Intel Committee and take turns walking over to explain how we had no connections to &lt;strong&gt;[Vladimir] Putin.&lt;/strong&gt;’”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;More Great Stories from &lt;em&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212; Pope vs. Pope: the &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/pope-francis-benedict-conflict-catholic-church?mbid=inline\"&gt;Catholic Church’s civil war&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212; Michael Cohen reveals details about &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/11/michael-cohen-trump-racist-language?mbid=inline\"&gt;Trump’s private racism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212; How MSNBC turned cable news &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/11/how-msnbc-created-a-cable-news-addiction-epidemic?mbid=inline\"&gt;into an addiction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212; Inside the &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/jacob-wohl-robert-mueller-sexual-assault-allegations?mbid=inline\"&gt;fake MAGA intelligence company&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212; Trump’s hapless workday, &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/trump-schedule-executive-time?mbid=inline\"&gt;by the hour&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Looking for more? &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/newsletters\"&gt;Sign up&lt;/a&gt; for our daily Hive newsletter and never miss a story.&lt;/p&gt;","rubric":"2018 Midterm Elections","socialTitle":"“They’ll Have Free Rein”: As Democrats Seize the House, MAGA-Land Predicts Impeachment","socialDescription":"“The base demands it,” says Ben Shapiro. “They’ve been talking about how Trump is Hitler.

Gallery&lt;/em&gt;. Why this play?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It’s an autobiographical play that Kenny wrote about the end of his\ngrandmother’s life. I get to act alongside Elaine May, Joan Allen, and\nMichael Cera. It’s a great group of people, and it’s a meditation on\nwhat it means to lose a person. Most everyone has a grandparent or a\nparent whose mind is going in some way, and it’s a really, really\nspecial play.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kenneth Lonergan directed you in &lt;em&gt;Manchester by the Sea,&lt;/em&gt; which landed you\nan Oscar nomination. Has there been a reunion?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I was with him for a few weeks of rehearsal, which was very nice. I feel\nlike I’ve grown up, but when I saw Kenny, I was like, Oh, I’m not a man.\nI’m just like I was then, a little kid.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You and Timothée Chalamet co-starred in &lt;em&gt;Lady Bird&lt;/em&gt; and were nominated for\nOscars a year apart. How are you two New Yorkers handling Hollywood?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;He popped onto my radar when he did &lt;em&gt;Interstellar,&lt;/em&gt; because that was the\npart I auditioned for. Then I think I popped onto his radar when I got\n&lt;em&gt;Manchester,&lt;/em&gt; and then there were some parts that we sort of traded off\non. But we do share a bond of two kids from New York City who kind of&amp;#8212;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shot out of a cannon&amp;#8212;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Ben Is Back,&lt;/em&gt; you’re directed by your father, Peter Hedges. Your\nco-star Julia Roberts told me that you would only call him by his first\nname on set.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"callout large\" data-type=\"callout\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At first, I didn’t see acting as an opportunity to be of service. That\ncame later.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I called him Pete. Working with my dad was intense because\nwhenever he would give me a note it brought me back to when I was in\ntrouble as a kid. It required us to be grown-ups&amp;#8212;it wasn’t dad and\nson; it was more director and actor. But I feel like we made a good\nmovie, so that’s what I’m proud of.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The film wrestles with addiction and the opioid crisis. What was your\npoint of entry for playing a recovering drug addict?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Addiction is a very big thing in my family, particularly on my father’s\nside, and it feels like something that was passed on to me&amp;#8212;not with a\nsubstance but with respect to validation and approval. I will sell\nmyself at any cost to be liked. It’s really true. There’s something that\nlives inside of me that is the same as any other addiction.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And in &lt;em&gt;Boy Erased,&lt;/em&gt; your character also battles with self-discovery, as a\nteenager sent to gay-conversion therapy. What drew you to the role?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I really identified with the character’s mind. I felt like the book it’s\nbased on was a blueprint for his inner life, and I’d never been given\nthe keys to the kingdom in that respect as an actor. And I wanted to be\na part of a movie in which there was an immediate sense of a higher\npower or a greater purpose.

While on a press tour for the film &lt;em&gt;The Old Man &amp;amp; the Gun,&lt;/em&gt; Casey told &lt;a href=\"https://www.etonline.com/casey-affleck-on-how-jennifer-garner-and-kids-have-inspired-ben-to-get-sober-exclusive-109727\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Entertainment Tonight&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, “I’m not sure what there is to say,” before finding his words: “We come from a long line of alcoholics. Ben is an addict and an alcoholic. Most of my grandparents are alcoholics. My father is an alcoholic, as bad as you can be, and he’s been sober for about 30 years. I’ve been sober for about six years.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;“Ben is trying to put it together, and it can be a very hard thing to do. He has the kind of resources and time, luckily, to take the time and to go to a good facility,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Paparazzi have photographed the elder Affleck going to and from a rehab center this past month, including a photo of Garner taking Affleck through a &lt;a href=\"http://www.tmz.com/2018/08/22/ben-affleck-going-to-rehab-after-intervention-by-jen-garner/\"&gt;drive-through at Jack in the Box&lt;/a&gt; before dropping him off at the facility. “It can’t be easier to have everybody looking at you and taking your picture as you’re, like, walking out of an intervention,” Casey added. “I don’t envy that. I saw my father struggle with it for many years, and nobody was following him around with cameras and stuff. It’s not a great look. But on the other hand, it’s nothing to be ashamed of, and it’s good that he’s taking care of it.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The family is admirably open about their struggles with substance abuse. The two Afflecks have spoken about the road to sobriety for themselves, but it’s an interesting choice for the younger Affleck to comment so thoroughly on his brother’s addiction. The actor’s own demons and alleged actions under its influence are still fresh. &lt;a href=\"https://www.apnews.com/e50db6e255364f7da01412a6734a3685\"&gt;Very, very fresh.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It’s also rare to get such a candid, direct response about an issue with such high stakes. In Garner’s case, for example, statements about how she “wants nothing more than for Ben to dedicate himself to his sobriety” were delivered through &lt;a href=\"https://www.etonline.com/how-ben-afflecks-relationship-with-shauna-sexton-is-affecting-him-in-rehab-exclusive-109687\"&gt;unnamed sources&lt;/a&gt;, rather than coming directly from Jen. She, too, was promoting a new film, but it never came up for whatever reason.&lt;/p&gt;","rubric":"Interviews","socialTitle":"Casey Affleck Got Candid About Ben Affleck’s

And, so more than ever, Trump remains the network’s main programmer.","body":"&lt;p&gt;Shortly before Fox News C.E.O. Roger Ailes was fired, in July 2016, after dozens of women accused him of sexual harassment, he delivered a warning to his boss, Rupert Murdoch. “Trump gets great ratings, but if you’re not careful, he is going to end up totally controlling Fox News,” Ailes said, a source briefed on the conversation recently recalled. “Roger was highly annoyed with Trump. He couldn’t contain him at all,” a high-level Fox staffer remembered.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But now there’s a new boss in charge&amp;#8212;sort of. His name is Lachlan Murdoch. In May, Rupert named Lachlan, his elder son, chairman and C.E.O. of “New Fox,” the slimmed-down parent company that will emerge out of the Murdochs’ $71 billion deal to sell most of their entertainment assets to Disney. Lachlan, 47, is the heir that Rupert most wanted to succeed him even though, of the candidates in the family, Lachlan seemed to want the job least. He’s never been a political junkie like his father, an overt careerist like younger brother James, or a rebellious entrepreneur like older sister Liz. In 2005, Lachlan famously walked away from the company after clashing with Ailes and former C.O.O. Peter Chernin and moved back to the family’s native Australia.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Having returned to the fold, Lachlan has so far been content to be a caretaker rather than an empire builder. Although his nameplate was installed on an office at Fox News several months ago, Lachlan, who ran the &lt;em&gt;New York Post&lt;/em&gt; in the 1990s, mostly is an absentee manager, choosing instead to work from the company’s Los Angeles office. When he occasionally drops in on Fox’s morning editorial meeting, he doesn’t cut a big presence. “He’s polite and asks questions about the news. He’s respectful and comes off as someone trying to learn,” one attendee said. In fact, Lachlan’s highest-profile decision was to hire Donald Trump’s former communications director, Hope Hicks, to be New Fox’s spokesperson. He didn’t know Hicks well&amp;#8212;they had met only a handful of times&amp;#8212;but he was encouraged by Trump and Jared Kushner to hire her. “It seems like he was doing Trump a favor,” one Fox journalist said.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;With Lachlan content to let the Fox News machine run, the hand on the wheel belongs to Fox News C.E.O. Suzanne Scott. Scott’s management style is to effectively let the network’s producers run their shows independently. “No one is in charge,” a former executive told me. Without clear direction from the top, it’s every man for himself.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Fox’s hugely successful alliance with Trump has amplified divisions and rivalries among Fox’s on-air talent. Shepard Smith has emerged as the network’s most visible capital-&lt;em&gt;J&lt;/em&gt;  journalist and quasi-ombudsman. He’s used his three P.M. newscast to debunk Trump conspiracies, like the Uranium One obsession, and give airtime to investigative stories such as &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;’s 14,000-word exposé on Trump’s alleged tax dodging. Sean Hannity has called Smith “clueless” and “so anti-Trump.” At Mar-a-Lago in April, Hannity was overheard trashing Smith to Trump, according to one person familiar with the conversation. “Hannity was denouncing Shep, and Trump was eating it up.” (Hannity denied making the remarks.) Behind the scenes, Smith has taken on a bigger role in shaping Fox’s news coverage and critiques stories he doesn’t like, something that’s rankled some executives. “He’s the one who’s power hungry. He’s trying to pull the place left,” one former executive said. (A Fox News spokesperson disputes this.) Access to Trump also stokes jealousies among hosts. Sources say business anchor Neil Cavuto has complained to colleagues about Lou Dobbs’s closeness with the president. (A Fox News spokesperson says this is “not true.”)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"callout small\" data-type=\"callout\"&gt;&lt;div class=\"embed image row\"&gt;&lt;figure class=\"embedded-image\" data-type=\"image\"&gt;&lt;div class=\"pinterest-link-container\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5bd2305d005a606878515eec/master/h_450,c_limit/cable-news-sherman-dec-2018-embed01.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-pin-desc=\"\" data-pin-credits=\"\"/&gt;&lt;a class=\"pinterest-link\" href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vanityfair.com%2Fnews%2F2018%2F10%2Finside-trumps-new-fox-takeover&amp;amp;media=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.vanityfair.com%2Fphotos%2F5bd2305d005a606878515eec%2Fmaster%2Fh_450%2Cc_limit%2Fcable-news-sherman-dec-2018-embed01.png&amp;amp;description=\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump’s dominance of Fox is partly an accident, as a result of the lack of strong internal leadership. And, of course, in ratings terms, it’s been a happy accident. But the outcome is precisely the one Ailes had warned against: the network’s identity is now inseparable from that of the president, a development that would have surely horrified Ailes. Ailes may have been a right-winger, but he was sophisticated enough to know that Fox needed enough plausible distance from the subjects it covers to maintain the fiction of being “Fair &amp;amp; Balanced.” Now Fox is effectively an arm of the White House. Trump derives “policy” ideas from segments he likes and counts Sean Hannity as one of his closest advisers. The administration can feel like a Fox greenroom on a heavy news day. John Bolton serves as Trump’s national-security adviser; former Fox contributor Ben Carson runs HUD; former &lt;em&gt;Fox &amp;amp; Friends&lt;/em&gt; newsreader Heather Nauert serves as State Department spokesperson; and former Fox president Bill Shine is deputy chief of staff for communications. (Hannity lobbied for him to get the job.) Fox military analyst General Jack Keane has been discussed inside the West Wing as a successor to Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, a former White House official said. One Fox personality literally got into bed with the Trumps: former &lt;em&gt;The Five&lt;/em&gt; co-host Kimberly Guilfoyle is dating Don junior.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For hosts and producers, it’s a strange, though not entirely unfamiliar, environment. Fox hosts regularly get calls from Trump about segments he likes&amp;#8212;or doesn’t. “When you worked at Fox, you knew that at any moment Roger Ailes was watching. Every day was like a job interview with Ailes. Now it’s the same way for Trump,” says a veteran Fox News contributor. According to sources, Trump doesn’t explicitly dictate talking points the way Ailes did, but over time the effect can be similar. “What he usually does is he’ll call after a show and say, ‘I really enjoyed that,’” a former Fox anchor told me. “The highest compliment is ‘I really learned something.’ Then you know he got a new policy idea.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The fact that the news staff knows Trump always could be tuning in means the network is being programmed for an audience of one. “He has the same embattled view as a typical Fox viewer&amp;#8212;that ‘the liberal elites hate me; they’re trying to bring me down,’ ” the former executive said. At times, anchors will use Fox segments to send messages directly to Trump. The day &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reported Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein discussed tape-recording Trump to rally support amongst the Cabinet to invoke the 25th Amendment, Hannity told Trump the article was a trap to bait him into firing Rosenstein.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"callout small\" data-type=\"callout\"&gt;&lt;div class=\"embed image row\"&gt;&lt;figure class=\"embedded-image\" data-type=\"image\"&gt;&lt;div class=\"pinterest-link-container\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5bd2305a7473bd560f08b0ca/master/h_450,c_limit/cable-news-sherman-dec-2018-embed02.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-pin-desc=\"\" data-pin-credits=\"\"/&gt;&lt;a class=\"pinterest-link\" href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vanityfair.com%2Fnews%2F2018%2F10%2Finside-trumps-new-fox-takeover&amp;amp;media=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.vanityfair.com%2Fphotos%2F5bd2305a7473bd560f08b0ca%2Fmaster%2Fh_450%2Cc_limit%2Fcable-news-sherman-dec-2018-embed02.jpg&amp;amp;description=\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"caption callout-image-caption\"&gt;&lt;div class=\"wrapper\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"credits\"&gt;Photo by Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty Images.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rupert Murdoch’s relationship with Trump, and his network’s importance in maintaining the protective bubble of propaganda around the president, is one of some irony. Murdoch has wanted a personal relationship with an American president ever since he decamped from London to New York, in the 1970s (he was not particularly close with George W. Bush, the last Republican to hold the office). With Trump, he’s achieved that goal&amp;#8212;though he has told friends he thinks Trump is a “buffoon” and his strongest personal allegiances (much like Trump’s, actually) are to the elites that Trump uses as his whipping boys. But Murdoch prizes profits above ideology, so he accommodated Trump in order to preserve access. Before the inauguration, I reported that Trump asked Murdoch to submit names for the position of F.C.C. commissioner. (Murdoch denied it at the time.)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The question for Lachlan going forward is the same one that has vexed the Republican Party in the age of Trump: when to break from Trump, if a divorce is even possible. At moments there have been frays in the bond, as when Trump doted on Vladimir Putin in Helsinki (Neil Cavuto called it “disgusting”) or attacked Brett Kavanaugh’s accuser Dr. Christine Blasey Ford (a &lt;em&gt;Fox &amp;amp; Friends&lt;/em&gt; host said Trump “chose to blow it”). This fall, panic swept through Fox’s executive ranks as it looked like Democrats had a chance to retake both the House and the Senate. “They are deathly afraid of the Dems taking the House,” one high-level staffer said. The fear, according to the staffer, is that congressional committees investigating the Trump White House could draw in Fox. “Fox is hiring lobbyists to prepare,” the staffer said. Ominously for both Fox and the president, Trump’s rallies are not drawing the numbers they once did. As Politico reported, a Trump rally on August 30, carried live in Tucker Carlson’s regular prime-time slot, drew only 2.5 million viewers, whereas Carlson had been averaging more than 2.8 million. More recently, as Trump has been barnstorming ahead of the midterms, Fox has only been dipping into his rallies.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But mostly, Fox doesn’t have much of a choice when it comes to Trump. And why not? On the day Kavanaugh shouted his way through his Senate Judiciary Committee testimony, Fox attracted a near-record 5.7 million viewers&amp;#8212;more than MSNBC and CNN combined.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;More from our Special Report on the State of Cable News:&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212; How MSNBC gamified &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/11/how-msnbc-created-a-cable-news-addiction-epidemic\"&gt;cable news into addiction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212; Inside CNN’s massive &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/11/inside-the-trump-gold-rush-at-cnn\"&gt;Trump gold rush&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"embed cneembed\"&gt;&lt;div class=\"embed block cneembed\" data-url=\"//player.cnevids.com/script/video/5bbe9f3a625710412d00003b.js?muted=1\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;","rubric":"From the Magazine","socialTitle":"“No One Is in Charge”: Inside Trump’s New Fox Takeover","socialDescription":"Lachlan Murdoch, now installed at Fox News, is a caretaker rather than an empire builder.

The meeting took place mere hours before the alleged rape. Weinstein has long denied all accusations of nonconsensual acts, from Thompson and the dozens of other women accusing him of assault and harassment.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The video, which was &lt;a href=\"https://news.sky.com/video/harvey-weinstein-so-am-i-allowed-to-flirt-with-you-11496162\"&gt;aired&lt;/a&gt; by Sky News on Wednesday night and is accompanied by an interview with Thompson, shows her meeting with the producer, whom she had informally met once before. Thompson had come to the Weinstein Company offices in New York to demonstrate her tech start-up’s video and analytics service. She recorded their meeting as part of the demonstration. At the start of the meeting, Weinstein instructs his staff not to interrupt them, then locks the door. When Thompson reaches out to shake his hand, he reaches in for a hug and rubs her back.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;“I was sensing I have to be a little more vigilant of this situation than I originally thought,” Thompson said in the interview with Sky News.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As she began her presentation, Weinstein can be heard asking, “So am I allowed to flirt with you?”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;“Um, we’ll see. A little bit,” Thompson responded. Weinstein then backed down.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In the Sky News interview, Thompson recalled thinking at the time that she should try volleying with him, following his lead to “manage the situation.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;“There was a combination of confidence and naiveté that led me to this dynamic that we see now,” she said. In the footage, Thompson makes flirtatious remarks, at one point joking to Weinstein, “Data’s so hot, right?”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;“It is hot. You’re hot. Let me have a little bit of you. Give it to me,” Weinstein responded. According to Thompson, he then reached out and ran his hand up her leg under her dress. It is not visible in the video, but Thompson can be seen telling Weinstein, “That’s a little high.” Weinstein can then be seen rubbing Thompson’s arm as she continues with the demonstration. In the Sky News interview, Thompson responded to those who might say she was flirting with Weinstein and encouraging his behavior by saying that the situation was more complicated than that.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;“I worked on Wall Street before I went to business school, and I worked in an environment that was heavily male dominated,” she said. “I thought I could handle it. I had never met anyone that I couldn’t handle until Harvey Weinstein.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;When she re-watches the footage now, she claims she can see Weinstein attempting to “move me into that zone of comfortable, then uncomfortable and confused and vulnerable, and recognizing that he’s powerful and I’m not, and that I need this deal from him, and he has the power to give it to me . . . I think [he] was playing a cat-and-mouse game from the very beginning to see how far he could push me, and what my reactions might be, so that he could gauge . . . how he would play me, where my levers where, what were my vulnerabilities.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;After the meeting came to a close, Weinstein arranged for Thompson to meet him in the lobby of the Tribeca Grand Hotel later that day. Thompson told Sky she was under the impression that they were meeting to close the deal. When she arrived at the hotel, Weinstein allegedly instructed her to follow him. He guided her to his hotel room. It was then that he raped her, Thompson alleged.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;“If I would try to fight myself away from him, he would then move around to a place where he could block me in,” she said. “I constantly felt trapped, no matter where I turned. He cornered me, over and over again.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Thompson came forward as an accuser in June, filing a class-action lawsuit against Weinstein with two other women. In the suit, she also claimed that she &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/06/harvey-weinstein-rape-charges-not-guilty-plea-court\"&gt;initially sought help&lt;/a&gt; from attorney &lt;strong&gt;Benjamin Brafman,&lt;/strong&gt; sharing alleged video evidence for her case with him. She did not realize at the time that his firm was representing Weinstein. Brafman denied her allegations against him. Thompson has since met with the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office. Weinstein is currently embroiled in another legal battle with the D.A.’s office, and has been indicted on a handful of sex-crime charges. Since last October, more than 80 women have accused him of sexual misconduct. He has denied all allegations of nonconsensual acts.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/world-exclusive-video-shows-harvey-weinstein-behaving-inappropriately-with-businesswoman-11496038\"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; to Sky News, Brafman called Thompson’s video an attempt to make Weinstein appear “exploitative.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;“Several respected journalists and trustworthy individuals have seen the entire video,” he said. “What they shared with us is that the video, when viewed in its entirety, in context and not in select excerpts, demonstrates that there is nothing forceful, but casual&amp;#8212;if not awkward&amp;#8212;flirting from both parties. Anything short of that is intended to make Mr. Weinstein appear inappropriate, and even exploitative. It was produced by Ms. Thompson to bolster her position in a civil lawsuit seeking money. This is a further attempt to publicly disgrace Mr. Weinstein for financial gain, and we will not stand for it. Facts do matter.”&lt;/p&gt;","rubric":"the allegations","socialTitle":"Weinstein Accuser Shares Video of Producer Pursuing, Touching Her Inappropriately","socialDescription":"Melissa Thompson, who has

Well, for one thing, it’s hard for anyone to even agree on whether they’re any good.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;On this week’s &lt;em&gt;Little Gold Men&lt;/em&gt; podcast, &lt;em&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/em&gt;’s HWD editor, &lt;strong&gt;Hillary Busis,&lt;/strong&gt; stops in for a discussion of both &lt;em&gt;Suspiria&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Bohemian Rhapsody,&lt;/em&gt; both of which are baffling and intriguing for very different reasons.

Either way, Wednesday’s installment surely ranks in the Hall of Fame. The long-awaited installment delivered not only the inspired, if brief, returns of &lt;strong&gt;Jessica Lange, Connie Britton,&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Dylan McDermott,&lt;/strong&gt; but also offered satisfying conclusions for multiple story threads that have been dangling for seven years, ever since &lt;em&gt;Murder House&lt;/em&gt; ended. The only hitch: &lt;strong&gt;Zachary Quinto&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Teddy Sears&lt;/strong&gt; did not return to play bickering Chad and Patrick.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The premise of the episode was deceptively simple: Madison (&lt;strong&gt;Emma Roberts&lt;/strong&gt;) and Chablis (&lt;strong&gt;Billy Porter&lt;/strong&gt;) bought the Murder House to investigate Michael Langdon’s past, and spent most of it interrogating the ghosts lurking inside. The Cliff Notes version goes something like this: Michael was a terror from the time he was a toddler, killing animals and, eventually, people. Even his presumed father, serial killer and rapist Tate Langdon (&lt;strong&gt;Evan Peters&lt;/strong&gt;) claims that he could not have produced such a monstrous heir as Michael. Still, Constance (Lange), convinced she was destined to be a mother to all the world’s monsters, tried her best to raise Michael. She eventually realized that he was a lost cause&amp;#8212;and so she killed herself to spend eternity with the ghosts of her children.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Ben Harmon (McDermott), a therapist, tried to set Michael on a better path as well, but like Constance, he gave up. As Vivien Harmon (Britton) told Madison and Chablis, Michael was beyond help; he is the Antichrist. Eventually, three members of the Church of Satan, including &lt;strong&gt;Kathy Bates’s&lt;/strong&gt; Ms. Mead, arrived, performing a dark ceremony in which they ripped a kidnapped girl’s heart out while she was still alive. Michael, of course, ate the heart&amp;#8212;and that, it seems, is how he ended up living with Ms. Mead.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As juicy as all of these reveals were, it was the order and manner of Madison and Chablis’s discoveries that made the episode so rewarding. &lt;strong&gt;Sarah Paulson&lt;/strong&gt; directed it, and although it’s packed with information&amp;#8212;she shot &lt;a href=\"https://variety.com/2018/tv/features/american-horror-story-apocalypse-sarah-paulson-directing-interview-1202981441/\"&gt;72 scenes&lt;/a&gt; in total&amp;#8212;the episode never lost its sense of pace and tension. It’s hard to imagine a greater moment than Jessica Lange introducing herself by saying, from the top of a staircase, “I’m Constance Langdon, and this is my fucking house!” But the most satisfying moments this week were actually gentler.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A highlight, for instance, was Moira’s escape from the Murder House to reunite with her mother. Madison, apparently softened by a quick stay in hell, was the one who dug up Moira’s bones and buried them in her mother’s grave so that the two could reunite and find peace&amp;#8212;plus, it didn’t hurt that Constance said she would only tell the witches about Michael if they got her nemesis out of the house. Either way, Moira’s happy ending was a satisfying conclusion for a character who has been stuck in an undeserved purgatory for decades.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And then there were Tate and Violet. Since the &lt;em&gt;Murder House&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Coven&lt;/em&gt; crossover was announced, one prevailing question has been how, exactly, the series would handle Tate Langdon&amp;#8212;a school-shooter character who, given all of the mass shootings in recent years, might not seem as sympathetic as he once did. Tate’s position within &lt;em&gt;Murder House&lt;/em&gt; as the romantic hero did not help things. This week’s installment did some work to assuage any guilt fans might feel about rooting for Tate and Violet: Madison told Violet that the house’s evil is what infected Tate and made him do all kinds of horrible things. The evil left with Michael, she said, leaving only the good Tate. (Vivien also said that Michael is a product of the darkness in the house.) All of this paved the way for the teenage lovers to reconcile, but it also felt a little forced.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And while most lingering mysteries surrounding both Michael and the Murder House were answered this week, a few threads are still dangling. The first is Madison’s connection to both the Murder House and Nora and Charles Montgomery. When Paulson’s medium character, Billie Dean Howard, showed up at the Murder House to greet Madison and Chablis, she indicated that Madison is related to the couple that first owned the Murder House&amp;#8212;but the connection was left otherwise unexplained. It also might have been nice to hear a little more about Constance’s mysterious fourth child, who until this week had never been seen&amp;#8212;a little girl with blonde hair and no eyes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And then there’s the mother of all mysteries: will Vivien and Ben Harmon ever reunite, or is Ben cursed to “tearjerk” while staring out a window for the rest of eternity? For the sake of everyone involved, we’re really praying for a happy ending.&lt;/p&gt;","rubric":"the horror, the horror!","socialTitle":"A.H.S.: Apocalypse’s Return to Murder House Was Shameless Fan

difficult to gauge right now. Particularly timeliness of the insistent, clever, political kind&amp;#8212;the Twin Towers pale in the background at the end of &lt;em&gt;Munich,&lt;/em&gt; say. Because we live in such a specifically clobbering moment, messy and absurd and dreadful&amp;#8212;and, most detrimental to timeliness, unique in its flouting of order, of the rules and mores than can connect past to present.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So you’ll forgive &lt;em&gt;The Front Runner,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Jason Reitman’s&lt;/strong&gt; new political period piece opening ominously (hubristically?) on midterm Election Day, if it maybe seems small and ineffectual in its attempts to yoke the story of 1980s presidential candidate &lt;strong&gt;Gary Hart&lt;/strong&gt; to the current beast raging around Washington. Maybe there’s a tidier alternate present day in which we might look at the story of Hart&amp;#8212;taken down by media coverage of an extramarital affair, just as he was aimed square at the White House&amp;#8212;and say, “Ah yes, past is prologue, this is how we got here.” But in this grim reality, &lt;em&gt;The Front Runner&lt;/em&gt; feels quaint, almost a hopeful thing, crafted in the old ways with a pitiable naïveté.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;That said, it’s an engaging and well-acted movie, telling a tale of stubborn pride and compromised scruples with weary humor. Hart, a Colorado senator, was the great Democratic hope for 1988, a handsome no-nonsense type who had a radically unadorned approach to politics. He was so practical, in fact, that he and his wife, &lt;strong&gt;Lee,&lt;/strong&gt; had an understanding of sorts about infidelity. That was not something the people of the day, nor our day, were really willing to accept (nor was Hart really willing to admit it), so when an affair with a pharmaceutical rep named &lt;strong&gt;Donna Rice&lt;/strong&gt; came to light, his campaign was fatally derailed.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Front Runner&lt;/em&gt; details the process of all that, from the &lt;em&gt;Miami Herald&lt;/em&gt; reporters who broke the story, going so far as to do a stakeout of Hart’s D.C. townhouse, to the campaign staff scrambling to get Hart to realize the thing for the catastrophe it was. Reitman, who co-wrote the script with &lt;strong&gt;Matt Bai&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Jay Carson,&lt;/strong&gt; lays the film out in Altman-esque fashion, lots of overlapping dialogue delivered by credibly shaggy people, a docu-realism cut through by dry irony. It’s a pleasant movie about an unpleasant collapse, both of one man’s ambitions and of institutional proprieties.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If the film is a little confused on the institutional part, that’s more of an asset than a flaw. It’s a confusing topic! On one hand, it’s frustrating, maybe even silly, that consensual sex still carries such disproportionate weight in the American moral imagination, and that a newspaper should exploit that for a diverting scoop. On the other hand, a deferential relationship between press and politician has proven to be a dangerous thing over the years. I’d rather have a few politicians outed as philanderers than a press corps totally compromised by an arrangement of convenience masking itself as ethics.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The peril of access journalism is still a needling issue today, so &lt;em&gt;The Front Runner&lt;/em&gt; is not about the end of any coziness. Instead it chews on its ambivalence. The film is more on Hart’s side than on the &lt;em&gt;Miami Herald&lt;/em&gt;’s, certainly, but Reitman hasn’t made a screed. &lt;em&gt;The Front Runner&lt;/em&gt;’s feeling of resignation about the state of the media, the sigh of the movie, is matched by a careful and none too flattering portrait of Hart’s mulish vanity.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;He’s played by &lt;strong&gt;Hugh Jackman,&lt;/strong&gt; a great showman here dampening his glow. It’s nice to see him doing something that’s detailed and particulate. He gets one shouty climactic scene, something for the trailer, but mostly reins himself in. It’s a chilly performance, which is an entirely new temperature for the actor. (His Wolverine is all gruffness masking huggable warmth, after all.) Jackman’s recessive, observed work understands the jarring contrast of a guy like this, so stern and upright, being caught on a boat called “Monkey Business.” In Jackman’s hands, the contradictions of Hart begin to feel like some benign-ish example of the contradictions of so many in politics, poses of selflessness and principle clashing awkwardly with the proclivities of private human life.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Jackman has a strong support team. &lt;strong&gt;Vera Farmiga&lt;/strong&gt; plays Lee with her usual calm command. &lt;strong&gt;J.K. Simmons, Alex Karpovsky, Ari Graynor,&lt;/strong&gt; and a terrific &lt;strong&gt;Molly Ephraim&lt;/strong&gt; are among the campaign staffers and journalists wrestling over Hart’s legacy. Ephraim has an especially good, and sad, couple of scenes with an effective &lt;strong&gt;Sara Paxton,&lt;/strong&gt; who plays Donna Rice. It’s a relief that this film, largely about a man doing damage control, stops at least for a little bit to consider the woman implicated in it all.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose the argument to be made for the film’s timeliness is that the Hart situation is what gradually inured us to the point that a presidential candidate who admits to sexually assaulting women could still win. That in first trading in cheap titillation and moral outrage, we set ourselves on the course toward indifference. In the age that we’re in, though, it’s hard to stomach an even mild suggestion that it was a better day when the secret lives of powerful men were safely protected by a system of discretion.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In order to assert its true strength, &lt;em&gt;The Front Runner&lt;/em&gt; asks that we do the requisite thought experiment, gaming out the course of the American narrative had Gary Hart become president. Maybe then no &lt;strong&gt;Bill Clinton,&lt;/strong&gt; so no &lt;strong&gt;Hillary,&lt;/strong&gt; either. Or maybe them, just at a different time. Does &lt;strong&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/strong&gt; still come into play? And if not him, does &lt;strong&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/strong&gt; ever appear? What purpose has public prurience&amp;#8212;so vexing to &lt;em&gt;The Front Runner&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8212;come to serve in a world with no pee tape?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;That’s fun and glum stuff to think about. But a bus crash could just as easily have destroyed that imaginary time line as Hart’s sex scandal did. Which makes &lt;em&gt;The Front Runner&lt;/em&gt; feel less consequential than it wants to. Reitman has still made an interesting film. It’s just that, from this vantage point, everyone in it seems snared in such obvious entropy. Maybe that’s the insidious power of our current moment, that it has made itself feel so inevitable. It’s unsurprising, then, and a credit to Reitman’s craft, that part of me wanted to linger in &lt;em&gt;The Front Runner&lt;/em&gt;’s past. How strange that we could ever have cared so much. And how strange that we could ever have cared so little.&lt;/p&gt;","rubric":"Review","socialTitle":"Sex, Secrets, and Hugh Jackman Roil the Nation in The Front Runner","socialDescription":"Jason Reitman’s look at a 1980s political scandal is solid, but not as relevant as it wants to be.","seoTitle":"The Front Runner Review: Sex, Secrets, and Hugh Jackman Roil the Nation","seoDescription":"Jason Reitman’s look at a 1980s political scandal is solid, but not as relevant as it wants to be.","channel":"Hollywood","subChannel":"Movies","issueDate":"","ledeCaption":"","contentSource":"web","canonicalUrl":"","contentType":"","textMimeType":"","tags":["review","reviews"],"revisionAuthor":"Richard Lawson","meta":{"collectionName":"articles","modelName":"article","publishable":true,"identifiable":true,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":true,"hierarchical":false},"interactiveOverride":"","id":"5be0acc2d397092d264cc0be","revision":33,"createdAt":"November 5, 2018 3:49 pm","modifiedAt":"November 6, 2018 12:21 am","revisionCreatedAt":"November 6, 2018 12:21 am","_embedded":{"categories-channels":[{"fields":{"name":"Movies","slug":"movies","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5ae9f120c639a3587939aa6b","revision":0,"createdAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modifiedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}}],"categories-tags":[{"fields":{"name":"review","slug":"review","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5b4cb7e76c0055288786d9f6","revision":0,"createdAt":"July 16, 2018 11:21 am","modifiedAt":"July 16, 2018 11:21 am","revisionCreatedAt":"July 16, 2018 11:21 am","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}},{"fields":{"name":"reviews","slug":"reviews","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5b4cb7e74f46c70bca18e2e3","revision":0,"createdAt":"July 16, 2018 11:21 am","modifiedAt":"July 16, 2018 11:21 am","revisionCreatedAt":"July 16, 2018 11:21 am","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}}],"contributorsAuthor":[{"fields":{"bio":"Richard Lawson is the chief critic for &lt;em&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/em&gt;, reviewing film, television, and theatre.

Often referred to as our last real Movie Star (with capital letters), Roberts has maintained a fairly low profile the past decade, living part-time in New Mexico with husband &lt;strong&gt;Danny Moder&lt;/strong&gt; and children &lt;strong&gt;Hazel, Phinnaeus,&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Henry.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But she is now in the midst of her biggest publicity push in years, with two major projects out this fall: the Amazon Prime series &lt;em&gt;Homecoming&lt;/em&gt; (which marks her first regular television role), and the film &lt;em&gt;Ben Is Back&lt;/em&gt; (which co-stars &lt;strong&gt;Lucas Hedges&lt;/strong&gt;). Roberts has been everywhere these past few weeks, on the covers of &lt;em&gt;Entertainment Weekly&lt;/em&gt; (which wrote two separate cover stories on her, one for each project), and &lt;em&gt;Harper’s Bazaar,&lt;/em&gt; in which she posed, in a glam pink dress, mid rock-climb. She has driven news cycles out of quotes on everything from why she won’t “join niece &lt;strong&gt;Emma Roberts&lt;/strong&gt; on &lt;em&gt;American Horror Story,&lt;/em&gt;” to why she is &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/10/julia-roberts-quits-romantic-comedies\"&gt;over starring in romantic comedies&lt;/a&gt; (we still have not quite come to terms with the latter). In retrospect, her &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2018/06/julia-roberts-joins-instagram-first-post\"&gt;joining Instagram&lt;/a&gt; in late June makes more sense now, as well, giving herself a few months to get acclimated to the platform before the push for both projects.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As part of her publicity blitz, Roberts also took part in what’s becoming an &lt;a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/19/arts/music/celebrity-profile-death.html\"&gt;increasingly common&lt;/a&gt; stop for A-listers: a sit-down with another celebrity. Roberts and  &lt;strong&gt;Gwyneth Paltrow,&lt;/strong&gt; on the latest episode of &lt;a href=\"https://goop.com/the-goop-podcast/\"&gt;Paltrow’s Goop podcast&lt;/a&gt;, discuss &lt;em&gt;Homecoming,&lt;/em&gt; among many other topics, including Roberts’s marriage. Roberts says of Moder, “I think that first kind of real . . . ‘seismic shift’ was meeting Danny. Getting married to Danny. That was the first like, my life will never be the same in the most incredible, indescribable way. . . . He truly, to this day, to this minute is just my favorite human. I’m more interested in what he has to say or his point of view just than anybody. Really, I mean, we’re so lucky in that way. We just really, really like each other and we just enjoy each other’s company.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The two women also chat about turning forty (“I think that’s when I started to really find strength and some degree of self-acceptance,” Paltrow explains) and, yep, balancing work and family life (“Sometimes it’s smooth as silk,“ Roberts says, ”and sometimes you feel like you’re just hitting all the branches on the way down”). Count on Julia Roberts to somehow put a fresh spin on the “work vs. family” answer.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The two also chat about &lt;strong&gt;George Clooney,&lt;/strong&gt; Roberts’s friend and frequent co-star. Roberts tells Paltrow that one of the reasons she particularly enjoys hanging out with Clooney is that he is always able to find the . . . amusement in a situation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Roberts explains, “George actually said once when we were talking about, doesn’t it stink sometimes when you’re just like, on a movie and everything’s great, but there’s like one person that just doesn’t get the vibe or you know, so, we’re all kind of commiserating oh yes, we’ve all had that experience where one person just kind of doesn’t get it. They’re just kind of blowing it for everything and he goes, ‘Yeah, but you know what’s great about that person is you have somebody to talk about at the end of the night when you’re all having a drink before you go to bed.’ He is the sunny-side up.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Sadly they did not discuss Halloween plans on the episode, which might have provided an opportunity for Paltrow to expand on her fantastic &lt;a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BpoAy1BgVv-/?hl=en&amp;amp;taken-by=bradfalchuk\"&gt;Ally Maine outfit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;","rubric":"Gwyneth and Julia","socialTitle":"Julia Roberts Explains the Greatness of George Clooney to Gwyneth Paltrow","socialDescription":"The two movie stars sit down for a podcast.\n","seoTitle":"Julia Roberts Explains the Greatness of George Clooney to Gwyneth Paltrow","seoDescription":"The two movie stars sit down for a podcast.\n","channel":"Style","subChannel":"Celebrity","issueDate":"","ledeCaption":"","contentSource":"web","canonicalUrl":"","contentType":"","textMimeType":"","tags":["gwyneth paltrow","Julia Roberts"],"revisionAuthor":"Josh Duboff","meta":{"collectionName":"articles","modelName":"article","publishable":true,"identifiable":true,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":true,"hierarchical":false},"interactiveOverride":"","id":"5bdb0ef57d738b4e26033db7","revision":7,"createdAt":"November 1, 2018 10:34 am","modifiedAt":"November 1, 2018 11:03 am","revisionCreatedAt":"November 1, 2018 11:03 am","_embedded":{"categories-channels":[{"fields":{"name":"Style","slug":"style","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5ae9f11ff5bec5053bd80396","revision":0,"createdAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modifiedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}},{"fields":{"name":"Celebrity","slug":"celebrity","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5ae9f120b4f5c10202b9717c","revision":0,"createdAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modifiedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}}],"categories-tags":[{"fields":{"name":"gwyneth paltrow","slug":"gwyneth-paltrow","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5b4cb8106c0055288786da36","revision":0,"createdAt":"July 16, 2018 11:21 am","modifiedAt":"July 16, 2018 11:21 am","revisionCreatedAt":"July 16, 2018 11:21 am","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}},{"fields":{"name":"Julia Roberts","slug":"julia-roberts","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5b4cb7fefde90b0b82d2ec47","revision":0,"createdAt":"July 16, 2018 11:21 am","modifiedAt":"July 16, 2018 11:21 am","revisionCreatedAt":"July 16, 2018 11:21 am","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}}],"contributorsAuthor":[{"fields":{"name":"Josh Duboff","id":"53d70c86c980f8de611b70b1","revision":16,"createdAt":"July 28, 2014 10:52 pm","modifiedAt":"May 27, 2016 8:03 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"May 27, 2016 8:03 pm","meta":{"collectionName":"contributors","modelName":"contributor","publishable":true,"image":false,"identifiable":true,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":false},"bio":"Josh Duboff is a VF.com senior writer, based in New York, who covers entertainment and culture.

","familyName":"Bush","bio":"“More impressive than the painting’s aesthetic quality is the soul-searching introspection evident in the scene,” wrote New York magazine regarding the debut paintings of an artist who had only picked up a paintbrush for the first time a year earlier. The artist, a New York Times art critic wrote, was “something of a natural when it comes to oil paintings,” a man possessing “unsettling talent.” By all accounts, these were raves&amp;#8212;a surprise for any critic reviewing a newcomer, but infinitesimally more surprising given that that artist was George W. Bush.\n&lt;p&gt;It turns out that George W. Bush, the former fortunate First Son turned beloved Texas governor turned reviled 43rd president of the United States, spent the years following his tumultuous twin turns in the Oval Office tucked away in his Dallas home with a painting. His attention to detail was uncanny for a politician previously deemed so incurious. His work first hit the world’s stage in 2013, just four years after leaving the White House, when a Romanian hacker revealed images of two self-portraits Bush had created of himself&amp;#8212;one in the shower, and one in the bathtub. In the years since, Bush has focused his work outward, on landscapes and world leaders. In 2014, his presidential library exhibited 30 portraits he’d painted of people like Tony Blair, Vladimir Putin, and Angela Merkel.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Bush, the eponymous eldest son of the 41st commander in chief of the United States, had the presidential pedigree. As a Yale undergraduate and Harvard Business School veteran who completed stints as an oil executive and Major League Baseball team owner before serving as governor of the second-largest state, Bush also had a folksy, southern twanging, malaprop-popping relatability about him. He was a true Connecticut cowboy&amp;#8212;an Ivy Leaguer with White House roots and Texas boots who practically invented the idea that a president should be someone the electorate would want to down a beer with. He could not correctly pronounce “nuclear,” yet he could pull off starting a get-out-the-vote campaign speech with a story about pig manure.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;On the issue of voting, Bush’s first bid for the White House against then sitting vice president Al Gore was so close it came down to a recount and, eventually, a Supreme Court ruling. It all came down to votes in Florida, to ballots and “hanging chads,” and weeks of legal battles until the high court declared an end to the recount, with Bush as the victor. It was the fourth time in history that a president took the White House but did not win the popular vote.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Bush’s presidency was equally fraught. Less than eight months after assuming office, two planes flew straight into the Twin Towers in New York City, toppling them to the ground. Another flew into the Pentagon, and a fourth crashed in Pennsylvania. The events of September 11, 2001, ultimately launched a global war on terror&amp;#8212;an invasion into Afghanistan to stop the Taliban and another into Iraq over weapons of mass destruction, which never materialized&amp;#8212;that continues to this day.

The first trailer has finally dropped for &lt;em&gt;Vice,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Adam McKay’s&lt;/strong&gt; upcoming biopic about &lt;strong&gt;Dick Cheney&lt;/strong&gt; (played by an &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/10/christian-bale-dick-cheney-movie\"&gt;unrecognizable, uncanny &lt;strong&gt;Christian Bale&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).  It’s a searing first look, with Bale turning in a grizzled, domineering performance as the former vice president. Surprisingly, though, it’s &lt;strong&gt;Sam Rockwell&lt;/strong&gt; who really steals the show here, delivering an eerily perfect impression of &lt;strong&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#8212;nailing his Texan accent and consummate “well, &lt;em&gt;huh&lt;/em&gt;” expression.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Bush opens the trailer, chomping on a chicken leg and asking Cheney plainly if he’d like to be his vice president. Cheney, a businessman with greater aspirations, isn’t terribly interested in the symbolic gig. “However,” he begins, “if we came to a &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt; understanding, I can handle the more mundane jobs.” He just wants to handle, oh, a few things here and there&amp;#8212;like bureaucracy, the military, energy, and foreign policy. Small fries, all.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In the vein of McKay’s Oscar-winning based-on-recent-events film &lt;em&gt;The Big Short,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt; tells the story of the Cheney’s rise to power through sweeping shots, smart dialogue (penned by McKay), and movie magic. And makeup. So much makeup. Bale disappears into the role with the help of some extra weight, prosthetics, and seamless wig work. Nearly all traces of the Oscar-winning actor’s profile disappear when he slips into veep mode, save for the brief moment in the trailer where he’s shown playing young Cheney in a brown wig.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amy Adams&lt;/strong&gt; and her floofy blonde coif also get some shine as &lt;strong&gt;Lynne Cheney,&lt;/strong&gt; the former Second Lady. “When you have power, people will always try to take it from you, always,” she’s seen warning her husband. &lt;strong&gt;Steve Carell&lt;/strong&gt; also pops up into the trailer as former secretary of defense &lt;strong&gt;Donald Rumsfeld,&lt;/strong&gt; squinting and asking Cheney if the years have made him more ruthless. If you have to &lt;em&gt;ask&lt;/em&gt; . . .&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt; has yet to debut on the festival circuit, so critics haven’t been able to weigh in on whether it’ll be a major contender this awards season (though there are rumors it will debut at &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/09/ruth-bader-ginsburg-on-the-basis-of-sex-afi-fest\"&gt;this November’s AFI Fest&lt;/a&gt;). Its late entry and splashy, topical subject matter could mean that this film will be top of mind for Academy voters, giving McKay a fresh edge over competitors. Plus, the trailer is festooned with transformative performances from stars who either already have Oscars, or have previous nominations to their name. It’s one of the most Academy-friendly projects of the season&amp;#8212;and it doesn’t hurt that the film is based on a true story. &lt;strong&gt;Bradley Cooper&lt;/strong&gt; and his awards strategists are probably coming up with a plan of attack as we speak. &lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt; will hit theaters on Christmas Day.&lt;/p&gt;","rubric":"veep","socialTitle":"Vice Is About Dick Cheney, but Sam Rockwell’s George W.

is a grave threat to their lives, and that only he and his fellow Republicans can protect them. Two weeks ago, he claimed, without any evidence, that “criminals and unknown Middle Easterners are mixed in” with the group. Later, to heighten the drama, he dispatched thousands of troops to “secure” the border and deny the migrants entry, despite the fact that 1) they’re traveling on foot and weeks away, 2) the military doesn’t actually have the power to do anything once they’re there, and 3) the group plans to surrender at a port of entry and seek amnesty, which is the only way they can do so under current U.S. law. Perhaps worried that voters were not sufficiently scared enough to stave off a “blue wave,” though, on Wednesday, he pulled out the big guns and the mother of all dog whistles: a conspiracy theory about &lt;strong&gt;George Soros,&lt;/strong&gt; a favorite bogeyman among white nationalists and neo-Nazis:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"&gt;&lt;blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/atrupar/status/1057742231937912833\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/atrupar/status/1057742231937912833\"&gt;https://twitter.com/atrupar/status/1057742231937912833&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As even presidential boot-licker &lt;strong&gt;Anthony Scaramucci&lt;/strong&gt; will tell you, George Soros &lt;a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-25/scaramucci-says-trump-intentionally-lies-to-inflame-opponents\"&gt;is not paying the people headed for the U.S. border&lt;/a&gt;. You know who else probably knows that? Donald Trump. But with less than a week until the midterms, it’s apparently too difficult for him not to stoke anti-Semitic conspiracy theories about the financier&amp;#8212;&lt;a href=\"https://talkingpointsmemo.com/edblog/trump-rolls-out-anti-semitic-closing-ad\"&gt;just like the one included in a campaign ad during the 2016 election&lt;/a&gt;.

Bankers are also giving to Democrats.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A big part of that is anti-Trump, but a lot of the money is flowing to moderate Democrats, a sign Wall Street is seeking Washington allies to temper the impact of progressives such as Representative &lt;strong&gt;Maxine Waters&lt;/strong&gt; and Senator &lt;strong&gt;Elizabeth Warren,&lt;/strong&gt; who are poised to hit the industry with subpoenas and tougher oversight. . . . The securities and investment industry has given $56.8 million to Democratic congressional candidates and $33.4 million to Republicans this election cycle, according to data from the Center for Responsive Politics.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;“It’s going to be a very thin majority,” &lt;strong&gt;Paul Merski,&lt;/strong&gt; a lobbyist for the Independent Community Bankers Association, told Bloomberg. Moderate Democrats “will be the deciding factor. And they agree with us on a lot of things.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jamie Dimon: Of course pulling out of the Saudi conference was a total P.R. move&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You didn’t actually think the bank had any plans to stop doing business with the kingdom in the wake of a journalist being dismembered, did you? &lt;a href=\"https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-pro-rata-66358987-b773-480d-9b6f-98c45b3b38a5.html\"&gt;That’s adorable&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Dimon acknowledged during yesterday’s Axios event at U.C.L.A. that pulling out of his speaking role at the Future Investment Initiative in Riyadh was basically a P.R. move that won’t affect Saudi government behavior, adding it was done because JPMorgan “couldn’t be seen in any way condoning” the murder of Jamal Khashoggi. Dimon made a similar “you need to be at the table to engage” argument that he’s made when it comes to meeting with President Trump, despite their public disagreements.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The JPMorgan C.E.O. added that there are no plans to pull employees out of Saudi Arabia and that the bank would only stop doing business in the country if the American government put some sort of restrictions in place, a move that appears highly unlikely given &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/donald-trump-jamal-khashoggi-saudi-arabia\"&gt;how little&lt;/a&gt; Trump appears to care about the death of Khashoggi, and how fond his son-in-law is of Bone Saw bin Salman.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Private-equity firms just going to start making new-hire offers in the delivery room&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You just came out of the birth canal, how does $300,000 to start sound? &lt;a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/no-experience-no-problem-private-equity-lures-newbie-bankers-with-300-000-offers-1540998554?mod=hp_lead_pos3\"&gt;Per &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;An industrywide scramble is under way this week to hire young investment bankers. The instigator was Thoma Bravo LLC, which extended its first job offers this past weekend, according to people familiar with the matter. Word spread quickly to rivals, and by Monday interviews were under way at nearly every big firm, including Blackstone Group LP, Apollo Global Management LLC, Carlyle Group LP and TPG.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Welcome to private equity’s annual recruitment, the frenzied window of interviews and fast-expiring job offers that firms use to fill their junior ranks. The candidates graduated college as recently as last spring and landed at Wall Street investment-banking desks just weeks ago.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Those lucky enough to get offers will finish their two-year bank analyst programs and start at private-equity firms in the summer of 2020, with salaries that can exceed $300,000. (Junior bankers in analyst programs typically make in the low six figures, including bonuses.)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;While private-equity recruiting used to take place after would-be hires had finished their first year of investment banking, the timing has gotten earlier and earlier as firms attempt to nab their most-prized candidates, with interviews starting in February in 2014 and before Christmas last year. &lt;strong&gt;Patrick Curtis,&lt;/strong&gt; who runs the financial-careers Web site Wall Street Oasis, told the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt; he expects it to be only a matter of time before companies are making offers to undergrads two years before they want them to report for their first day on the job, which is obviously the first step in a series of steps that culminates in parents accepting offers on behalf of their fetuses on conception.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trump reminisces about firing people during “pledge to workers” event&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday afternoon, the White House devoted a large chunk of Donald Trump’s &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/trump-schedule-executive-time\"&gt;three-hour work day&lt;/a&gt; to an event &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5gbqLX5LwU\"&gt;called&lt;/a&gt; “Our Pledge to America’s Workers.” The discussion followed the July creation of the “National Council for the American Worker,” a group &lt;a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/president-donald-j-trumps-commitment-workforce-development-generates-training-opportunities-millions-americans/\"&gt;tasked with&lt;/a&gt; gathering signatures from private-sector companies pledging to create “educational and training opportunities,” and the first five minutes involved &lt;strong&gt;Ivanka Trump&lt;/strong&gt; reading off a list of signatories and talking about how daddy’s tax cuts and deregulations have made the economy so awesome. The rest of the event, for some reason, involved National Economic Council director &lt;strong&gt;Larry Kudlow&lt;/strong&gt; pretending he was back at the ole news desk and interviewing the president about&amp;#8212;and we’re paraphrasing here, but only slightly&amp;#8212;&lt;em&gt;what it’s like to be so f--king magnificent.&lt;/em&gt; (Kudlow’s actual opener: “You beat your critics, you beat your naysayers . . . how’d you do it?“) Naturally, this opened the door for some patented Trump-style answers (rambling, stream-of-conscious, riddled with falsehoods, completely unintelligible) about:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fictional steel plants that are being built as a result of his tariffs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"&gt;&lt;blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/atrupar/status/1057715539538255877\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/atrupar/status/1057715539538255877\"&gt;https://twitter.com/atrupar/status/1057715539538255877&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A plan to pay down the soaring debt that totally, 100 percent exists, wink-wink&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"&gt;&lt;blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/atrupar/status/1057717086221414400\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/atrupar/status/1057717086221414400\"&gt;https://twitter.com/atrupar/status/1057717086221414400&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What will happen to Americans’ life-savings if Democrats take the House&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"&gt;&lt;blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/TPMLiveWire/status/1057711600977801216\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/TPMLiveWire/status/1057711600977801216\"&gt;https://twitter.com/TPMLiveWire/status/1057711600977801216&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;And, for the pièce de résistance, which really needs to be read in full: a long-winded monologue in which he couldn’t keep a train of thought for more than three sentences, that touched on everything from firing people on &lt;em&gt;The Apprentice&lt;/em&gt; to firing people at the White House to how happy he was that the reality-TV show that convinced people he could be president tanked under the tutelage of that loser &lt;strong&gt;Arnold Schwarzenegger.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kudlow:&lt;/strong&gt; Last one, sir, I appreciate it. More of a personal question. Ivanka was talking about initiative and leadership and hard work, along with re-skilling. You’ve had an unbelievable career, you’re in construction, you’re in real estate, you were a very famous television host, and now you happen to be president. Did you go through re-skilling along the way?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trump:&lt;/strong&gt; I never thought of it that way but I guess I did, I suspect I did. Look, I’ve been in a lot of different jobs, I love building, I love the real-estate industry, it’s been very good to me, I think I’ve been good for it. I always pride myself on building on time, on budget, ideally ahead of time and ahead of budget. And we really have learned a lot. When you build a building, it’s almost like every trade. You’re involved with the unions in many cases, you’re involved with labor, you’re involved with finance, you’re involved with design, you’re involved with so many different things. In many cases, you are involved with international concepts and deals. So you learn a lot. And then I did &lt;em&gt;The Apprentice,&lt;/em&gt; which became a great show, a very, very successful show. Tremendously successful. I did it for 14 seasons, 12 years. So successful they put it on twice sometimes. And as soon as I left, that show went down the tubes. So you know? Just one of those things, right? I don’t know if I feel happy about that or sad. I’ve never figured that out . . . And I’ve certainly learned a lot here, we’re here almost two years. And we’ve learned a lot from doing this and I think we’ve put a lot of talent to work. We have great people that we work with and when they’re not so good we make changes and we have to do them maybe faster than other people would but I sort of can figure it out pretty well.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned for next week on state-run media when Kudlow asks the boss to recount his rags-to-riches story and guest co-host &lt;strong&gt;Sarah Huckabee

podcast.","body":"&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Julia Roberts&lt;/strong&gt; is &lt;em&gt;back,&lt;/em&gt; you guys. Often referred to as our last real Movie Star (with capital letters), Roberts has maintained a fairly low profile the past decade, living part-time in New Mexico with husband &lt;strong&gt;Danny Moder&lt;/strong&gt; and children &lt;strong&gt;Hazel, Phinnaeus,&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Henry.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But she is now in the midst of her biggest publicity push in years, with two major projects out this fall: the Amazon Prime series &lt;em&gt;Homecoming&lt;/em&gt; (which marks her first regular television role), and the film &lt;em&gt;Ben Is Back&lt;/em&gt; (which co-stars &lt;strong&gt;Lucas Hedges&lt;/strong&gt;). Roberts has been everywhere these past few weeks, on the covers of &lt;em&gt;Entertainment Weekly&lt;/em&gt; (which wrote two separate cover stories on her, one for each project), and &lt;em&gt;Harper’s Bazaar,&lt;/em&gt; in which she posed, in a glam pink dress, mid rock-climb. She has driven news cycles out of quotes on everything from why she won’t “join niece &lt;strong&gt;Emma Roberts&lt;/strong&gt; on &lt;em&gt;American Horror Story,&lt;/em&gt;” to why she is &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/10/julia-roberts-quits-romantic-comedies\"&gt;over starring in romantic comedies&lt;/a&gt; (we still have not quite come to terms with the latter). In retrospect, her &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2018/06/julia-roberts-joins-instagram-first-post\"&gt;joining Instagram&lt;/a&gt; in late June makes more sense now, as well, giving herself a few months to get acclimated to the platform before the push for both projects.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As part of her publicity blitz, Roberts also took part in what’s becoming an &lt;a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/19/arts/music/celebrity-profile-death.html\"&gt;increasingly common&lt;/a&gt; stop for A-listers: a sit-down with another celebrity. Roberts and  &lt;strong&gt;Gwyneth Paltrow,&lt;/strong&gt; on the latest episode of &lt;a href=\"https://goop.com/the-goop-podcast/\"&gt;Paltrow’s Goop podcast&lt;/a&gt;, discuss &lt;em&gt;Homecoming,&lt;/em&gt; among many other topics, including Roberts’s marriage. Roberts says of Moder, “I think that first kind of real . . . ‘seismic shift’ was meeting Danny. Getting married to Danny. That was the first like, my life will never be the same in the most incredible, indescribable way. . . . He truly, to this day, to this minute is just my favorite human. I’m more interested in what he has to say or his point of view just than anybody. Really, I mean, we’re so lucky in that way. We just really, really like each other and we just enjoy each other’s company.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The two women also chat about turning forty (“I think that’s when I started to really find strength and some degree of self-acceptance,” Paltrow explains) and, yep, balancing work and family life (“Sometimes it’s smooth as silk,“ Roberts says, ”and sometimes you feel like you’re just hitting all the branches on the way down”). Count on Julia Roberts to somehow put a fresh spin on the “work vs. family” answer.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The two also chat about &lt;strong&gt;George Clooney,&lt;/strong&gt; Roberts’s friend and frequent co-star. Roberts tells Paltrow that one of the reasons she particularly enjoys hanging out with Clooney is that he is always able to find the . . . amusement in a situation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Roberts explains, “George actually said once when we were talking about, doesn’t it stink sometimes when you’re just like, on a movie and everything’s great, but there’s like one person that just doesn’t get the vibe or you know, so, we’re all kind of commiserating oh yes, we’ve all had that experience where one person just kind of doesn’t get it. They’re just kind of blowing it for everything and he goes, ‘Yeah, but you know what’s great about that person is you have somebody to talk about at the end of the night when you’re all having a drink before you go to bed.’ He is the sunny-side up.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Sadly they did not discuss Halloween plans on the episode, which might have provided an opportunity for Paltrow to expand on her fantastic &lt;a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BpoAy1BgVv-/?hl=en&amp;amp;taken-by=bradfalchuk\"&gt;Ally Maine outfit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;","rubric":"Gwyneth and Julia","socialTitle":"Julia Roberts Explains the Greatness of George Clooney to Gwyneth Paltrow","socialDescription":"The two movie stars sit down for a podcast.\n","seoTitle":"Julia Roberts Explains the Greatness of George Clooney to Gwyneth Paltrow","seoDescription":"The two movie stars sit down for a podcast.\n","channel":"Style","subChannel":"Celebrity","issueDate":"","ledeCaption":"","contentSource":"web","canonicalUrl":"","contentType":"","textMimeType":"","tags":["gwyneth paltrow","Julia Roberts"],"revisionAuthor":"Josh Duboff","meta":{"collectionName":"articles","modelName":"article","publishable":true,"identifiable":true,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":true,"hierarchical":false},"interactiveOverride":"","id":"5bdb0ef57d738b4e26033db7","revision":7,"createdAt":"November 1, 2018 10:34 am","modifiedAt":"November 1, 2018 11:03 am","revisionCreatedAt":"November 1, 2018 11:03 am","_embedded":{"categories-channels":[{"fields":{"name":"Style","slug":"style","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5ae9f11ff5bec5053bd80396","revision":0,"createdAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modifiedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}},{"fields":{"name":"Celebrity","slug":"celebrity","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5ae9f120b4f5c10202b9717c","revision":0,"createdAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modifiedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}}],"categories-tags":[{"fields":{"name":"gwyneth paltrow","slug":"gwyneth-paltrow","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5b4cb8106c0055288786da36","revision":0,"createdAt":"July 16, 2018 11:21 am","modifiedAt":"July 16, 2018 11:21 am","revisionCreatedAt":"July 16, 2018 11:21 am","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}},{"fields":{"name":"Julia Roberts","slug":"julia-roberts","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5b4cb7fefde90b0b82d2ec47","revision":0,"createdAt":"July 16, 2018 11:21 am","modifiedAt":"July 16, 2018 11:21 am","revisionCreatedAt":"July 16, 2018 11:21 am","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}}],"contributorsAuthor":[{"fields":{"name":"Josh Duboff","id":"53d70c86c980f8de611b70b1","revision":16,"createdAt":"July 28, 2014 10:52 pm","modifiedAt":"May 27, 2016 8:03 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"May 27, 2016 8:03 pm","meta":{"collectionName":"contributors","modelName":"contributor","publishable":true,"image":false,"identifiable":true,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":false},"bio":"Josh Duboff is a VF.com senior writer, based in New York, who covers entertainment and culture.

It’s fueled by an activist media and (anti) social media and it’s barbaric. We are humans and thus fallible. Let’s take better care of each other.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;#39;t the first time Bush has attempted a rhetorical airing of grievances. In December of 2017, the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; published &lt;a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/03/opinion/billy-bush-trump-access-hollywood-tape.html\"&gt;an op-ed&lt;/a&gt; in which he addressed the women who had accused Trump of sexual assault. “I will never know the fear you felt or the frustration of being summarily dismissed and called a liar, but I do know a lot about the anguish of being inexorably linked to Donald Trump,” he wrote.

But Bush’s version of the &lt;em&gt;Access Hollywood&lt;/em&gt; story proves that, however formative the last two years have been, he doesn’t fully understand what happened&amp;#8212;or who the real victims are. Then again, blaming the media worked fairly well to get Kavanaugh and Trump what they wanted. Maybe Bush has learned something after all.&lt;/p&gt;","rubric":"men, too","socialTitle":"Billy Bush Would Like to End the “War on Flaws,” Please","socialDescription":"The former Access Hollywood host

over the weekend. The 36-year-old daughter of &lt;strong&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Laura Bush&lt;/strong&gt; tied the knot with screenwriter &lt;strong&gt;Craig Louis Coyne&lt;/strong&gt; at Walker’s Point in Kennebunkport, Maine, where her family has &lt;a href=\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2018/05/20/year-old-president-bush-due-arrive-maine/vr07ZH9LrRKD3ooTsYwSsJ/story.html\"&gt;long had a home&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The bride, who is the co-founder and chair of nonprofit Global Health Corps, wore an ivory silk &lt;strong&gt;Vera Wang&lt;/strong&gt; custom gown and was walked down the aisle by her father, as well as her grandfather, former president &lt;strong&gt;George H.W. Bush.&lt;/strong&gt; Her grandmother, after whom she was named, &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2018/04/barbara-bush-obituary\"&gt;died at the age of 92&lt;/a&gt; in April, but the younger Barbara was able to include her in her special day. She &lt;a href=\"https://people.com/politics/barbara-bush-married-first-daughter-wedding/\"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that she wore a bracelet her grandfather gave her grandmother on their 70th anniversary in 2015. Her something blue was a pair of blue earrings from her twin sister and matron of honor, &lt;strong&gt;Jenna Bush Hager.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;“I’m crying 24 hours later . . . there were so many happy tears,” Bush Hager, the &lt;em&gt;Today&lt;/em&gt; show contributor, &lt;a href=\"https://www.today.com/video/jenna-bush-hager-shares-details-of-sister-barbara-s-private-wedding-1339151939697?v=raila&amp;amp;\"&gt;said when she called in to the show&lt;/a&gt; from Maine Monday morning. “They wanted to get married here [Maine], because my grandfather’s here, so it was a very secret wedding&amp;#8212;a little bit like my elusive sister&amp;#8212;but also just family in a place that means family love, and it was beautiful.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;She said that she gave a toast to her sister at the ceremony. “I just told her and everybody how much she means to me, but I ended, actually, with a letter that my grandfather wrote to my grandmother. Because I searched all the romantics, and Shakespeare just wasn’t doing it. [Her grandfather] was sitting right next to me as I read it.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;She added that her grandfather, who is 94 years old and was briefly hospitalized earlier this year, was able to stay through the dinner after the wedding. But it was her youngest daughter, three-year-old &lt;strong&gt;Poppy,&lt;/strong&gt; the ring bearer, who Bush Hager says “stole the show,” by nearly tackling her aunt with a bear hug during a solemn moment of prayer in the ceremony.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The twins’ aunt, &lt;strong&gt;Dorothy “Doro” Bush Koch,&lt;/strong&gt; officiated the wedding.&lt;/p&gt;","rubric":"the bush

Despite the refreshing success of &lt;em&gt;Fury Road,&lt;/em&gt; his 2015 box-office and critical hit, the director has been &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/04/mad-max-fury-road-legal-battles-sequel\"&gt;hampered in his efforts&lt;/a&gt; to move forward with a new installment, reportedly titled &lt;em&gt;Mad Max: The Wasteland.&lt;/em&gt; Good night, sweet prince, all &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhm-4kDBhio\"&gt;shiny and chrome&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now, the good news: Miller is instead focusing his efforts on directing a new epic starring &lt;strong&gt;Idris Elba&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Tilda Swinton,&lt;/strong&gt; according to &lt;a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/idris-elba-tilda-swinton-star-george-millers-epic-1154996?\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Hollywood Reporter.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Few details are known about the film, titled &lt;em&gt;Three Thousand Years of Longing,&lt;/em&gt; a.k.a. &lt;em&gt;Djinn;&lt;/em&gt; per &lt;em&gt;T.H.R.,&lt;/em&gt; it’ll revolve around a love story that involves a genie. It’s not clear who Elba and Swinton will play. But hey: between this and the &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/10/aladdin-teaser-trailer-mena-massoud\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aladdin&lt;/em&gt; reboot&lt;/a&gt;, it’s just one more movie before we’ve officially got a genie trend going.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Miller has not yet secured financing for the project, but, as &lt;em&gt;T.H.R.&lt;/em&gt; notes, he’ll be shopping it around to studios and financiers at next week’s American Film Market event in Santa Monica. According to &lt;a href=\"https://variety.com/2018/film/news/idris-elba-tilda-swinton-three-thousands-years-of-longing-1202994109/\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Variety,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Miller will write the script and produce alongside &lt;strong&gt;Doug Mitchell&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;em&gt;Fury Road&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;After the success of &lt;em&gt;Fury Road,&lt;/em&gt; Miller planned to make more films set in his &lt;em&gt;Mad Max&lt;/em&gt; universe. Star &lt;strong&gt;Charlize Theron&lt;/strong&gt; confirmed that the director had two more scripts ready to go that filled out backstories for her character, Furiosa, and &lt;strong&gt;Tom Hardy’s&lt;/strong&gt; Max. However, Miller then became &lt;a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/movies/bitter-court-battle-over-mad-max-fury-road-blocks-two-new-movies-20180412-p4z98o.html\"&gt;embroiled in a legal battle&lt;/a&gt; with the film’s studio, Warner Bros., suing the company over unpaid earnings. In a cross-claim, Warner Bros. alleged that Miller’s production went way over budget, partly due to changes that didn’t get the studio’s approval. So there: we may never get &lt;em&gt;Mad Max: The Wasteland,&lt;/em&gt; but we will get Tilda Swinton, Idris Elba, love, and a genie. Fair enough trade!&lt;/p&gt;","rubric":"shiny and chrome","socialTitle":"George Miller Pausing Mad Max Sequels to Direct an Epic Starring Idris Elba, Tilda Swinton","socialDescription":"Their love

The two were accompanied in the car by Lady &lt;strong&gt;Louise Windsor,&lt;/strong&gt; their 14-year-old cousin, presumably put in charge of keeping them in line.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"&gt;&lt;blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/InStyle/status/1050686943393009667\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/InStyle/status/1050686943393009667\"&gt;https://twitter.com/InStyle/status/1050686943393009667&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When they stepped out of the car to enter the chapel, Charlotte continued practicing her wave&amp;#8212;even refusing to hold George’s hand, as was clearly intended, and turning back around to face the crowds. Meanwhile, a fellow page boy, six-year-old &lt;strong&gt;Louis de Givenchy,&lt;/strong&gt; danced an out-and-out jig on the steps; being cooped up in a car is a lot for any six-year-old.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Inside the chapel, seven-year-old &lt;strong&gt;Savannah Phillips&lt;/strong&gt; was placed between George and Charlotte for their roles in the processional, though she might not exactly be a calming influence&amp;#8212;over the summer, in a single weekend, she was spotted &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2018/06/prince-george-tumbling-push-savannah-phillips\"&gt;pushing George down a hill&lt;/a&gt; at a polo match and clapping her hand over his mouth during Trooping the Colour.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;At this point, George and Charlotte are old pros, having walked in more weddings than &lt;strong&gt;Katherine Heigl&lt;/strong&gt; in that movie about walking &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2018/05/prince-george-suit-princess-charlotte-dress-prince-harry-meghan-markle-wedding-role\"&gt;in a lot of weddings&lt;/a&gt;. I think it was called &lt;em&gt;Always the Page Boy, Never the Page&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Their official royal wedding roles are page boy and bridesmaid, respectively. Alongside them are Princess Eugenie’s cousins’ children, including &lt;strong&gt;Autumn&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Peter Phillips’s&lt;/strong&gt; daughters, Savannah and &lt;strong&gt;Isla,&lt;/strong&gt; six; &lt;strong&gt;Zara&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Mike Tindall’s&lt;/strong&gt; daughter &lt;strong&gt;Mia,&lt;/strong&gt; four; and &lt;strong&gt;Sophie Winkleman&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Freddie Windsor’s&lt;/strong&gt; daughter &lt;strong&gt;Maud,&lt;/strong&gt; five.

Martin shared a few tidbits that HBO, apparently, was hoping to keep a lid on.","body":"&lt;p&gt;It’s no secret that HBO has severely heightened the security and secrecy of its final season of &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones.&lt;/em&gt; That tight control also seems to extend to the show’s proposed spin-off, as author &lt;strong&gt;George R.R. Martin&lt;/strong&gt; himself learned this week. Martin has been excitedly and understandably spreading the news about the upcoming &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/06/game-of-thrones-prequel-pilot-order\"&gt;planned spin-off&lt;/a&gt;, which will be run by &lt;strong&gt;Jane Goldman&lt;/strong&gt; (as well as some other &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/05/game-of-thrones-four-spin-offs-george-rr-martin\"&gt;potential series&lt;/a&gt; that are still in the works). But in his excitement, he may have over-shared slightly on his personal blog.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;While promoting his upcoming Targaryen history book &lt;em&gt;Fire &amp;amp; Blood,&lt;/em&gt; out later this month, Martin heavily implied that one project in the works at HBO would be dragon-related. The author was then compelled to apologize and retract.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;When commenting on the news that &lt;strong&gt;Naomi Watts&lt;/strong&gt; would join a yet-untitled &lt;em&gt;Thrones&lt;/em&gt; prequel series, Martin mistakenly &lt;a href=\"http://georgerrmartin.com/notablog/2018/10/30/long-night-casting/\"&gt;identified&lt;/a&gt; the show as having a title: &lt;em&gt;The Long Night.&lt;/em&gt; Though that is what Martin has been informally calling the series&amp;#8212;and has been quite vocal that it’s what he would &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; it to be called&amp;#8212;he wrote this in a &lt;a href=\"http://georgerrmartin.com/notablog/2018/11/05/football-fire-and-other-stuff/\"&gt;later post&lt;/a&gt;: “HBO has informed me that the Jane Goldman pilot is not (yet) titled &lt;em&gt;The Long Night.&lt;/em&gt; That’s certainly the title I prefer, but for the moment the pilot is still officially untitled. So . . . mea culpa, mea culpa, mea culpa.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;By chastising Martin, HBO may simply be trying to exert control over when the title of the upcoming prequel will be revealed. (The network is fond of a &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/03/what-is-the-game-of-thrones-season-7-release-date\"&gt;splashy reveal&lt;/a&gt;, after all.) Or HBO may have a more franchise-friendly name in mind. With the network desperate to retain the massive viewing audience from its flagship show, it wouldn’t surprise me if this prequel series were called something like &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones: Origins.&lt;/em&gt; Hopefully Martin can get what he wants in the end&amp;#8212;even if that something is &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones: The Long Night.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;More intriguing than this naming snafu, however, is the question of dragons. Before HBO spoke with Martin about the importance of secrecy, he teased this: “Meanwhile, there are still a couple of other possible prequels in active development. I can’t tell you the subject matter of those projects, no, sorry, wish I could. The readers among you might want to grab a copy of &lt;em&gt;Fire &amp;amp; Blood&lt;/em&gt; when it is released on November 20, though.” Martin didn’t &lt;em&gt;technically&lt;/em&gt; reveal that one of the potential &lt;em&gt;Thrones&lt;/em&gt; spin-offs still in the works would center on the dragon riders of his new book&amp;#8212;but he certainly implied it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Yet HBO seems to prefer that we not think about the fact that other series are even still in the works. Speaking to reporters earlier this summer at the Television Critics Association press tour, HBO’s president of programming, &lt;strong&gt;Casey Bloys,&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.indiewire.com/2018/07/game-of-thrones-spinoffs-prequel-hbo-casey-bloys-1201987800/\"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; emphatically:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There are [other prequel ideas] that are good, there are others that\nare not going forward. But I don’t want to get into that individually,\nother than to say that we’re excited about the pilot we’re shooting\nand we’re just looking for a director now, we’re just casting. I don’t\nimagine there will be any more activity on the prequels until we see\nhow this goes. I’m not holding one back and we’re [not] going to make an\nannouncement any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Bloys did later tell &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/hbos-casey-bloys-game-thrones-wait-big-little-lies-true-detective-returns-1074182\"&gt;The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; that he was open to more than one prequel series going forward: “I’ll do anywhere from zero to five! Though probably more likely one. But we’ll see.” The idea that at least &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; of those other projects should center on the Targaryens is hardly revolutionary; those fire-breathing dragons are, of course, a massive hit with audiences. In fact, some fans were surprised to see that the show’s first spin-off concept will center on the dragon-less era of Westerosi history. But C.G.I. dragons also don’t come cheap, and it’s reasonable to assume that HBO wouldn’t want to gamble all its money on a Targaryen-centric spin-off before seeing how many original &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt; fans follow the franchise into its spin-offs.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Either way, it makes sense that Martin&amp;#8212;who, naturally, also wants to sell copies of his own book&amp;#8212;would draw a link between whatever is brewing at HBO and the lavishly illustrated new volume he is putting out on November 20. After hearing back from HBO, however, Martin’s lips are sealed for now. “I could tell you more, but I am not supposed to. We also have a couple of other successor shows still in development, but I cannot tell you about those either. Sorry. . . . Hush hush, it’s Hollywood, they like news to come through officially approved channels out there,” he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;","rubric":"Game On","socialTitle":"Game of Thrones Author Drops a Tantalizing Spin-Off Hint, Much to HBO’s Dismay","socialDescription":"George R.R.

But all managed to successfully disappear into the part, a role that has transformed over the decades (and 11 films) from the embodiment of “pure evil” (as Donald Pleasence’s paranoid Dr. Loomis put it in the original film) to a recognizably human stain on real, flesh-and-blood survivors like Loomis and Laurie Strode (&lt;strong&gt;Jamie Lee Curtis&lt;/strong&gt;), Michael’s sister&amp;#8212;the P.T.S.D.-stricken star of &lt;strong&gt;David Gordon Green’s&lt;/strong&gt; 2018 &lt;em&gt;Halloween,&lt;/em&gt; which comes to theaters October 19.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Michael Myers is, admittedly, a bit of a cipher; in an interview, 2007 &lt;em&gt;Halloween&lt;/em&gt;-remake director &lt;strong&gt;Rob Zombie&lt;/strong&gt; aptly described the part as “a lead character whose face you never see, and who never says anything.” But each man who’s played him has brought something unique to the role. Here, seven actors who have played Michael open up about scaring children, walking like wood through water, and setting themselves on fire&amp;#8212;all in the name of &lt;em&gt;Halloween.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"callout feature-large\" data-type=\"callout\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The role of Michael Myers can be subtly challenging; because the character wears a mask and doesn’t speak, he must be understood through body language. Since the beginning of the&lt;/em&gt; Halloween &lt;em&gt;franchise, that has led casting directors, producers, and stunt coordinators to emphasize stunt-readiness over other traditional on-camera experience&amp;#8212;and the ability to move with a menacing, catlike grace.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rob Zombie, Director, &lt;em&gt;Halloween&lt;/em&gt; (2007):&lt;/strong&gt; The funny thing about that mask: it’s so blank that everybody projects on to it what they want to see, and how he should behave. Sometimes, I’d get pushback along the lines of, “Michael Myers can’t do that?” According to who? The &lt;em&gt;Michael Myers Handbook&lt;/em&gt;? I never got a copy of that.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nick Castle, Michael Myers, &lt;em&gt;Halloween&lt;/em&gt; (1978):&lt;/strong&gt; I was paid $25 per day for &lt;em&gt;Halloween.&lt;/em&gt; That was a lot at the time! You have to remember: my interest in doing the film was being on set, so I could demystify the experience of filmmaking and directing. I expected to hang around the set for no money. But hey, $25 per day, and all I had to do was wear a rubber mask.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It’s a mystery what John [Carpenter, who directed the first &lt;em&gt;Halloween&lt;/em&gt;] saw in me and the way I moved. I asked John, “What is this character going to do?” And he said, “Just walk across the street.” I knew Michael’s movements weren’t going to be robotic. He was a real guy. He’s not rushing.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dick Warlock, Michael Myers, &lt;em&gt;Halloween II&lt;/em&gt; (1981):&lt;/strong&gt; [&lt;em&gt;Halloween II&lt;/em&gt; director &lt;strong&gt;Rick Rosenthal&lt;/strong&gt;] never gave me any instruction on how to play [Michael]&amp;#8212;nothing at all about the walk. Debra Hill was there every day, and Debra never said, “Can you make the walk a little faster, Dick?” or “Can you make your movements a little swifter?” Years later, in an interview, she said, “Dick Warlock never got the walk down.” Well, give me a break. I’m a stunt guy; I’m not an actor. If I wasn’t doing it right, you should have told me.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don Shanks, Michael Myers, &lt;em&gt;Halloween 5&lt;/em&gt; (1989):&lt;/strong&gt; I went in to meet with [director &lt;strong&gt;Dominique Othenin-Girard&lt;/strong&gt;]. His one direction was, “I want you to get up and walk like wood through water.” I did, and he said, “Perfect, you got it.” I interpreted that direction as: you’re rigid, but you’re still adapting to the water. You’re moving smoothly through the water; you’re not getting pushed through it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chris Durand, Michael Myers, &lt;em&gt;Halloween H20: 20 Years Later&lt;/em&gt; (1998):&lt;/strong&gt; Think about how a tiger will lock eyes on its prey with a singular focus.  As I was stalking my victims, I tilted my head down slightly, locked onto them, and did a deep, guttural growl. To his credit, the sound guy picked up on my growling and subtly layered it into the final edit. I don’t believe that any of my castmates ever picked up on that, but it lent a certain primal energy to each take.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;James Jude Courtney, Michael Myers, &lt;em&gt;Halloween&lt;/em&gt; (2018)&lt;/strong&gt;: Years ago, I met a real hit man through a mutual acquaintance&amp;#8212;he wanted his life story written, so he was living with me. He had just left a safe house and served in a penitentiary up in the Northwest. I absorbed his life just by hanging out with him every day. I took him to see a film I was in called &lt;em&gt;The Hit List.&lt;/em&gt; We walked out of the screening, and he said to me, “Jimmy, it’s a really nice movie, but that’s not how you kill people.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;“Really?”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;“I’m gonna show you how.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There’s a stealth efficiency to the way an actual trained killer works. Movies tend to dilute that quality with dramatic pauses and dialogue, which a true predator would never waste time doing. That efficiency is what I took to the part of Michael Myers.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Michael has been terrifying children for decades, both on-screen and off&amp;#8212;and appearing with the character can be especially frightening for a young actor. Still, many of Michael’s teenage and pre-teen targets have taken to working with him like old pros.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shanks:&lt;/strong&gt; [then-11-year-old co-star &lt;strong&gt;Danielle Harris&lt;/strong&gt;] did all her own stunts. I was literally stabbing in the dark, because I can’t see her. They blind Michael at the end of &lt;em&gt;Halloween II,&lt;/em&gt; so they put nylon netting over the eyes, which makes it a little difficult doing the stuntwork.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But Danielle trusted me. There’s a scene where I’m chasing her in a car, and I get pretty close to her. But she knows I’m not going to hit her. That gives you a little more freedom to do what you want&amp;#8212;to be creative, but not to have that fear of “Is this guy going to hit me?”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Durand:&lt;/strong&gt; We shot the exterior of the rest-stop sequence on the first day of shooting. The setup: a mom and her young daughter pull into a rest stop, desperately needing to use the bathroom. They rush up to the ladies’ room, but the door is locked. So they go into the men’s room instead. I was supposed to crack the men’s-room door open and peek over the doorframe. But they neglected to tell the little girl that I was in there, and that she wasn’t supposed to pull the door open.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;[Seven-year-old actress &lt;strong&gt;Emmalee Thompson&lt;/strong&gt;] marched right up to the door, swung it open, and came face-to-face with Michael. I watched the blood drain from her face.  Boom, that fast&amp;#8212;we were down for an hour as I ripped the mask off and helped to get her calmed down again. After about an hour, she decided that I wasn’t such a bad guy after all.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"callout feature-large\" data-type=\"callout\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zombie:&lt;/strong&gt; There’s a scene, in the first remake, where Michael bursts through the door. Everybody knew what was going to happen, because the scene was in the script. But Tyler’s big, and I don’t know if she [actress &lt;strong&gt;Jenny Gregg Stewart&lt;/strong&gt;] had seen his mask yet. When he came smashing through the door, her scream was completely genuine. She told me it was; she was freaked out.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tyler Mane, Adult Michael, &lt;em&gt;Halloween&lt;/em&gt; (2007) and &lt;em&gt;Halloween II&lt;/em&gt; (2009):&lt;/strong&gt; You mean Jenny Gregg Stewart from the first movie? I don’t remember that! We always rehearse the scenes several times before shooting, and I only put the mask on at the very last minute. So that surprises me, but maybe. In the moment, it’s good that she was scared, I guess!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daeg Faerch, Young Michael, &lt;em&gt;Halloween&lt;/em&gt; (2007):&lt;/strong&gt; There’s that one shot right before I kill [&lt;strong&gt;William Forsythe&lt;/strong&gt;], and the camera is outside the house looking in. The killing scenes weren’t scary for me, but they left me alone in that house for that take, and I was afraid of the dark. I was young, and I was by myself.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stuntwork is key to Michael’s enduring appeal; in most&lt;/em&gt; Halloween &lt;em&gt;films, the masked villain appears to be just about indestructible. Stunt coordinators like Warlock and &lt;strong&gt;Donna Keegan&lt;/strong&gt; (from&lt;/em&gt; Halloween H20) &lt;em&gt;work to ensure their Michaels have what they need to safely hit their marks&amp;#8212;but human actors aren’t always as durable as the character they’re playing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Castle:&lt;/strong&gt; The most difficult scene is easy for me to remember. It was a scene shot in the middle of the night, where Michael jumps on top of a car as he’s escaping the mental hospital. It wasn’t freezing, but it was in the mid-40s. I was in a hospital gown and underpants. I don’t think John let me know what he had in store for me.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;He turns to the crew and says something like, “O.K., start the water cannons.” The hospital’s sprinkler system was more like a fire hose. The water arced into the air, and when it came down on me, it felt like icicles hitting me on the back.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;He yells “action.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It was the most painful thing I’d ever experienced outside of a broken arm. That was the one scene that I really remember thinking, “Maybe I should have got more than $25.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shanks:&lt;/strong&gt; The most physically demanding scene was when Michael gets blown out of the mine shaft, and I fall into the river, at the beginning of the film. That river was full of melted snow, so it was maybe 30 degrees. The mask was stuck to my face, and I couldn’t get the water out. I also had to grab a safety net on the other side of the river and pull myself out. If I missed the net and went around the river’s bend, I’d hit a water processing plant. Then I’d get killed.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warlock:&lt;/strong&gt; For the scene where I was set on fire: they quickly flashed on a wall of propane flames, and when I walked through the fire, the flames ignited my suit. Then I walked as slowly as I could. I had six stunt guys standing by with fire extinguishers, just waiting for me.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you watch closely, you’ll see there’s a little jiggle in my arms, and then I fall down. That’s because I burned my arm. I trusted the guys I got that stunt’s suit from, so I didn’t see that it had zippers on the arm. The flames went right through the suit. They were superficial burns, really; the doc applied a salve to them.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We did the stunt two times; for whatever reason, the first take didn’t work out. It got hot quicker than I thought it would. If it wasn’t for that zipper, I could have gone another 10, 15 seconds. It was intense.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Michael Myers has passed into popular legend&amp;#8212;but the men who played him, of course, also have very personal associations with the character. For these actors, Michael brings to mind thousands of enthusiastic horror-conventions fans, as well as co-stars like Pleasence and Curtis&amp;#8212;all of whom helped to make Michael an iconic horror monster.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mane:&lt;/strong&gt; [Michael] hits a very primitive nerve. He’s human, but he’s not. There’s something very off there when you can’t see the face or read what he’s thinking. He’s like a shark in that you can’t reason with him, you can’t out-run him, and he’s completely unstoppable. Plus, add that white mask with eyes that are skull-like holes, and everything about him screams “death.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shanks:&lt;/strong&gt; One guy came up to me and asked, “How do you do it?”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;“Do what?”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;“What do you do with the bodies?” He thought that we were actually killing people.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Castle:&lt;/strong&gt; There was a period of time where I’d think, “Oh my god, this is going to go on my tombstone. It won’t say anything about me directing &lt;em&gt;The Last Starfighter.&lt;/em&gt; It won’t say anything about anything else. All it’ll say is that I was known as the guy who wore a mask in &lt;em&gt;Halloween.&lt;/em&gt;” But then I loosened up. It’s not every day that you can look across your desk and see a plastic figurine of yourself. It’s a lot of fun.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Faerch:&lt;/strong&gt; I’ve been rapping for seven years now, but my fans kept telling me that they knew me from &lt;em&gt;Halloween,&lt;/em&gt; so I figured I should connect the two things together. Doing the music video for “Halloween on Friday the 13th” was really fun. I got to relive&amp;#8212;or re-kill&amp;#8212;some of my favorite moments.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Normally, fans all understand that it’s just a movie. There are times though when I have to impress upon them that that’s not me. I’m Daeg. I rap and hang out with my friends. I’m not Michael Myers.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"embed block video row\"&gt;&lt;div class=\"wrapper\"&gt;&lt;iframe height=\"430\" width=\"610\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/JS7z8fUZkEM\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allowtransparency=\"true\"&gt; &lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Courtney:&lt;/strong&gt; Fraternities are cool, whether it’s combat veterans or football players or journalists. That’s something that only these guys and I get to know. No one else will get to experience that. Part of the honor of this experience is being able to join a club with these distinguished gentlemen who happen to kill people for a living.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shanks:&lt;/strong&gt; One time, I had just wrapped for the night. And [co-star and series regular Donald Pleasence] raps on my trailer door and says, ”Might I ask a favor? I have this scene where I know that you’re out there, and it would help me if I knew that you really were physically out there&amp;#8212;even though I don’t see you.” I thought that was the least I could do.&lt;/p&gt;","rubric":"You Can’t Kill the Boogeyman","socialTitle":"Michael Myers, Unmasked","socialDescription":"Seven actors who have played Halloween’s iconic villain open up about giving life to a silent, indestructible killer—and occasionally injuring themselves for the sake of classic horror.","seoTitle":"Michael Myers, Unmasked","seoDescription":"Seven actors who have played Halloween’s iconic villain open up about giving life to a silent, indestructible killer—and occasionally injuring themselves for the sake of classic horror.","channel":"Hollywood","subChannel":"Movies","issueDate":"","ledeCaption":"George P.

Earlier this year, it was George’s page-boy pants and Charlotte’s enthusiastic wave that &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2018/05/prince-george-suit-princess-charlotte-dress-prince-harry-meghan-markle-wedding-role\"&gt;won over&lt;/a&gt; royal wedding watchers at &lt;strong&gt;Prince Harry&lt;/strong&gt; and __Meghan Markle’s wedding in May. They were just as charming, if not a &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2017/05/prince-george-princess-charlotte-pippa-middleton-wedding-page-boy-bridesmaid-kate\"&gt;little bit naughty&lt;/a&gt;, at their aunt &lt;strong&gt;Pippa Middleton’s&lt;/strong&gt; wedding in the spring of 2017. And they’ve done it again: on Saturday, they acted as page boy and bridesmaid at the Norfolk wedding of &lt;strong&gt;Sophie Carter,&lt;/strong&gt; a close friend of &lt;strong&gt;Kate Middleton’s.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This time, George, who &lt;a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/prince-george-wore-pants-to-the-royal-wedding-2018-5\"&gt;broke typical royal protocol&lt;/a&gt; in May by wearing pants and not shorts to his uncle’s wedding, seemed to follow the rule book this time. He wore blue knickerbockers, which hit just below his knee; under the knickerbockers, he and the other page boys wore white stockings.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The bride, who was named as one of Charlotte’s godparents upon the three-year-old’s birth in 2015, also stuck with a traditional look: she wore a long-sleeved, white lace gown, thick headband, and long veil. She can be seen, &lt;a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-6199275/Prince-George-steals-wedding-sister-Princess-Charlotte-looks-unimpressed.html\"&gt;per the &lt;em&gt;Daily Mail&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, picking up an unimpressed-looking Charlotte for photos.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Kate, who wore a blue Catherine Walker coat (we’ve &lt;a href=\"https://whatkatewore.com/2018/09/23/kate-mixes-old-new-for-sophie-carters-wedding/\"&gt;seen it before&lt;/a&gt; with a matching lace dress and flower crown, never seemed far behind her two wedding cherubs. &lt;strong&gt;Prince William,&lt;/strong&gt; who wore a black suit with a light blue vest underneath, also looked to be on Toddler Watch.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;George, according to the &lt;em&gt;Mail,&lt;/em&gt; was in quite the opposite mood from his sister, cheerily leading his fellow page boys on a march around St. Andrew’s Episcopal Church. (They were reportedly pretending to be soldiers.) That kind of confidence is unsurprising for a five-year-old who is in high demand for wedding parties.&lt;/p&gt;","rubric":"george","socialTitle":"Prince George Remains the Best Royal Wedding

He met Eugenie in Switzerland &lt;a href=\"https://www.townandcountrymag.com/society/tradition/a15839639/jack-brooksbank-facts/\"&gt;about seven years&lt;/a&gt; ago while “skiing in [a] Swiss resort town”; &lt;strong&gt;Sarah Ferguson&lt;/strong&gt; seems to like him; and . . . those seem to be the most pertinent facts about him!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But Brooksbank is letting us in&amp;#8212;somewhat surprisingly&amp;#8212;to his mindset in the weeks leading up to the wedding (which will be &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2018/10/how-to-watch-princess-eugenies-wedding-in-the-us\"&gt;televised&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. and the U.K., it was announced this week), as he spoke with &lt;a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-6241541/Princess-Eugenies-fianc-serve-alcohol-wedding-reception.html\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Daily Mail&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; columnist &lt;strong&gt;Sebastian Shakespeare&lt;/strong&gt; at the launch of Harry’s Bar, James Street this week. Brooksbank said he has arranged for, naturally, Casamigos to be served at the reception (as it reportedly was at &lt;strong&gt;Prince Harry&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Meghan Markle’s&lt;/strong&gt; reception, too). “I’ve not been kept out of all the planning. I get to decide some things. I’m in charge of drinks, and we’ll be serving Casamigos,” he said. (Brooksbank also owns a company titled, whaddya know, Jack Brooksbank Ltd., which “distributes alcoholic drinks.”)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Clooney attended Harry and Meghan’s wedding, but it is unclear if he’ll be at Eugenie and Brooksbank’s. “I can’t say if George Clooney is coming,” he told the &lt;em&gt;Daily Mail.&lt;/em&gt; (We are going to take that as a yes.) He added, “I’ll need to take a few minutes for myself before the speeches, because I’m terrified. It’s very exciting, but I’m a little bit nervous.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Thankfully for Brooksbank, some of the pressure will no doubt be taken off with the attention that will surely be paid to the presence of Meghan, &lt;strong&gt;Kate Middleton,&lt;/strong&gt; Harry, &lt;strong&gt;Prince William,&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Princess Charlotte,&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Georges,&lt;/strong&gt; both prince and (probably) Clooney, at the event.&lt;/p&gt;","rubric":"Royals","socialTitle":"Jack Brooksbank Says He Is “Terrified” Ahead of Marrying Princess Eugenie","socialDescription":"But is George Clooney coming to the wedding?","seoTitle":"Jack Brooksbank Says He Is “Terrified” Ahead of Marrying Princess Eugenie","seoDescription":"But is George Clooney coming to the wedding?","channel":"Style","subChannel":"Royals","issueDate":"","ledeCaption":"","contentSource":"web","canonicalUrl":"","contentType":"","textMimeType":"","tags":["Princess Eugenie"],"revisionAuthor":"Josh Duboff","meta":{"collectionName":"articles","modelName":"article","publishable":true,"identifiable":true,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":true,"hierarchical":false},"interactiveOverride":"","id":"5bb798cfd23564139e45cfa5","revision":6,"createdAt":"October 5, 2018 1:01 pm","modifiedAt":"October 5, 2018 1:04 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"October 5, 2018 1:04 pm","_embedded":{"categories-channels":[{"fields":{"name":"Style","slug":"style","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5ae9f11ff5bec5053bd80396","revision":0,"createdAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modifiedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}},{"fields":{"name":"Royals","slug":"royals","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5ae9f120fc4232048726e6d0","revision":0,"createdAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modifiedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}}],"categories-tags":[{"fields":{"name":"Princess Eugenie","slug":"princess-eugenie","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5b4cb8e46e1c450b65047dd7","revision":0,"createdAt":"July 16, 2018 11:25 am","modifiedAt":"July 16, 2018 11:25 am","revisionCreatedAt":"July 16, 2018 11:25 am","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}}],"contributorsAuthor":[{"fields":{"name":"Josh Duboff","id":"53d70c86c980f8de611b70b1","revision":16,"createdAt":"July 28, 2014 10:52 pm","modifiedAt":"May 27, 2016 8:03 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"May 27, 2016 8:03 pm","meta":{"collectionName":"contributors","modelName":"contributor","publishable":true,"image":false,"identifiable":true,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":false},"bio":"Josh Duboff is a VF.com senior writer, based in New York, who covers entertainment and culture.

So why does watching it feel, well, bad?","body":"&lt;p&gt;I’m not used to seeing people who look like me on TV. It’s a baked-in expectation, despite my own evolving awareness of diversity on television, and the industry’s examples of groundbreaking, representative work. When I do notice that stories feel like my own life, it’s not typically because the characters are Indian-American or first-generation immigrants, but because they are, like me, insufferable snobs who live in Brooklyn.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Watching NBC’s debuting comedy &lt;em&gt;I Feel Bad,&lt;/em&gt; which revolves around the life of Indian-American protagonist Emet (&lt;strong&gt;Sarayu Blue&lt;/strong&gt;), felt like looking in a funhouse mirror. Like me, Emet has a nerdy job and unresolved anger issues; my hair, at present, is a downmarket attempt to look like her hair. I’m also with a tall, disheveled white man (Emet’s husband, David, is played by perennial cute-husband &lt;strong&gt;Paul Adelstein&lt;/strong&gt;), and I also struggle to bridge the cultural divide between his experience of the world and that of my very Indian parents, led by my irrepressible mother. It was hard to ignore the resemblance between my own parents’ idiosyncrasies and the characters depicted by &lt;strong&gt;Brian George&lt;/strong&gt; (the Israeli-English actor best known as Babu Bhatt on &lt;em&gt;Seinfeld&lt;/em&gt;) and &lt;strong&gt;Madhur Jaffrey&lt;/strong&gt; (who, in addition to her sitcom role, is a &lt;a href=\"https://www.saveur.com/madhur-jaffrey-taste-of-india-cookbook\"&gt;world-famous ambassador&lt;/a&gt; of Indian cooking and the mother of another performer, &lt;strong&gt;Sakina Jaffrey&lt;/strong&gt;). In the second episode, George’s character, Sonny, steals fruit from a neighbor while wearing a brightly colored golf shirt&amp;#8212;and then has the temerity to call the police on an interloper he sees elsewhere. That’s my dad all right.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, there’s a flat cheeriness about Emet’s story that makes it nearly impossible for me to relate to; it’s like viewing my own life through a thick layer of candy coating. Emet’s problems might be similar to mine, but the strictures of a network sitcom prevent them from being unappealingly dark, weird, or heavy. I have enjoyed the episodes of &lt;em&gt;Fresh Off the Boat&lt;/em&gt; that I’ve seen, but I understand more now the &lt;a href=\"http://www.vulture.com/2015/01/eddie-huang-fresh-off-the-boat-abc.html\"&gt;frustrations&lt;/a&gt; of chef and memoirist &lt;strong&gt;Eddie Huang,&lt;/strong&gt; whose life the show is based on. In 2015, when that show debuted, he sounded off on what it turned into in the pages of &lt;em&gt;New York&lt;/em&gt; magazine: “a universal, ambiguous, cornstarch story about Asian Americans resembling moo goo gai pan . . . But who is that show written for?”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I find myself asking the same of &lt;em&gt;I Feel Bad,&lt;/em&gt; a show I nevertheless cannot tear my eyes away from. It’s a fresh idea, needled half to death; the sloppy and overfull pilot is what happens when a boardroom and a PowerPoint come together to make a television show. Emet is the daughter of immigrants, but she’s neutralized her otherness through immersion into the cult of American female domesticity; her problem, we’re told, is that she’s &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; giving. And as maddening as this mom-pandering is, it’s probably the only way this show could be sold.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What’s especially, painfully obvious, like a brick to the face, is how the show tries to ignore, or at least smooth over, the alienation Emet must feel. Emet’s only character trait, amidst the hastily sketched mom-and-wife tropes, is that she is Indian-American. But the commonplace agonies of immigrant life have been spun into tepid sitcom banter so unconvincingly upbeat that the grins seem to stifle screams.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is most marked in Emet’s relationship with her spry, judgmental mother, Maya (Jaffrey), which even in a sanitized pilot is barbed with poison. David jokes, early on, that his mother-in-law “screwed up” his wife, which prompts Emet to agree that her mother’s treatment led to her “tiny nervous bald spot,” presumably from anxiously yanking her own hair out. Maya’s first words to her daughter, a tight 45 seconds into the pilot, are: “Mama’s running off to work, huh. Fancy career lady, abandoning her kids.” Emet gives as good as she gets: as she buckles her baby into a stroller, she bends over and coos, “I’m so sorry we can’t afford to pay a stranger to take care of you.” In the primary drama of the first episode, Emet reminds her mother that Maya used to throw her shoes at her as a disciplinary tactic. Maya is unrepentant: “And you used to duck! Like a tiger!”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Emet and Maya’s relationship is not uncommon&amp;#8212;and neither are Maya’s parenting practices, which have parallels in other cultures around the world. (A colleague reminded me that &lt;em&gt;la chancla&lt;/em&gt; is as dreaded in Latin America as a &lt;em&gt;chappal&lt;/em&gt; is in India.) But in any paradigm, such a dynamic is not without attendant pain, and Emet is fairly direct about how much damage she feels her mother did to her. What’s exceptional about their relationship is not just that it is heightened with the drama of slipper-throwing, but that they have enacted this relationship in America, where a wildly different set of norms and expectations are at play; they are enacting it now that Emet’s an adult, with a white husband and three mixed-race children to witness her experience.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Throughout the first episode, Emet fixates on the problem of trying to be a good mother to her children without emulating her mother’s excesses. But the trauma of her own experience continues to snake across the screen, poorly suppressed yet without an outlet to emerge. Possibly for that very reason, the episode actually finds most of its comic energy in Emet’s co-workers, a group of regressive but lovable video-game programmers who spend their first on-screen scene debating whether Emet, their boss, is “doable.” (In their defense, she asked them the question&amp;#8212;but in &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; defense, that’s sexual harassment.) It’s a desperate attempt to bring the drama of Emet’s story out of a thorny mother-daughter dynamic and into the safer environment of sexually charged workplace banter. It has nothing to do with being Indian-American.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My most cynical guess for what went wrong here is simple but depressing: being Asian-American is not a sitcom premise. It’s rich territory, to be sure; the finest episodes of &lt;em&gt;Master of None,&lt;/em&gt; from &lt;strong&gt;Aziz Ansari&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Alan Yang,&lt;/strong&gt; were the episodes where the co-creators examined the legacies of their immigrant parents. The astonishing novel &lt;em&gt;Severance,&lt;/em&gt; from &lt;strong&gt;Ling Ma,&lt;/strong&gt; wraps a story of apocalypse into a series of bedside conversations with the narrator’s mother. And cannily, the film &lt;em&gt;Crazy Rich Asians,&lt;/em&gt; starring &lt;em&gt;Fresh Off the Boat&lt;/em&gt;’s &lt;strong&gt;Constance Wu,&lt;/strong&gt; is ultimately framed not as a romance between her character and &lt;strong&gt;Henry Golding’s,&lt;/strong&gt; but as an extended wooing of his formidable mother, played by &lt;strong&gt;Michelle Yeoh.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But this isn’t laugh-out-loud territory. Jaffrey is a spirited performer, and in the second preview episode, she snags at least one brilliant moment in forcing her white son-in-law to calculate how much it will cost to support her until death. But when Emet and Maya are on screen together, the show almost falls to pieces under the weight of trying to leaven their dynamic. It’s telling, and precedented; while that other Asian-American sitcom &lt;em&gt;Fresh Off the Boat&lt;/em&gt; features a complicated character portrait in the cold and hard-nosed Jessica Huang (Wu), the abusive philanderer Louis Huang has been re-written into a perpetually affable restaurateur played by cheery &lt;strong&gt;Randall Park.&lt;/strong&gt; Sitcoms have historically handled difficult material: &lt;em&gt;Married... with Children&lt;/em&gt; told the daily travails of a couple who hated each other, and &lt;em&gt;The Honeymooners&lt;/em&gt; used the threat of physical violence as a punch line. But maybe the average story of an immigrant person is harder to joke about.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As of its first two episodes, &lt;em&gt;I Feel Bad&lt;/em&gt; does not seem to know how to make comedy&amp;#8212;or even simply story&amp;#8212;out of its central anxieties of identity. Forcing a standard template onto a story about being different is strikingly wrongheaded. And that’s the bigger, and thornier, problem here: at some point in &lt;em&gt;I Feel Bad&lt;/em&gt;’s journey from idea to screen, it went from a comedy about being different to a sitcom about making different seem as safe, accessible, and non-threatening as possible. As it turns out, that’s not what being different means at all.&lt;/p&gt;","rubric":"Just Like Us","socialTitle":"I Feel Bad and the Uncanny Valley of On-Screen Representation","socialDescription":"I Feel Bad is my life (sort of).

Of course, his actual assets are both immaterial and immeasurable. The president of Russia has nearly complete control over the world’s largest geographical country, which he rules through a potent combination of love and fear.\n&lt;p&gt;Growing up in a hardscrabble housing block in St. Petersburg, Putin is believed to have taken up judo after he kept getting in fights with bigger kids. He still picks fights with stronger rivals today&amp;#8212;NATO and the United States chief among them&amp;#8212;and the former K.G.B. operative seems to try to keep President Barack Obama off-balance. When the pro-Russian president of Ukraine, &lt;strong&gt;Viktor Yanukovych,&lt;/strong&gt; was overthrown by pro-Western protesters in 2014, Putin quietly deployed masked, unmarked troops to the Crimean peninsula, seized control, and forced the region to hold a referendum declaring Crimea independent. Within two months, a large portion of the country had been annexed by the Russian Federation. The West was stunned again when Putin repeated his shadow war in Eastern Ukraine, engineering a separatist rebellion that was actually backed by thousands of undeclared Russian forces. Despite facing punishing U.S.-led sanctions for his repeated military incursions into Europe, Putin challenged Obama a third time by launching a successful military intervention in 2015 on behalf of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, cooperating with Iranian forces to wipe out the U.S.-backed opposition under the guise of driving back ISIS. All the while, Putin has sheltered N.S.A. whistle-blower Edward Snowden, thumbing his nose at the White House by portraying himself as a defender of civil liberties.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Russia, which has been alternatively controlled by Putin as prime minister and president since 1999, experienced a massive increase in living standards during his first presidency, from 2000 to 2008, before the world economic crisis, and later Western sanctions, brought the country to a standstill. But Putin’s strategic adventurism, in concert with his near-total control over Russian media, has cemented his reputation among the &lt;em&gt;Moskali&lt;/em&gt; for returning a sense of national greatness. Putin’s power is not limited to the former Soviet Union, either: Americans are similarly transfixed by his seductive illiberalism. The latest Westerner rumored to have fallen under his spell is none other than Wendi Deng, the ex-wife of billionaire media mogul Rupert Murdoch.&lt;/p&gt;","socialMedia":[],"photos":{"tout":[{"aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":1400,"height":700,"format":"JPEG","url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2016/06/01/574f45a5ee949d2f61432423_hive-contributor-profile-vladimir-putin.jpg"}},"revisionCreatedAt":"June 1, 2016 4:29 pm","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","image":true},"revisionAuthor":"Kelly Butler","filename":"hive-contributor-profile-vladimir-putin.jpg","_embedded":{"categories-channels":[],"variantXsmall":[],"variantSmall":[],"variantMedium":[],"variantLarge":[],"variantXlarge":[],"_categories":{}},"title":"hive-contributor-profile-vladimir-putin.jpg","credit":"By Mikhail Klimentyev/TASS/Getty Images.","_links":{},"id":"574f45a5b58adb2f614da233","createdAt":"June 1, 2016 4:29 pm","revision":2,"modifiedAt":"June 1, 2016 4:29 pm","contributors":{}}]},"pubDate":"May 25, 2017 11:21 am","url":"/people/vladimir-putin","mainPhotoContributors":{},"_embedded":{"photosTout":[{"fields":{"aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":1400,"height":700,"format":"JPEG","url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2016/06/01/574f45a5ee949d2f61432423_hive-contributor-profile-vladimir-putin.jpg"}},"revisionCreatedAt":"June 1, 2016 4:29 pm","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","image":true},"revisionAuthor":"Kelly Butler","filename":"hive-contributor-profile-vladimir-putin.jpg","_embedded":{"categories-channels":[],"variantXsmall":[],"variantSmall":[],"variantMedium":[],"variantLarge":[],"variantXlarge":[],"_categories":{}},"title":"hive-contributor-profile-vladimir-putin.jpg","credit":"By Mikhail Klimentyev/TASS/Getty Images.","_links":{},"id":"574f45a5b58adb2f614da233","createdAt":"June 1, 2016 4:29 pm","revision":2,"modifiedAt":"June 1, 2016 4:29 pm","contributors":{}}}],"contributorsAuthor":[],"contributorsPhotographer":[],"_categories":{},"publishHistory":{"entityId":"574f45b0b1a9903a4882779e","revision":0,"pubDate":"May 25, 2017 11:21 am","revisionAuthor":"Charles Truelson","searchable":true,"expired":false,"createdAt":"May 25, 2017 11:21 am","uri":"people/vladimir-putin"},"related":[{}]},"relatedItems":{"items":[{"revisionAuthor":"Katie Commisso","hed":"Papadopoulos Suggests Trump Assented to Campaign Meeting with Putin","promoHed":"Papadopoulos Suggests Trump Assented to Campaign Meeting with Putin","dek":"His lawyers also claim Jeff Sessions supported the plan&amp;#8212;contradicting the attorney general’s statement under oath.","promoDek":"His lawyers also claim Jeff Sessions supported the plan&amp;#8212;contradicting the attorney general’s statement under oath.","body":"&lt;p&gt;In a late-night court filing on Friday, lawyers for former Trump campaign adviser &lt;strong&gt;George Papadopoulos&lt;/strong&gt; publicly contradicted Attorney General &lt;strong&gt;Jeff Sessions’s&lt;/strong&gt; sworn testimony to Congress that neither he nor candidate &lt;strong&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/strong&gt; supported his March 2016 proposal to meet with Russian President &lt;strong&gt;Vladimir Putin.&lt;/strong&gt;  “While some in the room rebuffed George’s offer, Mr. Trump nodded with approval and deferred to Mr. Sessions who appeared to like the idea and stated that the campaign should look into it,” the filing states. “George’s giddiness over Mr. Trump’s recognition was prominent during the days that followed.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The claim could create additional legal headaches for the president and his attorney general. When Sessions was asked about the meeting last year, he claimed that he “pushed back” on the proposal. If Trump did indeed indicate his assent, as Papadopoulos’s filing suggests, it could provide additional ammo to Special Counsel &lt;strong&gt;Robert Mueller,&lt;/strong&gt; who is investigating potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, as well as the president’s alleged efforts to obstruct the probe. Attorneys for Papadopoulos &lt;a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/01/politics/papadopoulos-sessions-putin-campaign-meeting/index.html\"&gt;reportedly&lt;/a&gt; said on Friday that their client had already shared his recollections of the meeting with Mueller.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Papadopoulos was hired to the Trump campaign in March 2016. As part of his plea deal, he admitted to communicating with a &lt;a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-43488581\"&gt;mysterious professor&lt;/a&gt; in the U.K. who traveled in diplomatic circles and claimed that Russia had “dirt” on &lt;strong&gt;Hillary Clinton.&lt;/strong&gt; To prove his worth to the campaign, and fueled by this new knowledge and new Russian-connected contacts, Papadopoulos subsequently offered to broker a meeting between Trump and Putin. “Out of loyalty to the new president and his desire to be part of the administration, he hoisted himself upon his own petard,” Papadopoulos’s lawyers said, acknowledging that he had “lied, minimized, and omitted material facts” to the F.B.I. about the extent of his foreign contacts.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Papadopoulos, who pleaded guilty last year to one count of lying to F.B.I. investigators regarding his contacts with Russian officials, is seeking leniency in sentencing. His lawyers are asking for him to receive the probation that he has already served in the year since his plea last October. Mueller’s team has suggested Papadopoulos serve a custodial six-month sentence, claiming his lies impeded their investigation.&lt;/p&gt;","rubric":"Russia Probe","socialTitle":"Papadopoulos Suggests

And if Trump is Hitler, you’re gonna sort of have to get rid of him.”","body":"&lt;p&gt;As the polls began to close Tuesday, the president’s most vociferous supporters on the far right began to reckon with the prospect of a fearsome new reality: a Democratic House, empowered to launch ceaseless investigations, subpoena Trump associates, and perhaps even file articles of impeachment. “There may be an attempt to impeach, because the base demands it from the Democrats at this point,” predicted &lt;strong&gt;Ben Shapiro,&lt;/strong&gt; the perpetually consternated editor-in-chief of the Daily Wire. “They’ve been talking about how Trump is Hitler. And if Trump is Hitler, you’re gonna sort of have to get rid of him.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Those fears are hardly unfounded. Since &lt;strong&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/strong&gt; took office, in early 2017, congressional Democrats have called for legislative inquiries into myriad alleged misdeeds. They could, for example, subpoena Trump’s tax returns, extract testimony from people involved in the Russia probe, and initiate dozens of committee investigations&amp;#8212;into White House cyber-security practices, Trump’s firing of U.S. attorneys, alleged political interference at the State Department, &lt;strong&gt;Jared Kushner’s&lt;/strong&gt; dubious ethics-law compliance, the administration’s botched response to Hurricane Maria, and on and on. Impeachment isn’t off the table, either, especially if &lt;strong&gt;Robert Mueller&lt;/strong&gt; gives them reason. When two rogue congressmen attempted to file articles of impeachment last year, &lt;strong&gt;Nancy Pelosi&lt;/strong&gt; and Democratic leadership shot them down, in part to keep their powder dry for this very moment. Now, with the gavel back under Democratic control, the political calculus is much different, even if the wave was not as sweeping as people initially predicted. “It’s still a blue wave, even if not a &lt;em&gt;Point Break&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8211;style wave,” a former senior adviser on the Trump campaign told me. “Losing the House, whether by a large or small margin, is huge.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If the far right is worried about the trouble Democrats may stir up, it is because it is intimately familiar with the damage a vengeful congressional majority can do to punish and obstruct the White House. Rep. &lt;strong&gt;Darrell Issa&lt;/strong&gt; was dogged in his pursuit of the Fast and Furious documents, stretching a minor scandal into a major G.O.P. talking point. Republican-controlled House committees oversaw half a dozen separate investigations into the 2012 Benghazi attack, allowing them to publicly grill &lt;strong&gt;Hillary Clinton&lt;/strong&gt; for more than eight hours. (Rep. &lt;strong&gt;Jason Chaffetz,&lt;/strong&gt; then the Oversight Committee chair, was looking forward to investigating Clinton “&lt;a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/house-republicans-are-already-preparing-for-years-of-investigations-of-clinton/2016/10/26/e153a714-9ac3-11e6-9980-50913d68eacb_story.html?utm_term=.376839192535\"&gt;for years&lt;/a&gt;” over the Benghazi attacks if she won the presidency&amp;#8212;alas.) Whatever restraint Democrats might have exercised in a previous era, there will be no partisan goodwill left in Congress by the time Rep. &lt;strong&gt;Elijah Cummings,&lt;/strong&gt; the ranking Democrat on the Oversight Committee, takes over from Rep. &lt;strong&gt;Trey Gowdy.&lt;/strong&gt; (“I am not looking for headlines,” Cummings &lt;a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/03/us/politics/democrats-trump-impeachment.html\"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; in September. “I am going to be defending the truth. We want to look at what is happening under this administration because all of us can agree this is not normal.”)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The sources I spoke with were particularly concerned with the power Democratic Rep. &lt;strong&gt;Adam Schiff,&lt;/strong&gt; the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, would have if he takes over from current chairman &lt;strong&gt;Devin Nunes.&lt;/strong&gt; ”Instead of D.O.J. facing pressure from Nunes and the Freedom Caucus, they’ll have free rein,” predicted &lt;strong&gt;Jack Posobiec,&lt;/strong&gt; a correspondent from One America News Network and a prominent pro-Trump personality on Twitter. “Schiff will be going door-to-door with free copies of the Mueller report like a Jehovah’s Witness once it’s out.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lee Stranahan,&lt;/strong&gt; the former White House reporter for Breitbart, now a host on Sputnik Radio, suggested that Chairman Schiff could pick up where Mueller leaves off, should the special counsel complete his investigation without indicting the president. A continued, Democratic House-led investigation, he said, “serves a lot of the same political purposes [as Mueller], which is the ‘death by a thousand cuts’ thing.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Even so, MAGA-world downplayed the importance of losing the House, given Republican control of the Senate. Especially since so many of Trump’s policy achievements&amp;#8212;cutting regulations, moving the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem, withdrawing from the Paris climate accord and the Iran nuclear deal&amp;#8212;have circumvented the legislative branch. Conservative judicial nominations, which have already been proceeding at a breakneck pace, will continue unabated. “His agenda will founder a little bit, but do I think there will be anything supremely awful for Trump other than just the investigations? Probably not,” said Shapiro, “unless he was planning any sort of big economic push, but he got his tax cuts through already.” Stranahan added that given Trump’s high-profile failures in that chamber, pushing legislation through the House was a lost cause anyways. “It’s not like Trump had a tremendous amount of success with stuff that went through the House apart from the tax thing.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ali Alexander,&lt;/strong&gt; a pro-Trump activist and media celebrity with &lt;a href=\"https://observer.com/2018/10/robert-mercer-bankrolled-pac-ali-alexander/\"&gt;ties&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;strong&gt;Bob Mercer,&lt;/strong&gt; was even less worried, predicting that losing the House might even be a &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; thing for Trump’s chances in 2020. “You’ll have someone to run against,” he explained, noting that the president thrives when he has an established order to smash. Plus, he added, just as Republicans took hard votes on repealing Obamacare, now Democrats would be the ones in the uncomfortable position of having to make politically difficult, and strategically fraught, legislative decisions leading into the next election cycle. “Every Democrat running against him is going to have to take a position on every bill the House considers.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"&gt;&lt;blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/bethanyshondark/status/1060018223435915266\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/bethanyshondark/status/1060018223435915266\"&gt;https://twitter.com/bethanyshondark/status/1060018223435915266&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;And yet, there was a palpable sense of fear that, after two years of wild, Trumpian abandon in Washington, the party might be drawing to an end&amp;#8212;with real legal consequences for anyone who might have broken the rules along the way. Everyone I spoke to expressed worry that other Trump associates would soon be swept up in a super-charged Russia witch hunt. The chief target, according to these people: &lt;strong&gt;Donald Trump Jr.,&lt;/strong&gt; the president’s son and MAGA idol, who took an infamous 2016 meeting with a Kremlin-connected Russian lawyer peddling “dirt” on Clinton. “Schiff wants to fuck Jr.,” said Alexander, suggesting that Donny could soon become a prime target of a Democratic-controlled House Intelligence Committee. Posobiec also offered up another name&amp;#8212;&lt;strong&gt;Roger Stone&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#8212;though he didn’t expect the inquisition would end there. “Me, &lt;strong&gt;Mike Cernovich,&lt;/strong&gt; and Roger Stone can rent a townhouse across from the House Intel Committee and take turns walking over to explain how we had no connections to &lt;strong&gt;[Vladimir] Putin.&lt;/strong&gt;’”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;More Great Stories from &lt;em&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212; Pope vs. Pope: the &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/pope-francis-benedict-conflict-catholic-church?mbid=inline\"&gt;Catholic Church’s civil war&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212; Michael Cohen reveals details about &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/11/michael-cohen-trump-racist-language?mbid=inline\"&gt;Trump’s private racism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212; How MSNBC turned cable news &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/11/how-msnbc-created-a-cable-news-addiction-epidemic?mbid=inline\"&gt;into an addiction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212; Inside the &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/jacob-wohl-robert-mueller-sexual-assault-allegations?mbid=inline\"&gt;fake MAGA intelligence company&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212; Trump’s hapless workday, &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/trump-schedule-executive-time?mbid=inline\"&gt;by the hour&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Looking for more? &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/newsletters\"&gt;Sign up&lt;/a&gt; for our daily Hive newsletter and never miss a story.&lt;/p&gt;","rubric":"2018 Midterm Elections","socialTitle":"“They’ll Have Free Rein”: As Democrats Seize the House, MAGA-Land Predicts Impeachment","socialDescription":"“The base demands it,” says Ben Shapiro. “They’ve been talking about how Trump is Hitler.

And, so more than ever, Trump remains the network’s main programmer.","body":"&lt;p&gt;Shortly before Fox News C.E.O. Roger Ailes was fired, in July 2016, after dozens of women accused him of sexual harassment, he delivered a warning to his boss, Rupert Murdoch. “Trump gets great ratings, but if you’re not careful, he is going to end up totally controlling Fox News,” Ailes said, a source briefed on the conversation recently recalled. “Roger was highly annoyed with Trump. He couldn’t contain him at all,” a high-level Fox staffer remembered.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But now there’s a new boss in charge&amp;#8212;sort of. His name is Lachlan Murdoch. In May, Rupert named Lachlan, his elder son, chairman and C.E.O. of “New Fox,” the slimmed-down parent company that will emerge out of the Murdochs’ $71 billion deal to sell most of their entertainment assets to Disney. Lachlan, 47, is the heir that Rupert most wanted to succeed him even though, of the candidates in the family, Lachlan seemed to want the job least. He’s never been a political junkie like his father, an overt careerist like younger brother James, or a rebellious entrepreneur like older sister Liz. In 2005, Lachlan famously walked away from the company after clashing with Ailes and former C.O.O. Peter Chernin and moved back to the family’s native Australia.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Having returned to the fold, Lachlan has so far been content to be a caretaker rather than an empire builder. Although his nameplate was installed on an office at Fox News several months ago, Lachlan, who ran the &lt;em&gt;New York Post&lt;/em&gt; in the 1990s, mostly is an absentee manager, choosing instead to work from the company’s Los Angeles office. When he occasionally drops in on Fox’s morning editorial meeting, he doesn’t cut a big presence. “He’s polite and asks questions about the news. He’s respectful and comes off as someone trying to learn,” one attendee said. In fact, Lachlan’s highest-profile decision was to hire Donald Trump’s former communications director, Hope Hicks, to be New Fox’s spokesperson. He didn’t know Hicks well&amp;#8212;they had met only a handful of times&amp;#8212;but he was encouraged by Trump and Jared Kushner to hire her. “It seems like he was doing Trump a favor,” one Fox journalist said.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;With Lachlan content to let the Fox News machine run, the hand on the wheel belongs to Fox News C.E.O. Suzanne Scott. Scott’s management style is to effectively let the network’s producers run their shows independently. “No one is in charge,” a former executive told me. Without clear direction from the top, it’s every man for himself.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Fox’s hugely successful alliance with Trump has amplified divisions and rivalries among Fox’s on-air talent. Shepard Smith has emerged as the network’s most visible capital-&lt;em&gt;J&lt;/em&gt;  journalist and quasi-ombudsman. He’s used his three P.M. newscast to debunk Trump conspiracies, like the Uranium One obsession, and give airtime to investigative stories such as &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;’s 14,000-word exposé on Trump’s alleged tax dodging. Sean Hannity has called Smith “clueless” and “so anti-Trump.” At Mar-a-Lago in April, Hannity was overheard trashing Smith to Trump, according to one person familiar with the conversation. “Hannity was denouncing Shep, and Trump was eating it up.” (Hannity denied making the remarks.) Behind the scenes, Smith has taken on a bigger role in shaping Fox’s news coverage and critiques stories he doesn’t like, something that’s rankled some executives. “He’s the one who’s power hungry. He’s trying to pull the place left,” one former executive said. (A Fox News spokesperson disputes this.) Access to Trump also stokes jealousies among hosts. Sources say business anchor Neil Cavuto has complained to colleagues about Lou Dobbs’s closeness with the president. (A Fox News spokesperson says this is “not true.”)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"callout small\" data-type=\"callout\"&gt;&lt;div class=\"embed image row\"&gt;&lt;figure class=\"embedded-image\" data-type=\"image\"&gt;&lt;div class=\"pinterest-link-container\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5bd2305d005a606878515eec/master/h_450,c_limit/cable-news-sherman-dec-2018-embed01.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-pin-desc=\"\" data-pin-credits=\"\"/&gt;&lt;a class=\"pinterest-link\" href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vanityfair.com%2Fnews%2F2018%2F10%2Finside-trumps-new-fox-takeover&amp;amp;media=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.vanityfair.com%2Fphotos%2F5bd2305d005a606878515eec%2Fmaster%2Fh_450%2Cc_limit%2Fcable-news-sherman-dec-2018-embed01.png&amp;amp;description=\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump’s dominance of Fox is partly an accident, as a result of the lack of strong internal leadership. And, of course, in ratings terms, it’s been a happy accident. But the outcome is precisely the one Ailes had warned against: the network’s identity is now inseparable from that of the president, a development that would have surely horrified Ailes. Ailes may have been a right-winger, but he was sophisticated enough to know that Fox needed enough plausible distance from the subjects it covers to maintain the fiction of being “Fair &amp;amp; Balanced.” Now Fox is effectively an arm of the White House. Trump derives “policy” ideas from segments he likes and counts Sean Hannity as one of his closest advisers. The administration can feel like a Fox greenroom on a heavy news day. John Bolton serves as Trump’s national-security adviser; former Fox contributor Ben Carson runs HUD; former &lt;em&gt;Fox &amp;amp; Friends&lt;/em&gt; newsreader Heather Nauert serves as State Department spokesperson; and former Fox president Bill Shine is deputy chief of staff for communications. (Hannity lobbied for him to get the job.) Fox military analyst General Jack Keane has been discussed inside the West Wing as a successor to Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, a former White House official said. One Fox personality literally got into bed with the Trumps: former &lt;em&gt;The Five&lt;/em&gt; co-host Kimberly Guilfoyle is dating Don junior.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For hosts and producers, it’s a strange, though not entirely unfamiliar, environment. Fox hosts regularly get calls from Trump about segments he likes&amp;#8212;or doesn’t. “When you worked at Fox, you knew that at any moment Roger Ailes was watching. Every day was like a job interview with Ailes. Now it’s the same way for Trump,” says a veteran Fox News contributor. According to sources, Trump doesn’t explicitly dictate talking points the way Ailes did, but over time the effect can be similar. “What he usually does is he’ll call after a show and say, ‘I really enjoyed that,’” a former Fox anchor told me. “The highest compliment is ‘I really learned something.’ Then you know he got a new policy idea.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The fact that the news staff knows Trump always could be tuning in means the network is being programmed for an audience of one. “He has the same embattled view as a typical Fox viewer&amp;#8212;that ‘the liberal elites hate me; they’re trying to bring me down,’ ” the former executive said. At times, anchors will use Fox segments to send messages directly to Trump. The day &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reported Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein discussed tape-recording Trump to rally support amongst the Cabinet to invoke the 25th Amendment, Hannity told Trump the article was a trap to bait him into firing Rosenstein.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"callout small\" data-type=\"callout\"&gt;&lt;div class=\"embed image row\"&gt;&lt;figure class=\"embedded-image\" data-type=\"image\"&gt;&lt;div class=\"pinterest-link-container\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5bd2305a7473bd560f08b0ca/master/h_450,c_limit/cable-news-sherman-dec-2018-embed02.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-pin-desc=\"\" data-pin-credits=\"\"/&gt;&lt;a class=\"pinterest-link\" href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vanityfair.com%2Fnews%2F2018%2F10%2Finside-trumps-new-fox-takeover&amp;amp;media=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.vanityfair.com%2Fphotos%2F5bd2305a7473bd560f08b0ca%2Fmaster%2Fh_450%2Cc_limit%2Fcable-news-sherman-dec-2018-embed02.jpg&amp;amp;description=\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"caption callout-image-caption\"&gt;&lt;div class=\"wrapper\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"credits\"&gt;Photo by Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty Images.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rupert Murdoch’s relationship with Trump, and his network’s importance in maintaining the protective bubble of propaganda around the president, is one of some irony. Murdoch has wanted a personal relationship with an American president ever since he decamped from London to New York, in the 1970s (he was not particularly close with George W. Bush, the last Republican to hold the office). With Trump, he’s achieved that goal&amp;#8212;though he has told friends he thinks Trump is a “buffoon” and his strongest personal allegiances (much like Trump’s, actually) are to the elites that Trump uses as his whipping boys. But Murdoch prizes profits above ideology, so he accommodated Trump in order to preserve access. Before the inauguration, I reported that Trump asked Murdoch to submit names for the position of F.C.C. commissioner. (Murdoch denied it at the time.)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The question for Lachlan going forward is the same one that has vexed the Republican Party in the age of Trump: when to break from Trump, if a divorce is even possible. At moments there have been frays in the bond, as when Trump doted on Vladimir Putin in Helsinki (Neil Cavuto called it “disgusting”) or attacked Brett Kavanaugh’s accuser Dr. Christine Blasey Ford (a &lt;em&gt;Fox &amp;amp; Friends&lt;/em&gt; host said Trump “chose to blow it”). This fall, panic swept through Fox’s executive ranks as it looked like Democrats had a chance to retake both the House and the Senate. “They are deathly afraid of the Dems taking the House,” one high-level staffer said. The fear, according to the staffer, is that congressional committees investigating the Trump White House could draw in Fox. “Fox is hiring lobbyists to prepare,” the staffer said. Ominously for both Fox and the president, Trump’s rallies are not drawing the numbers they once did. As Politico reported, a Trump rally on August 30, carried live in Tucker Carlson’s regular prime-time slot, drew only 2.5 million viewers, whereas Carlson had been averaging more than 2.8 million. More recently, as Trump has been barnstorming ahead of the midterms, Fox has only been dipping into his rallies.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But mostly, Fox doesn’t have much of a choice when it comes to Trump. And why not? On the day Kavanaugh shouted his way through his Senate Judiciary Committee testimony, Fox attracted a near-record 5.7 million viewers&amp;#8212;more than MSNBC and CNN combined.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;More from our Special Report on the State of Cable News:&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212; How MSNBC gamified &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/11/how-msnbc-created-a-cable-news-addiction-epidemic\"&gt;cable news into addiction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212; Inside CNN’s massive &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/11/inside-the-trump-gold-rush-at-cnn\"&gt;Trump gold rush&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"embed cneembed\"&gt;&lt;div class=\"embed block cneembed\" data-url=\"//player.cnevids.com/script/video/5bbe9f3a625710412d00003b.js?muted=1\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;","rubric":"From the Magazine","socialTitle":"“No One Is in Charge”: Inside Trump’s New Fox Takeover","socialDescription":"Lachlan Murdoch, now installed at Fox News, is a caretaker rather than an empire builder.

Illegal crossings have &lt;a href=\"https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/sw-border-migration\"&gt;increased&lt;/a&gt; to the highest level since 2016, straining Customs and Border Protection resources. And so, in the weeks before midterms, the president evidently thought it prudent to dial up his anti-immigration rhetoric. On Saturday, he &lt;a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/trump-suggests-support-family-separations-after-earlier-practice-caused-outcry-n919866\"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; reporters that he was of a mind to reinstate a variation on his controversial child-separation policy, claiming it would dissuade asylum-seekers coming north from Central America. “They use children. In many cases, the children aren’t theirs. They grab ‘em, and they want to come in with children,” he said. “If they feel there will be separation, they won’t come.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As ever, it is hard to discern exactly what Trump is thinking. During a wide-ranging &lt;a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/donald-trump-interview-60-minutes-full-transcript-lesley-stahl-jamal-khashoggi-james-mattis-brett-kavanaugh-vladimir-putin-2018-10-14/\"&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; with CBS’s &lt;em&gt;60 minutes,&lt;/em&gt; which aired on Sunday, Trump told &lt;strong&gt;Lesley Stahl&lt;/strong&gt; that his previous policy had been “the same as the Obama law,” but then quickly shifted gears into defending family separation. Asked whether he was toying with the idea of reinstating the policy, Trump equivocated: “There have to be consequences, Lesley, for coming into our country illegally. And part of the reason, I have to blame myself, the economy is so strong that everybody wants to come into the United States.” Stahl pressed on:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stahl:&lt;/em&gt; Are you willing to reinstitute that policy? You said, “We’re looking at everything.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Trump:&lt;/em&gt; I will&amp;#8212;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stahl:&lt;/em&gt; Yes or no.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Trump:&lt;/em&gt; I will only&amp;#8212;I can’t&amp;#8212;you can’t say yes or no. What I can say is this: there are consequences from coming into a country, namely our country, illegally.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To be fair, Trump has something of a habit of getting out ahead of his own White House’s policy framework. But in this case, it appears he’s not just blowing hot air: his comments this weekend followed a Friday &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/immigration/trump-administration-weighs-new-family-separation-effort-at-border/2018/10/12/45895cce-cd7b-11e8-920f-dd52e1ae4570_story.html\"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; that the White House is weighing various plans that could again split parents from their children at the border. One option under consideration, according to several sources, is the “binary choice” option, wherein parents would be given the choice to either stay with their children in detention after 20 days, or to allow their kids to be moved to a government shelter. Other tabled suggestions reportedly include enabling courts to process cases faster, and extending the legal amount of time a child can be detained to more than 20 days (already, there are numerous reports of detentions lasting far beyond this limit).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Reinstating child separation in any form will expose Trump to significant domestic and international opprobrium, even from allies such as the U.K. (which quietly practices its own form of family separation under the Home Office hostile environment policy). The White House would also face significant logistical challenges if it wishes to avoid the chaos of attempting to reunite families under the time pressure of a court order, without the help of a unified, cohesive system. There is also a lack of space to house many more detained immigrants, as highlighted by a recent report that, &lt;a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/30/us/migrant-children-tent-city-texas.html\"&gt;under cover of darkness&lt;/a&gt;, federal authorities have been transporting hundreds of children from their overcrowded accommodation to a makeshift tented town in Texas.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But none of this seems to bother the president who, riding high on the successful implementation of U.S.M.C.A., and the confirmation of &lt;strong&gt;Brett Kavanaugh&lt;/strong&gt; to the Supreme Court, appeared &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/donald-trump-60-minutes-interview\"&gt;more convinced than ever&lt;/a&gt; of his own righteousness during Sunday’s sit-down. “I’m not a baby&amp;#8212;I know these things,” he boasted to Stahl at one point, in reference to the possible ill-will that North Korea’s leader, with whom Trump has said he’s “fallen in love,” could hold toward the U.S. (He reiterated the phrase minutes later, this time to assure Stahl that he did not trust every aide employed in the White House.)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Indeed, though the &lt;em&gt;Post&lt;/em&gt; reported that some officials say they are “not planning” to revive the forced separations of May and June, others, like hard-liner &lt;strong&gt;Stephen Miller,&lt;/strong&gt; are driving the process forward, convinced that the policy “worked as an effective deterrent to illegal crossings.” Not only has Trump apparently bought the message, but in one fell swoop he’s disposed of the pretense that the policy was ever intended otherwise, as Attorney General &lt;strong&gt;Jeff Sessions&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2018/06/19/here-are-the-administration-officials-who-have-said-that-family-separation-is-meant-as-a-deterrent/\"&gt;argued&lt;/a&gt; when it was first instated. “Frankly, when you . . . allow the parents to stay together,” he told Stahl, “then what happens is people are gonna pour into our country.”&lt;/p&gt;","rubric":"Immigration","socialTitle":"Trump Never Stopped Believing in His Child-Separation Policy","socialDescription":"Trump appears newly emboldened to reinstate his

Obama is writing, rallying, and still waiting on a more appealing counter-narrative for the country.","body":"&lt;p&gt;He is as cool as ever&amp;#8212;the Mr. Spock of modern American politics, a man who can do the split-fingered Vulcan salute and intone “Live long and prosper,” a tribute to the television series that “Barry” Obama first watched growing up in Honolulu more than half a century ago. To visitors and staffers who call on him in his Washington offices, in the West End section of the capital, near Georgetown, the former president’s conversations are thoughtful and wide-ranging. As he works on his much-anticipated memoir (there is no firm publication date), he is able to toggle between timelines, free to choose among stories from his campaigning days for the Senate in downstate Illinois to Iowa vote totals, or from American demography to the state of global democracy. In his off-duty wardrobe of jeans and a casual shirt, a go-cup of tea at hand, still graying subtly but surely, and looking even leaner than in his White House days, he tends to take the longest of views on the state of the nation since his successor assumed power. Recently, he has sagely remarked to those who ask, worriedly, about the Age of Trump: “Things are never as good as we think when they’re going well, and never as bad as we think when they aren’t.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Barack Hussein Obama has been like this forever: unflappable when everyone else is flapping wildly, reasonable in a swirl of passion. &lt;em&gt;Ten&lt;/em&gt; years ago this month, he was elected as the 44th president of the United States, a moment more than a few Americans had not believed they would live to see. In the weeks after Obama defeated John McCain, in 2008, I asked George H. W. Bush if he had thought an African-American could win the presidency in his own lifetime. “No, I didn’t,” Bush 41 replied. “But then I met him, and I totally get how &lt;em&gt;he&lt;/em&gt; did.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And therein lies a fundamental element of the Obama story: he is the particular that made the general possible. There is an ancient debate about the relative role of human agency in history&amp;#8212;a fancy way of speculating about whether events are shaped more by broad forces (demography, economics, geography) or by the characters and characteristics of individual leaders at a given moment. The answer is usually mixed, but there’s no doubt that, say, Abraham Lincoln’s political gifts and moral compass enabled him to save the Union when others might have failed. Or that Franklin D. Roosevelt’s complexities informed his ability to rescue capitalism and lead a reluctant nation to global responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;These are early days for a historical verdict on Barack Obama. But it seems safe to say that his background&amp;#8212;as a child raised in Hawaii, the son of a white mother and a Kenyan father, together with the hyper-vigilant care with which he approached the task of living a life balancing disparate traditions, influences, and worldviews&amp;#8212;was critical to his rise to the pinnacle of American power. Never a candidate of grievance, he won majorities in two national elections by appealing to the future, not by exploiting the past or by fueling familiar culture wars.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Obama has always led a charmed political life. Though the young state senator’s credit card was rejected when he tried to rent a car while attending the 2000 Democratic National Convention, in Los Angeles, things quickly turned in his favor. Four years later, political opponents in Illinois imploded all around him, opening a path to the U.S. Senate. (A rival for the Democratic nomination was accused of physically assaulting his ex-wife, and the Republican nominee dropped out after &lt;em&gt;his&lt;/em&gt; former wife said that he’d asked her to accompany him to sex clubs. Both candidates denied the allegations.) And four years after &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;, during the presidential campaign, the Great Recession erupted on the Republicans’ watch, and fate helped hand the orator, conciliator, and hope-and-change nominee a landmark victory&amp;#8212;not once but twice.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Ten years on, consumed as we are by Trump, the start of the Obama era can feel as remote as Agincourt. Did we really have a dignified, contemplative, judicious, diplomatic, African-American president less than 24 months ago? We did, and now we don’t. Indeed, the current president’s persona, his impulse to repeal, and his rash of executive orders have had the strange effect of dismantling Obama’s policy legacy while ensuring his cultural one as a gentlemanly, eloquent president in a Hobbesian reality-TV world.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And that’s the kind of historical irony that Obama keenly appreciates. The American story&amp;#8212;and Obama &lt;em&gt;loves&lt;/em&gt; thinking in terms of story&amp;#8212;is one of perpetual progress and reaction, followed by more of the same, world without end. It is Obama who has long insisted that Americans focus on the Founders’ understanding of the national mission as a journey to a “more perfect Union,” not a perfect one. Informed by this Niebuhrian vision of politics as a tragic undertaking&amp;#8212;the country will never be all we want it to be, and our moral duty is to endure in the hope that our better angels will prevail&amp;#8212;Obama is perhaps the American most equipped to put the rise of nativism, xenophobia, propaganda, and fear in the broadest of contexts.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Framing our own moment of fear was one of his goals on a summer trip to Africa to deliver a lecture in honor of Nelson Mandela. Describing the backlash to globalization in recent years, Obama acknowledged the American and European movements that have “tapped the unease that was felt by many people who lived outside of the urban cores, fears that economic security was slipping away, that their social status and privileges were eroding, that their cultural identities were being threatened by outsiders, somebody that didn’t look like them or sound like them or pray as they did.” That he was speaking the same week that Trump was roiling the NATO summit, and holding a bizarrely buddy-like press conference with Vladimir Putin in Helsinki, gave particular force to Obama’s words about America’s need to lead against strongman politics&amp;#8212;and the “bigger and bigger lies” of authoritarians.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;He also made a special plea for the straightforward role of fact in public life. “Too much of politics today seems to reject the very concept of objective truth,” Obama said. “We see the utter loss of shame among political leaders where they’re caught in a lie and they just double down and they lie some more.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Lately, Obama has been out making the rounds, rallying voters before the midterms. “There’s always been [a] darker aspect to America’s story,” he insisted in a September speech in Illinois. “It did not start with Donald Trump.” He continued along these lines the next day, in California: “When you look at the arc of American history, there’s always been a push and pull . . . between those who promote the politics of hope and those who exploit the politics of fear.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"callout large has-pullquote\" data-type=\"callout\"&gt;&lt;div class=\"embed pullquote\" data-type=\"pullquote\"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A night owl, he writes his first drafts in longhand, staying up into\nthe early hours of the morning.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"component-social-share pullquote mono closed\" data-component=\"SocialShare\" role=\"list\"&gt;&lt;div class=\"share-item twitter\" data-component=\"twitter\" data-href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=%22%0AA%20night%20owl%2C%20he%20writes%20his%20first%20drafts%20in%20longhand%2C%20staying%20up%20into%0Athe%20early%20hours%20of%20the%20morning.%0A%0A%22&amp;amp;via=VanityFair&amp;amp;url=\" role=\"listitem\"&gt;&lt;a aria-label=\"Tweet\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=%22%0AA%20night%20owl%2C%20he%20writes%20his%20first%20drafts%20in%20longhand%2C%20staying%20up%20into%0Athe%20early%20hours%20of%20the%20morning.%0A%0A%22&amp;amp;via=VanityFair&amp;amp;url=\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"icon\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"label\"&gt;Twitter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the most part, however, Obama has been living his days outside the constant oompah of the national circus. He is deeply engaged in planning his presidential library, due to open in Chicago in several years. His foundation is focused on grassroots organizing and leadership at home and abroad. (The prevailing descriptor is “civic innovation.”) He and Michelle have signed a whopping deal to develop content for Netflix. And with the former First Lady’s memoir, &lt;em&gt;Becoming&lt;/em&gt;, out this month, her husband, in his private hours, is focused on &lt;em&gt;his&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A night owl, he writes his first drafts in longhand, staying up late into the evening and early hours of the morning. He mostly works in a sparsely decorated study in the Obamas’ house in the Kalorama section of Washington, D.C., and in his wood-paneled West End office, where he’ll put an old LP on his Shinola record player while he’s working. (Otis Redding, Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder, Bruce Springsteen, and Duke Ellington are the usual suspects, with some Brandi Carlile, Leon Bridges, and Kendrick Lamar thrown in.) As staffers are busy doing research and interviewing former Cabinet members and senior officials to help jog his memory, he mainly sits alone, drafting one sentence, then another.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Obama’s personal answer to our current plight? Tell a better story. Insist on a more appealing counter-narrative. And follow his wife’s counsel to go high when they&amp;#8212;meaning Trump&amp;#8212;go low. Obama believes in this rhetorical prescription to his core. And why shouldn’t he? He mastered American politics by telling his own story, and Trump rose to high office by telling a different one. Democracies are by nature emotional entities, and it’s not much of a reach to think that historians will see the Obama-Trump pivot as the starkest of examples of the competing American narratives of hope and of fear.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In Africa, Obama spoke plainly. “Let me tell you what I believe,” he said. “I believe in a vision of equality and justice and freedom and multi-racial democracy, built on the premise that all people are created equal, and they’re endowed by our creator with certain inalienable rights. And I believe that a world governed by such principles is possible and that it can achieve more peace and more cooperation in pursuit of a common good. That’s what I believe.” It’s his story, and he’s sticking to it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Presidential historian Jon Meacham is the author of&lt;/em&gt; The Soul of America &lt;em&gt;(Random House).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","rubric":"From the Magazine","socialTitle":"Obama Would Appreciate the Irony: Jon Meacham on the Competing American Stories of Trump and His

harshest measures taken against the country was apparently an accident.","body":"&lt;p&gt;Since entering office 83 lifetimes ago, &lt;strong&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/strong&gt; has shown Russian President &lt;strong&gt;Vladimir Putin&lt;/strong&gt; a sort of slobbering canine loyalty generally reserved for the special relationship between a golden retriever and its master. In that time, he’s &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/11/trump-intel-slip\"&gt;leaked&lt;/a&gt; confidential information about a classified Israeli intelligence operation to two Russian enjoys; &lt;a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/12/world/europe/uk-russia-spy-poisoning.html\"&gt;hesitated&lt;/a&gt; to blame the Kremlin for quite obviously poisoning an ex-Russian spy; flipped out when he &lt;a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/trump-a-reluctant-hawk-has-battled-his-top-aides-on-russia-and-lost/2018/04/15/a91e850a-3f1b-11e8-974f-aacd97698cef_story.html\"&gt;learned&lt;/a&gt; that the U.S. had kicked out more Russian diplomats than European countries following the incident; called Putin to congratulate him on his not-at-all sham of an election victory against the &lt;a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/3/21/17147684/do-not-congratulate-trump-putin\"&gt;express wishes of senior aides&lt;/a&gt;; assured Russia that plans for sanctions &lt;em&gt;announced by his own U.N. ambassador&lt;/em&gt; were &lt;a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-russia-sanctions-nikki-haley-us-ambassador-un-president-new-york-a8312816.html\"&gt;never gonna happen&lt;/a&gt;; requested that Russia be let back into the G7 after it was kicked out for invading another European country; and &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/07/donald-trump-vladimir-putin-helsinki-summit\"&gt;literally sided with Putin&lt;/a&gt; over U.S. intelligence agencies during their little summit in Helsinki. Knowing how he feels about the guy, it came as something of a shock when Trump’s Treasury Department sanctioned Russian billionaire &lt;strong&gt;Oleg Deripaska&lt;/strong&gt; and his aluminum company Rusal back in April, one of the harshest measures taken against Mother Russia during Trump’s tenure, and one that &lt;a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/09/moscow-calls-sanctions-absolutely-illegal-as-russian-markets-tumble.html\"&gt;baffled&lt;/a&gt; analysts, as the punishment “seem[ed] disconnected with the actions and words coming from the president.” The sanctions make a lot more sense, though, given the revelation on Wednesday that they were all a big mistake, and only happened thanks to a f--k up on Treasury Secretary &lt;strong&gt;Steven Mnuchin’s&lt;/strong&gt; part. Per &lt;a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/steven-mnuchin-accidentally-sanctioned-putin-oligarch-oleg-deripaska\"&gt;the Daily Beast&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;At a Capitol Hill hearing in January, as lawmakers were hounding him about the Trump administration’s slow implementation of mandatory sanctions against Russia, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin was backed into a corner.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And he blurted out something he would come to regret&amp;#8212;by accident, the Daily Beast has learned.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;“There will be sanctions that come out of this report,” Mnuchin said&amp;#8212;a surprise statement, because while Congress had ordered the department to create a report on Russian oligarchs, it didn’t require that any sanctions be imposed based on it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Mnuchin’s slip-up forced Treasury officials to scramble to come up with a plan that would match the secretary’s under-oath statement, according to four congressional sources directly involved in the sanctions process. . . . According to those sources, Treasury broke protocol and did not coordinate closely with other departments to properly scrutinize Deripaska and evaluate the impact of the sanctions&amp;#8212;which roiled global markets and caused aluminum prices to skyrocket, mainly affecting U.S. partners in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, given Putin’s anger over the actions and Trump’s affinity for the guy, Mnuchin has since walked back the sanctions, &lt;a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/27/politics/mnuchin-russia-sanctions-rusal/index.html\"&gt;promising&lt;/a&gt; that the measures can be lifted, and &lt;a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/27/politics/mnuchin-russia-sanctions-rusal/index.html\"&gt;claiming&lt;/a&gt; in an interview that “The objective was to impact the oligarchs, not to impact the hardworking people of Rusal as a result.” By pure coincidence, Deripaska, who is currently awaiting trial for a cornucopia of financial crimes relating to his work for the Ukraine, has ties to former Trump campaign manager &lt;strong&gt;Paul Manafort,&lt;/strong&gt; who might also &lt;a

I know these things.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;At that point, he was referring to Stahl’s observation that &lt;strong&gt;Kim Jong Un,&lt;/strong&gt; whom Trump said he “fell in love” with, was a murderous dictator with countless atrocities in his history. But it also could have referred to the extended victory lap he has been running ever since he clinched a new trade deal and the confirmation of &lt;strong&gt;Brett Kavanaugh,&lt;/strong&gt; neither of which has moderated his conviction that he is presiding over the most consequential presidency in history, the protestations of his critics be damned. Trump, after all, appears to have learned that there is no benefit to be gained from modesty or regret. When Stahl asked if Trump could think of any “mistakes” he had made thus far, he could only cite his failure not to enact his agenda faster.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Indeed, with 23 days left until a midterm election that threatens his hold on Congress, Trump refused even to acknowledge the universe of alternative facts and negative polling that threatens his presidency. “I’m not going to get into it because we won,” he said at one point, cutting off Stahl when she asked why he had mocked Dr. &lt;strong&gt;Christine Blasey Ford,&lt;/strong&gt; the woman who accused Kavanaugh of sexual assault, when he could have taken the opportunity to try to unify a divided country. “It doesn’t matter,” he finally explained, exasperated, after first trying to deny the premise. “We won.” (Kavanaugh denied all allegations of sexual misconduct.)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Why was he not tougher on &lt;strong&gt;Vladimir Putin,&lt;/strong&gt; for instance? “I think I’m very tough with him personally,” he claimed, saying Putin “probably” ordered assassinations and poisonings and interfered with the 2016 election. “But I think China meddled too,” he added. (“This is amazing. You are diverting the whole Russia thing,” Stahl responded.)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And what about separating children from their undocumented families at the border, an unpopular policy that he enforced, only backing down under public pressure? “You know, &lt;strong&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/strong&gt; had the same thing,” he said, bulldozing over the fact that Obama never enforced it. “And frankly, when you don’t do separa&amp;#8212; when you allow the parents to stay together, O.K., when you allow that, then what happens is people are going to pour into our country.” He refused to say whether that meant he would reinstate the policy: “I will only&amp;#8212;I can’t&amp;#8212;you can’t say yes or no. What I can say is this: there are consequences from coming into a country, namely our country, illegally.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And in the middle of Trump’s boast about threatening to withdraw from NATO, and leveraging tariffs on those European allies in retaliation, he stomped on his secretary of defense, &lt;strong&gt;James Mattis,&lt;/strong&gt; for reportedly warning him that the 70-year-old alliance was the only thing preventing World War III. “Frankly, I like General Mattis. I think I know more about it than he does. And I know more about it from the standpoint of fairness, that I can tell you.” (He later hinted that Mattis might leave the White House, calling him “a bit of a Democrat.”)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;With roughly three weeks left until the midterms, Trump’s insistent salesmanship appeared to be strategic: the Democrats have made this election a referendum on Trump’s presidency, a message that the Republicans, too, have happily embraced. The Kavanaugh debacle provided a much-needed jolt to their electorate, in that it bolstered the argument that the Democrats would do anything to undermine Trump, a message repeated by Trump himself during his innumerable rallies across the country over the past few weeks. To that end, Trump’s &lt;em&gt;60 Minutes&lt;/em&gt; interview was not about him engaging in his civic duty to submit to the occasional tough interview, but rather an opportunity to remind his base why they elected him: to make America great by humiliating its elites, including his very interviewer that night. “Lesley, it’s O.K.,” he smirked, as she repeatedly tried to pin him down on several topics. “In the meantime, I’m president&amp;#8212;and you’re not.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;CORRECTION: This article has been updated to reflect the correct spelling of Lesley

remaining until the election, Georgia gubernatorial candidate &lt;strong&gt;Brian Kemp,&lt;/strong&gt; who also happens to be the state official in charge of election integrity, announced an investigation into his opponent. “AFTER FAILED HACKING ATTEMPT, SOS LAUNCHES INVESTIGATION INTO GEORGIA DEMOCRATIC PARTY,” his office &lt;a href=\"http://sos.ga.gov/index.php/general/after_failed_hacking_attempt_sos_launches_investigation_into_georgia_democratic_party_\"&gt;declared&lt;/a&gt; in an all-caps banner headline on its Web site. “Federal partners,” the press statement continued, “including the Department of Homeland Security and Federal Bureau of Investigation, were immediately alerted.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Kemp is facing off against Democrat &lt;strong&gt;Stacey Abrams&lt;/strong&gt; in what has become one of the country’s &lt;a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2018/governor/ga/georgia_governor_kemp_vs_abrams-6628.html\"&gt;closest&lt;/a&gt;, most &lt;a href=\"http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/10/kemp-lies-about-abrams-lying-about-kemp-lies-on-health-care.html\"&gt;contentious&lt;/a&gt; contests. Perhaps more important, the Kemp-Abrams race has provided an early preview of what could become an even more contentious post-election debate over whether the midterms&amp;#8212;comprising thousands of state and local races across the country&amp;#8212;were legitimate. To be sure, the months leading up to the midterms have been rife with bona fide warnings about election meddling. Federal authorities have identified “more than 160 reports” of meddling since the beginning of August alone, &lt;em&gt;The Boston Globe&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2018/11/04/hackers-targeting-election-networks-across-country-lead-midterms/d0EzG4Cmh2jeMqllhXo4WP/story.html\"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; Monday, and a handful of the hacking attempts in several states appear to be connected. But Kemp’s eleventh-hour push shows that the psychological wounds from 2016 run much deeper. Voters, it seems, are only too ready to doubt the integrity of the U.S. electoral system&amp;#8212;even when there’s no evidence of interference at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, fake election-hacking claims may be even more damaging to voter confidence than real ones. As &lt;strong&gt;Zeynep Tufekci&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/03/opinion/midterm-election-hacked.html\"&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt; in a recent &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; column, “The legitimacy of an election depends on the electorate accepting that it was fair, that everyone who tried to vote got to vote and that every vote counted. Lose that, and your voting system might as well have suffered a devastating technological attack.” In the wake of the 2016 election, in other words, it won’t take much to make voters second-guess a system that promised &lt;strong&gt;Hillary Clinton&lt;/strong&gt; and then delivered &lt;strong&gt;Donald Trump.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Already, there are signs that foreign entities are ready to take advantage. Sources at “leading tech companies” told &lt;a href=\"https://www.axios.com/latest-election-scare-false-claims-of-interference-373d1db3-e1a8-4137-a8ca-6651e11c0322.html\"&gt;Axios&lt;/a&gt; on Monday that bad actors are primed to spread false claims of interference. As evidence, they pointed to a video, posted late in October and picked up by a few sites including &lt;a href=\"https://thinkprogress.org/russian-social-media-troll-youtube-twitter-4600e8d2a6b7/\"&gt;ThinkProgress&lt;/a&gt;, in which someone who claimed to be a Russian troll-farm whistleblower “confessed” to contributing to social-media interference in 2016. YouTube pulled the video before it could spread any further, but the hoax prompted a fresh wave of warnings. “You have to be super careful with anything said by an admitted member of a ‘disinformation factory,’” former Facebook security officer &lt;strong&gt;Alex Stamos&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/alexstamos/status/1057424043643625472\"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; last week, in the wake of the video’s spread. “That includes things that would seem like admissions of guilt.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Although there’s evidence that confidence in America’s electoral system has been in decline &lt;a href=\"https://www.vox.com/polyarchy/2018/3/9/17100108/2018-midterms-legitimacy-crisis\"&gt;since 2000&lt;/a&gt;, the current crisis is inseparable from the toxic stew of misinformation and suspicion surrounding the election of Donald Trump. Before the 2016 election, Trump warned that the race was “rigged,” and suggested it would be stolen; after he was elected, and Democrats accused the Russians of tipping the scales, Trump declared that Russia had nothing to do with it. All the while, G.O.P. leaders have essentially &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/07/white-house-weather-fake-news\"&gt;warned&lt;/a&gt; their constituents not to believe what they read (“What you’re seeing and what you’re reading is not what’s happening,” Trump memorably told a crowd at a Veterans Day event). The result is a political and media environment in which both Republicans and Democrats are primed to believe allegations of meddling, depending on their political biases, even as the White House has largely &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/07/how-trump-let-putin-win-the-cyber-security-war\"&gt;dropped the ball&lt;/a&gt; when it comes to cyber-security.

This fact is now &lt;a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/07/16/us/elections/russian-interference-statements-comments.html\"&gt;widely accepted&lt;/a&gt; by the C.I.A., the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the F.B.I., the N.S.A., the Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security, the House Intelligence Committee, the Senate Intelligence Committee, and anyone with a moderate grasp on reality. To dispute it is like disputing the fact that water is wet or that &lt;strong&gt;Don Jr.&lt;/strong&gt; spends long hours flexing in the mirror and asking his reflection, “You like that?” And yet, there is still one person who does, and his name is &lt;strong&gt;Donald Trump.&lt;/strong&gt; The president’s refusal to accept the obvious was underscored in July when, at a press conference in Helsinki, he &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/07/donald-trump-vladimir-putin-helsinki-summit\"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; reporters that he took the word of one &lt;strong&gt;Vladimir Putin&lt;/strong&gt; that Mother Russia is being strung up on false charges over the findings of his own U.S. intelligence agencies. But in a total 180 at the U.N. on Wednesday, the president was suddenly &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; worried about election meddling&amp;#8212;just not by Russia, &lt;a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/without-evidence-trump-accuses-china-of-interfering-in-us-midterm-elections/2018/09/26/c0069910-c19d-11e8-b338-a3289f6cb742_story.html\"&gt;which in his mind remains unimpeachable&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Trump on Wednesday directly accused China of interfering in the U.S. midterm elections this fall in retaliation for the ongoing trade war between Washington and Beijing, marking a new front in the deepening hostilities that have threatened to upend bilateral relations.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The president made the allegation during his opening remarks at a U.N. Security Council meeting on nonproliferation, asserting that China “has been attempting to interfere in our upcoming 2018 election, coming up in November, against my administration. They do not want me or us to win because I am the first president to ever challenge China on trade, and we are winning on trade&amp;#8212;we are winning on every level. We don’t want to them to meddle or interfere in our upcoming election.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Trump presented no evidence for his claims, and his top national security advisers told reporters in August they had not found specific examples of interference ahead of the midterms from countries other than Russia, though they warned it remained a possibility. In his remarks at the Security Council meeting, Trump made no mention of Russian interference.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Later, during a press call that was arranged at the last minute on the topic of “Chinese interference,” a senior administration official backed up the president’s claims with . . . zero examples, other than the fact that China has “hurt farmers and workers in states and districts that voted for the president because he stood up to the ways China has taken advantage of our country economically.” That’s actually true! China has hit soybean farmers with tariffs that are cutting into their profits, a direct result of Trump‘s decision to hit Beijing in an increasingly escalating trade war that seems to have no end in sight. It clearly did so to put pressure on Trump to back off from his trade policies that are hurting both nations, knowing that squeezing his base would put him in a tough position politically. (The European Union, Canada, and Mexico have taken similar tacks, retaliating with levies affecting products from Wisconsin and Kentucky.) You know what that doesn’t constitute? Election meddling. “China has all along followed the principle of non-interference in other countries’ domestic affairs,” Chinese Foreign Minister &lt;strong&gt;Wang Yi&lt;/strong&gt; said at the U.N. following Trump’s declaration. “We did not and will not interfere in any country’s domestic affairs. We refuse to accept any unwarranted accusations against China.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;While most of the insane things that come out of Trump’s mouth seem to tumble randomly and without pre-meditation, the claim that China is actively interfering in midterm elections may actually be part of a strategy the administration has been cooking up for some time. Sources told Axios &lt;a href=\"https://www.axios.com/trump-administration-anti-china-campaign-2c17776d-ad80-4a79-b6a7-912927059833.html\"&gt;late last week&lt;/a&gt; that the West Wing had plans to “launch a major, ‘administration-wide’ broadside against China,” and that it’s “not just going to let Russia be the bogeyman.” In which case, you might think that the White House would’ve come up with some talking points for Trump to use at his press conference later that day, other than, basically, “I hear things” and “I have evidence but I can’t tell you,” which is exactly what he said, in addition to telling reporters that Beijing is allegedly in awe of his formidable intellect.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"&gt;&lt;blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/atrupar/status/1045062393263534081\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/atrupar/status/1045062393263534081\"&gt;https://twitter.com/atrupar/status/1045062393263534081&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you would like to receive the Levin Report in your inbox daily, &lt;a href=\"http://tinyletter.com/besslevin\"&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt; to subscribe.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Just to close the loop on that press conference . . .&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In addition to China, President Big Brain covered a &lt;em&gt;wide&lt;/em&gt; range of topics, including but not limited to &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/davidcicilline/status/1045077036707008514\"&gt;his bromance with &lt;strong&gt;Kim Jong Un&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the true victims of the #MeToo movement (&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/keithboykin/status/1045077311425589248\"&gt;men like him&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/bkurbs/status/1045075607996923905\"&gt;the various ways he likes to model his pressers after &lt;strong&gt;Elton John&lt;/strong&gt; concerts&lt;/a&gt;), and how Democrats would pull the same s--t they’re pulling with &lt;strong&gt;Brett Kavanaugh&lt;/strong&gt; if the Founding Father was also accused of sexual assault, which Trump is pretty sure was in fact the case:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"&gt;&lt;blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/ABC/status/1045069534158368771\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/ABC/status/1045069534158368771\"&gt;https://twitter.com/ABC/status/1045069534158368771&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ford: Trump tariffs would cost us $1 billion, with a ‘b’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Nothing to see here, just Trump’s trade war &lt;a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ford-motor-tariffs/trump-metals-tariffs-will-cost-ford-1-billion-in-profits-ceo-says-idUSKCN1M61ZN\"&gt;continuing&lt;/a&gt; to do great things for U.S. companies:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;“From Ford’s perspective the metals tariffs took about $1 billion in profit from us,” C.E.O. &lt;strong&gt;James Hackett&lt;/strong&gt; said at a Bloomberg conference in New York, “The irony of which is we source most of that in the U.S. today anyway.

According to Trump, it wasn’t the utterly humiliating experience it appeared to be be.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;“The fake news said people laughed at President Trump. They didn’t laugh at me,” he said Wednesday. “They weren’t laughing at me, they were laughing with me,” Trump added. “We had fun. That was not laughing at me. People had a good time with me. We were doing it together. We had a good time. They respect what I’ve done.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;President finds time to slam Federal Reserve during busy day of smearing sexual assault victims&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;How &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; he do it? &lt;a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-26/trump-slams-fed-hours-after-his-pick-powell-lifts-interest-rates\"&gt;Per Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;“We are doing great as a country,” Trump said Wednesday at a press conference in New York. “Unfortunately they just raised interest rates a little bit because we are doing so well. I am not happy about that.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The president’s latest comments expanded on interviews, Twitter comments, and a private speech over the past three months when Trump has said he was not happy with rate hikes, breaking with a more than two-decade-old norm of presidents avoiding comments on monetary policy out of respect for the Fed’s independence.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Goldman Sachs junior bankers are practically on food stamps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And by food stamps we mean they’re

Season 6 flounders.","body":"&lt;h2&gt;This post contains plot details for the entirety of &lt;em&gt;House of Cards&lt;/em&gt; Season 6.&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For a show built on the premise that people will abandon their values at the slightest hint of personal gain, credit must be given to how swiftly &lt;em&gt;House of Cards,&lt;/em&gt; offscreen, handled the growing number of accusations of sexual misconduct against its star &lt;strong&gt;Kevin Spacey&lt;/strong&gt; last year. (Spacey has apologized to actor &lt;strong&gt;Anthony Rapp,&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/11/kevin-spacey-evaluation-treatment-allegations\"&gt;sought treatment&lt;/a&gt; in the wake of further allegations.) Production was suspended, and a few days later, Spacey was fired. Season 6 was announced to be the show’s last. It was convenient that before Spacey’s firing, Season 5 of &lt;em&gt;House of Cards&lt;/em&gt; ended with &lt;strong&gt;Robin Wright’s&lt;/strong&gt; character Claire Underwood wresting control from her husband to become president of the United States, herself. “My turn,” she says directly to the camera, in one of the most successful finale twists the show has pulled off. The flip became a moment of unexpected foreshadowing, both for the direction of the show and for the nationwide conversation on the continued struggle for gender equality. In Season 6, all eight episodes of which debuted today, Claire is the president, and Frank is just a memory&amp;#8212;much discussed, but never heard from or spoken to ever again. &lt;em&gt;House of Cards&lt;/em&gt; won’t even play his voice, which becomes increasingly obvious as Frank’s old voice memos become a sought-after testament to Claire’s awful character. In the time line, which picks up a couple of months after Claire’s ascension, Frank is dead, but we don’t know how or why.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, though&amp;#8212;even with the leg up provided by the Season 5 finale, and the delayed release&amp;#8212;the production is unable to wrap up the story. I don’t even mean that &lt;em&gt;House of Cards&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t end well, although it doesn’t; I mean, there are multiple story lines that are simply abandoned. Wright is excellent&amp;#8212;she’s doing her best work in this season, half-flirting with the audience as she scrambles to consolidate her position. In the sense that &lt;em&gt;House of Cards&lt;/em&gt; transports the viewer to a fantasy of absolute, destructive power, Wright offers a window into a female version of it&amp;#8212;one that is markedly more elegant, as it is not suffused with Spacey’s over-the-top Southern drawl.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As the show has reiterated since its debut, the power is still ugly&amp;#8212;thrilling, cathartic, and fulfilling a very human desire, yet still ugly. But Wright has inherited an impossible task. The story is trying to wrap up five seasons of action&amp;#8212;which includes the death of a half-dozen business-casual flunkies and several layers of Machiavellian manipulation. The story of Season 6 just doesn’t cohere; it barely even tracks well enough to summarize. In a way, the total breakdown is sort of beautiful; it’s like watching the story collapse in upon itself, a deserted building, carefully demolished.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In exchange for a plot arc, &lt;em&gt;House of Cards&lt;/em&gt; relies on what it has always done best: cynical provocation. The most confusing is Claire’s canny exploitation of feminist language for political gain, which in the back half of the season turns into a story about her in-office pregnancy. (It is never made clear how Claire gets pregnant; presumably, it could be her naturally conceived child with Frank, but the careful rollout of her condition suggests a much more calculated method.) Wright puts a lot into the movement of her face, but &lt;em&gt;House of Cards&lt;/em&gt; has very little to offer on Claire’s feelings about impending motherhood, or how being pregnant changes the environment of the White House. Midway through the season, Claire announces she’s returning to her maiden name, Hale. She also lectures the Situation Room, during a nuclear crisis, on how no one knows the word for the opposite of misogyny. (Claire, apparently, was &lt;a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/katienotopoulos/the-most-misandrist-things-that-ever-happened\"&gt;not paying much attention to the Internet&lt;/a&gt; in, like, 2013.)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It’s not just Claire’s story that spins out of control. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/10/diane-lane-house-of-cards-interview\"&gt;Diane Lane&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Greg Kinnear&lt;/strong&gt; play the billionaire Shepherd siblings who are trying to use Claire to their advantage, and end up becoming her primary opponents; a combination of the Koch brothers and Facebook, their corporate holdings manage to mine data, pollute the environment, steal users’ privacy, and uphold traditional family values. But even though the siblings make for a fascinating if grotesque portrait of power, privilege, and traditional family values, they barely have a story; like so much else in this season, the plot arc merely gestures toward relevance. Lane’s character Annette, a friend of Claire’s since girlhood, provides a striking foil for Claire’s ascent. (In one flashback to the dorms at Andover, the two are shown mirroring each other in elaborate cotillion-style curtsies, while sharing a bitten-off joint. It’s a loaded, arresting moment, but it’s just that: a moment.)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Shepherds amass all of the not-yet-dead pawns from the last five seasons of &lt;em&gt;House of Cards&lt;/em&gt; on their team&amp;#8212;journalists working on hit pieces, operatives-turned-data miners, Russian plants in Claire’s administration, Cabinet secretaries and Supreme Court justices that can be bought for the right price. By the end of the season, in what feels like a desperate attempt to tie up loose ends, nearly all of these characters are killed. (The list includes &lt;strong&gt;Patricia Clarkson’s&lt;/strong&gt; character Jane, &lt;strong&gt;Boris McGiver’s&lt;/strong&gt; Tom Hammerschmidt, and &lt;strong&gt;Jayne Atkinson’s&lt;/strong&gt; Cathy Durant, who technically dies twice.) The Shepherds get behind a Supreme Court ruling that would limit Claire’s power, so to outmaneuver them President Hale dives into a heated conflict between ICO, the show’s version of ISIS, and Russian President Viktor Petrov (&lt;strong&gt;Lars Mikkelsen&lt;/strong&gt;), the show’s version of &lt;strong&gt;Vladimir Putin.&lt;/strong&gt; This brings the nation to the brink of nuclear war. And if this were not enough drama, Annette begins to coolly plan the president’s assassination, with a cabal of co-conspirators that includes the vice president (&lt;strong&gt;Campbell Scott&lt;/strong&gt;). Her man for the job? Doug Stamper (&lt;strong&gt;Michael Kelly&lt;/strong&gt;), Frank Underwood’s long-serving jack-of-all-trades.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Which leads to &lt;a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/11/house-of-cards-frank-underwood-ending\"&gt;the final scene&lt;/a&gt; of the entire series. A face-off, between Claire and Doug, in the Oval Office. During which Stamper confesses to murdering Frank, somewhat by accident, by tampering with his medication&amp;#8212;and then lunges at Claire with Frank’s letter opener. Claire adroitly turns it back on him, and then, as he bleeds, suffocates him. He does not resist. So Stamper dies, in a pool of blood, inches from the presidential seal on the carpet. And Claire&amp;#8212;almost 30 weeks pregnant, with an armed nuclear football awaiting her, and political chaos looming&amp;#8212;whispers, “No more pain,” and then turns to the camera, with an almost crazed look in her eye.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It’s a great shot. The camera looks up at Claire, almost as if we are lying next to Doug on the ground. Wright’s blonde bob arcs toward the lens in a sweep. But it’s a mysterious, ambiguous ending for a show that has, until now, specialized in rather blunt storytelling. With Stamper dead, is Claire poised to succeed? Doomed to fail? Confident in her purpose? Haunted by guilt? Is this her last murder, or a harbinger of future carnage? What about everything else&amp;#8212;the press secretary who knew too much (&lt;strong&gt;Kristen Sieh&lt;/strong&gt;), the fearmongering journalist (&lt;strong&gt;Athena Karkanis&lt;/strong&gt;), the conniving Speaker of the House (&lt;strong&gt;Boris Kodjoe&lt;/strong&gt;)? What about the data mining that exposed the midterms to fraud, or the nuclear conflict in Syria? What about Claire’s as-yet unnamed daughter, and Annette’s thwarted assassination attempt? What about the story Janine (&lt;strong&gt;Constance Zimmer&lt;/strong&gt;) had worked for so long to report? The story of &lt;em&gt;House of Cards&lt;/em&gt; took &lt;em&gt;Macbeth&lt;/em&gt; and Machiavelli and unleashed it on the White House; at its end, all it can show the audience is a moment of interpersonal bloodlust.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;House of Cards&lt;/em&gt; has always been a show that works best when in conversation with its political moment; the early years were so striking because their chilly cynicism was juxtaposed against the vivid optimism of President &lt;strong&gt;Barack Obama’s&lt;/strong&gt; administration. In the Trump era, its cynicism seems like piling on to what’s already pernicious. The weekend before the real 2018 midterms, it’s jarring to watch this show, where politicians plot to steal elections and sway Supreme Court justices with horrifying gusto. In this season, the story seems to be simply about power, and the dangers of it&amp;#8212;but for a show that so rewarded Frank Underwood’s precise, brutal reign, it feels like a sharp detour.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In its way, this abrupt conclusion is a staggering commentary on what came before: the stakes of the Underwoods’ &lt;em&gt;House of Cards&lt;/em&gt; were global and political, but it could only lead to this kind of intimate, selfish violence. The rest of the story&amp;#8212;the world outside the Oval Office&amp;#8212;is abandoned midway. It’s as if &lt;em&gt;House of Cards&lt;/em&gt; is telling us the rest of the story must be written by us.&lt;/p&gt;","rubric":"lady macbeth","socialTitle":"Review: House of Cards Collapses, Finally","socialDescription":"Down a star and out of things to say, Season 6 flounders.","seoTitle":"Review: House of Cards Collapses, Finally","seoDescription":"Down a star and out of things to say, Season 6 flounders.","channel":"Hollywood","subChannel":"Television","issueDate":"","ledeCaption":"Robin Wright in the final season of &lt;em&gt;House of Cards.&lt;/em&gt;","contentSource":"web","canonicalUrl":"","contentType":"","textMimeType":"","tags":["kevin spacey","netflix","robin wright","house of cards"],"revisionAuthor":"Brad Beatson","meta":{"collectionName":"articles","modelName":"article","publishable":true,"identifiable":true,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":true,"hierarchical":false},"interactiveOverride":"","id":"5bdcb58a7d738b4e26033e43","revision":30,"createdAt":"November 2, 2018 4:37 pm","modifiedAt":"November 2, 2018 7:15 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"November 2, 2018 7:15 pm","_embedded":{"categories-channels":[{"fields":{"name":"Hollywood","slug":"hollywood","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5ae9f11fae03af0739cf33e0","revision":0,"createdAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modifiedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}},{"fields":{"name":"Television","slug":"television","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5ae9f120ae03af0739cf33e2","revision":0,"createdAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modifiedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}}],"categories-tags":[{"fields":{"name":"kevin spacey","slug":"kevin-spacey","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5b4cb7ed12afc00c253e55d3","revision":0,"createdAt":"July 16, 2018 11:21 am","modifiedAt":"July 16, 2018 11:21 am","revisionCreatedAt":"July 16, 2018 11:21 am","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}},{"fields":{"name":"netflix","slug":"netflix","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5b4cb7e1b7dc810b67cf6f4f","revision":0,"createdAt":"July 16, 2018 11:21 am","modifiedAt":"July 16, 2018 11:21 am","revisionCreatedAt":"July 16, 2018 11:21 am","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}},{"fields":{"name":"robin wright","slug":"robin-wright","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5b4cb7ed22e5400b9d092ee0","revision":0,"createdAt":"July 16, 2018 11:21 am","modifiedAt":"July 16, 2018 11:21 am","revisionCreatedAt":"July 16, 2018 11:21 am","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}},{"fields":{"name":"house of cards","slug":"house-of-cards","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5b4cb7ed6e1c450b65047cbc","revision":0,"createdAt":"July 16, 2018 11:21 am","modifiedAt":"July 16, 2018 11:21 am","revisionCreatedAt":"July 16, 2018 11:21 am","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}}],"contributorsAuthor":[{"fields":{"revisionAuthor":"Sonia Saraiya","name":"Sonia Saraiya","bio":"Sonia Saraiya is &lt;em&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#39;s television critic.

The steady drumbeat of revelations had been perplexing and damning and almost inconceivable: the video evidence of Khashoggi entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul; the reports of a 15-person Saudi “kill” team landing in the city, including a so-called bone-saw expert; and &lt;strong&gt;Donald Trump’s&lt;/strong&gt; myriad equivocations. Yet as evidence increasingly suggested a connection between M.B.S. and the presumed murder, Pompeo’s visit seemed like the latest assault to diplomacy. Despite what should have been a somber, mordant affair, he looked like Ed McMahon about to present an oversize check before the camera. (On Friday night, the Saudis conceded what everyone had long known: Khashoggi was dead.)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Back in Washington, members of the diplomatic and intelligence community that I spoke with were gobsmacked. While Axios has &lt;a href=\"https://www.axios.com/saudi-arabia-mike-pompeo-meeting-jamal-khashoggi-1480d505-dcbc-46cb-97e0-34ba5a08655f.html\"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that Pompeo uttered harsh words beneath his avuncular civility, many found the optics insurmountable. “The grip and grin sort of stunned people who saw it,” a congressional aide told me. “There is a lack of confidence that he is doing everything in his power to actually get the truth in this case.” Among diplomatic veterans, Pompeo’s affable demeanor was a real misstep. “Pompeo did not handle this well,” a former high-ranking State Department official sighed. “I don’t think it would have been difficult to be more somber in meetings and more nuanced in comments afterward.” As one State department official lamented to me, “Certainly from where I sit, it is discouraging to see the administration seemingly subordinate our values to other interests in such an egregious case.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Since reports of Khashoggi’s disappearance first began to circulate, Trump has signaled that the death of one journalist&amp;#8212;a citizen of Saudi Arabia, not the United States&amp;#8212;was not worth rupturing the U.S.-Saudi relationship. Last week, the president said it would be a “very tough pill to swallow for our country” if the kingdom was found to be responsible for the assumed killing of Khashoggi, and a $110 billion U.S. arms sales deal with Saudi Arabia was correspondingly imperiled. And despite mounting evidence that M.B.S. was involved, Trump suggested as recently as Monday that “rogue killers” could have been behind the hit. “I have never seen anything quite like that, with the president playing the role of defense lawyer to someone who appears to have murdered a U.S. resident overseas in flagrant violation of every diplomatic norm,” &lt;strong&gt;Daniel Benaim,&lt;/strong&gt; who served as a Middle East adviser to Vice President &lt;strong&gt;Joe Biden,&lt;/strong&gt; told me. “Not to even pretend to have an interest in the rule of law, and to jump straight to the part where you whitewash others’ crimes, is a gross abdication of American values.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;“The president was making excuses for the Saudis. The president, normally, would never do that,” said another former high-ranking State Department official who served in the Middle East. Instead, this source explained, a typical president would stress the seriousness of the situation, praise Khashoggi and the free press, call for an investigation&amp;#8212;possibly by the United Nations&amp;#8212;and rally U.S. allies to consolidate intelligence. By no means would he or she have expressed concerns that the arms agreement could become collateral. “There would be no indication one way or the other of what we were going to be doing,” they said.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not hyperbole to suggest that the Trump administration’s handling of the M.B.S. matter could well define the second half of the president’s term. The U.S.-Saudi relationship impacts everything, on a meta level, from oil prices to the Middle East peace puzzle. More specifically, Saudi Arabia has used its vast sovereign wealth fund, the Public Investment Fund, to intertwine itself with the American financial community&amp;#8212;Saudi money flows through Uber, JPMorgan Chase, Blackstone, Snap, and, &lt;a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2018/10/16/shiny-hollywood-partnership-with-saudi-arabia-suddenly-thrown-its-head/?utm_term=.92779c3aadda\"&gt;until recently&lt;/a&gt;, William Morris Endeavor. It’s also a bulwark against a nuclear Iran, a sort of inelegant centerpiece of Israel’s defense.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;More so than during the early crises of his presidency, Trump appears to comprehend the complexity of it all, which may be what has rendered his administration’s response so limp. Earlier this month, Trump harangued on Twitter that M.B.S. was innocent until proven guilty, a similar refrain he had used to protect &lt;strong&gt;Brett Kavanaugh’s&lt;/strong&gt; nomination. In the end, he seems to be hoping that the whole thing will blow over.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This defensiveness largely falls flat among his fellow lawmakers. “Across the Hill, there is just absolute disgust at what seems to have taken place, and bewilderment over the way the administration has reacted. And I think that runs the gamut from people whose baseline position would be deeply skeptical of the U.S.-Saudi relationship to people who have been traditionally strong supporters of the U.S.-Saudi relationship,” the congressional staffer told me. “By and large, the reaction on the Hill is outrage, and an insistence that we get ourselves a full, clear accounting and a deep skepticism that the Saudis are investigating this on their own&amp;#8212;despite Secretary Pompeo’s assurances&amp;#8212;are really going to provide clarity.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Benaim distilled the dissonance. “Other administrations would certainly have struggled with how to balance America’s values and interests, given the way a case like this impacts both,” he told me. “But Donald Trump doesn’t seem to have that struggle.” Instead, Trump says the quiet part out loud. “In a funny way, what you see is Donald Trump basically adopting the left-wing critique of the U.S.-Saudi relationship&amp;#8212;which reduces a very complex situation with a lot of different variables&amp;#8212;to basically, ‘They can get away with murder, because they are going to buy our weapons.’ He is actually taking the leftist critique of the relationship&amp;#8212;and embracing it.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the Khashoggi drama has unfolded, the close relationship between M.B.S. and &lt;strong&gt;Jared Kushner,&lt;/strong&gt; Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, has come under renewed scrutiny. (&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/18/world/middleeast/jamal-khashoggi-killing-saudi-arabia.html\"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; this week that Kushner was advocating on M.B.S.’s behalf within the White House.) Their relationship dates back to the early days of Trump’s presidency, when &lt;strong&gt;Rex Tillerson&lt;/strong&gt; was still running the State Department. As &lt;strong&gt;Dexter Filkins&lt;/strong&gt; has &lt;a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/in-the-wake-of-khashoggis-disappearance-saudi-arabias-crown-prince-is-pushed-to-the-brink\"&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker,&lt;/em&gt; Kushner identified M.B.S. as a “change agent” in the region, and developed a relationship that effectively sidelined Tillerson. According to one former administration official, Kushner’s communications with M.B.S. over the encrypted messaging service WhatsApp were a point of contention within the administration, one that was partly assuaged when Kushner began providing screenshots of his conversations with the National Security Council. But, this person added, “It was still an after-the-fact thing.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In recent days, a number of sources I have spoken with have raised the possibility that M.B.S.’s ties to Kushner may have instilled in the crown prince a belief that America would, indeed, turn a blind eye to the murder of Khashoggi. “I think there is a lot to be said [about how] M.B.S. thought he could get away with it because Jared Kushner was in his pocket, and so was the president for that matter,” the former State Department official who worked in the Middle East said. And after all, the Trump administration has largely ignored the war in Yemen; the strange sojourn of Lebanese Prime Minister &lt;strong&gt;Saad Hariri&lt;/strong&gt; to Saudi Arabia; the ill-fated boycott of Qatar; and M.B.S.’s spats with Canada and Germany. “The Trump administration made it clear that he had a blank check, and so what do you do when you have a blank check? You write in the craziest sum imaginable and take it to the bank, and that is what he did,” Benaim told me. “Only it seems that the blank check has bounced&amp;#8212;at least with Congress, if not with the president.” (The White House did not respond to a request from comment.)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Whether Trump will yield to the pressure from Capitol Hill and the international community, or side with his son-in-law and his buddy, remains an open question. But if evidence indeed shows that M.B.S. was behind the death of Khashoggi, the crown prince will join the ranks of Syrian President &lt;strong&gt;Bashar al-Assad,&lt;/strong&gt; Russian President &lt;strong&gt;Vladimir Putin,&lt;/strong&gt; and North Korean dictator &lt;strong&gt;Kim Jong Un,&lt;/strong&gt; all of whom have engaged in extraterritorial murders to send a clear message to dissidents. Meanwhile, any remaining hope that M.B.S. is the idealist he’s claimed to be has rapidly dissipated. “I think there was legitimate hope when M.B.S. came on the scene that he was going to be a reformer, and he was going to change course,” the congressional aide told me. “And despite initial appearances and words to that effect, it is pretty clear that is not the case.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;","rubric":"Foreign Policy","socialTitle":"“Absolute Disgust”: Diplomats Fume Over Pompeo’s Saudi “Grip and Grin”","socialDescription":"Throughout Washington, people

Flake&lt;/strong&gt; was dominating the national news. His elevator epiphany&amp;#8212;confronted by two victims of sexual assault, Flake suddenly called for a renewed F.B.I. background investigation of Supreme Court nominee &lt;strong&gt;Brett Kavanaugh&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#8212;made him the center of the political universe. Except, strangely enough, back in the state that the Republican senator actually represents. Arizona voters gave up on Flake a long time ago: polls show his most recent job-approval rating at a dismal 30 percent&amp;#8212;and that’s up from a truly awful 18 percent in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Which is a large part of why Flake is retiring after just one term, and why, despite his prominence on the national stage, he is a non-factor in the race to fill his senate seat. Yet even though Flake is departing, the problem that sunk him remains at the vexing center of the dead-heat campaign to replace him: how, in a politically pale-purple state, do you deal with President &lt;strong&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Flake’s approach was tortured and maddening. He made a show of criticizing Trump&amp;#8212;for sucking up to &lt;strong&gt;Vladimir Putin,&lt;/strong&gt; for the Muslim travel ban, for reactionary trade and immigration policies&amp;#8212;then voted in line with Trump’s position more than 80 percent of the time. The combination left Flake looking like an ineffectual grandstander, and it made him a prime target of Trump’s scorn. When congresswoman &lt;strong&gt;Martha McSally&lt;/strong&gt; won the Republican Senate primary, Trump mockingly tweeted that she had turned down Flake’s endorsement&amp;#8212;something Flake has denied but McSally has not bothered to clarify.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The general election race is proving a stark contrast in personalities, if not policies. McSally, 52, is a stolid, retired Air Force colonel who flew combat missions over Iraq. &lt;strong&gt;Kyrsten Sinema,&lt;/strong&gt; 42, is an openly bisexual former Green Party member who protested the Iraq War. McSally represents a Tucson district that borders Mexico; Sinema represents a mostly suburban Phoenix congressional district that includes Tempe, the state’s liberal stronghold. Sinema’s political and personal lives have gone through dramatic transformations over the years. She grew up starkly poor; at one point her family lived in an abandoned Florida gas station. Raised Mormon, she left the church before attending law school and becoming a social worker who campaigned for &lt;strong&gt;Ralph Nader&lt;/strong&gt; in the 2000 presidential election.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"embed cneembed\"&gt;&lt;div class=\"embed block cneembed\" data-url=\"//player.cnevids.com/script/video/5bbe9f3a625710412d00003b.js?muted=1\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both women, however, are trying to run to the center in their Senate campaigns, and with good reason. Democrats have narrowed the voter-registration gap with Republicans, but third parties and independents account for more than one-third of Arizona’s electorate. “It’s a play for the middle,” says &lt;strong&gt;Jeremy Duda,&lt;/strong&gt; a veteran political reporter at the &lt;em&gt;Arizona Mirror.&lt;/em&gt; “Everyone expects a heightened Democratic turnout, but they are both trying to persuade undecided moderates and independents. Sinema downplays that she’s a Democrat. Her ads say, ‘She’s independent, just like Arizona.’” The contest is most likely to be decided in the white, affluent suburbs of Phoenix and Tucson. Earlier this week, in the wake of the Kavanaugh confirmation fight, an Arizona Republican strategist met with a group of 60 such women and saw a distinct opening for the Democrats. “The average age was about 55. And man, it was palpable in the room&amp;#8212;women feeling insulted by this guy, Trump,” &lt;strong&gt;Chuck Coughlin,&lt;/strong&gt; a Republican consultant, says. “They are looking for answers on who can represent them. McSally has to get Republican women to stay with the party, and Sinema has to win over enough of them, because you can’t win a statewide office in Arizona if you’re a Democrat without getting Republican votes. Suburban women&amp;#8212;that’s where the war is.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;McSally has been trying to paint Sinema as a closet hard-core lefty and a selfish opportunist. Sinema has parried with a TV ad that included her brother wearing a “Blue Lives Matter” T-shirt, and by pledging to vote against &lt;strong&gt;Chuck Schumer&lt;/strong&gt; as majority leader should the Democrats regain the upper hand in the Senate. She has also been emphasizing McSally’s vote to repeal Obamacare as part of a wider Republican threat to Social Security and Medicare&amp;#8212;issues that play well with the state’s large population of retirees. “We see those concerns quite prominently in the polling data in Arizona,” a national Democratic Senate strategist says. “We’re cautiously optimistic.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;While Arizona has been edging slightly leftward over the years, largely because of a growing Latino population, the state has not elected a Democrat to the Senate since &lt;strong&gt;Dennis DeConcini&lt;/strong&gt; won in 1988. Early voting began Wednesday; the only debate in the race, next Monday, could prove a late turning point&amp;#8212;as could a Trump rally. Both candidates have wrestled with how to deal with the president’s fiercely loyal base. According to an early October poll by Data Orbital, Trump’s approval rating with Arizona Republicans is 78 percent. Sinema has tried to defuse the Trump factor by saying she’d vote with the president if he does something good for the state. McSally embraced Trump in order to win the Republican primary, but has kept him at arm’s length since then. “If Trump came out and they could keep him talking about the trade deal and the economy, that would be a huge win,” says Coughlin, the Republican consultant. “But I don’t think the McSally folks trust him to stay message disciplined, so they’ve been hinky about getting him out here again.” Jeff Flake can tell his would-be successors all about Trump making people jittery.&lt;/p&gt;","rubric":"Republicans","socialTitle":"The Race Is on for Jeff Flake’s Senate
