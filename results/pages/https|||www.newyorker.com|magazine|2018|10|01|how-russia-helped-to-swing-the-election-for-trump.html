unwavering on one point: that Russia played no role in putting him in the Oval Office. Trump dismisses the idea that Russian interference affected the outcome of the 2016 election, calling it a “made-up story,” “ridiculous,” and “a hoax.” He finds the subject so threatening to his legitimacy that—according to “<a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0451497899/?tag=thneyo0f-20" target="_blank" data-amzn-asin="0451497899">The Perfect Weapon</a>,” a recent book on cyber sabotage by David Sanger, of the <em class="">Times</em>—aides say he refuses even to discuss it. In public, Trump has characterized all efforts to investigate the foreign attacks on American democracy during the campaign as a “witch hunt”; in March, he insisted that “the Russians had no impact on our votes whatsoever.”</p><p>Few people, including Trump’s opponents, have publicly challenged the widespread belief that no obtainable evidence can prove that Russian interference changed any votes. Democrats, for the most part, have avoided attributing Hillary Clinton’s defeat directly to Russian machinations. They have more readily blamed <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https://www.newyorker.com/podcast/the-new-yorker-radio-hour/james-comey-makes-his-case-to-america">James Comey</a>, the former F.B.I. director, for reversing Clinton’s thin lead in the final days of the campaign by reopening a criminal investigation into her mishandling of classified e-mails. Many have also expressed frustration with Clinton’s weak performance as a candidate, and with her campaign’s tactical errors. Instead of investigating whether Russia tipped the electoral scales on its own, they’ve focussed on the possibility that Trump colluded with Russia, and that this, along with other crimes, might be exposed by the <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https://www.newyorker.com/tag/russia-investigation">probe</a> being conducted by the special counsel, Robert Mueller.</p><p>The U.S. intelligence community, for its part, is prohibited from investigating domestic political affairs. James Clapper, the former director of National Intelligence, told me, “We try not to spy on Americans. It’s not in our charter.” He emphasized that, although he and other intelligence officials produced—and shared with Trump—a postelection report confirming an extensive cyberattack by Russia, the assessment did not attempt to gauge how this foreign meddling had affected American voters. Speaking for himself, however, he told me that “it stretches credulity to think the Russians didn’t turn the election.”</p><p>Ordinarily, Congress would aggressively examine an electoral controversy of this magnitude, but the official investigations in the House and the Senate, led by Republicans, have been too stymied by partisanship to address the ultimate question of whether Trump’s victory was legitimate. Although the Senate hearings are still under way, the Intelligence Committee chairman, Richard Burr, a Republican, has already declared, “What we cannot do, however, is calculate the impact that foreign meddling and social media had on this election.”</p><p>Even the Clinton campaign has stopped short of attributing its loss to the Russians. Joel Benenson, the campaign’s pollster, told me that “a global power is fucking with our elections,” and that “every American should be outraged, whether it changed the outcome or not.” But <em class="">did</em> the meddling alter the outcome? “How will we ever know?” he said. “We probably won’t, until some Russians involved in it are actually prosecuted—or some Republican, in a moment of conscience, talks.”</p><p>Politicians may be too timid to explore the subject, but a new book from, of all places, Oxford University Press promises to be incendiary. “<a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07GJM18PL/?tag=thneyo0f-20" target="_blank" data-amzn-asin="B07GJM18PL">Cyberwar: How Russian Hackers and Trolls Helped Elect a President—What We Don’t, Can’t, and Do Know</a>,” by Kathleen Hall Jamieson, a professor of communications at the University of Pennsylvania, dares to ask—and even attempts to answer—whether Russian meddling had a decisive impact in 2016. Jamieson offers a forensic analysis of the available evidence and concludes that Russia very likely delivered Trump’s victory.</p><p>The book, which is coming out less than two months before the midterm elections, at a moment when polls suggest that some sixty per cent of voters disapprove of Trump, may well reignite the question of Trump’s electoral legitimacy. The President’s supporters will likely characterize the study as an act of partisan warfare. But in person Jamieson, who wears her gray hair in a pixie cut and favors silk scarves and matronly tweeds, looks more likely to suspend a troublemaker than to be one. She is seventy-one, and has spent forty years studying political speeches, ads, and debates. Since 1993, she has directed the Annenberg Public Policy Center, at Penn, and in 2003 she co-founded <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https://www.factcheck.org/" target="_blank">FactCheck.org</a>, a nonpartisan watchdog group. She is widely respected by political experts in both parties, though her predominantly male peers have occasionally mocked her scholarly intensity, calling her the Drill Sergeant.

Yet she expressed confidence that unbiased readers would accept her conclusion that it is not just plausible that Russia changed the outcome of the 2016 election—it is “<em class="">likely</em> that it did.”</p><p>An airtight case, she acknowledges, may never be possible. In the introduction to her new<span data-page="page_2"></span> book, she writes that any case for influence will likely be similar to that in a civil legal trial, “in which the verdict is rendered not with the certainty that e=mc<sup>2</sup> but rather based on the preponderance of evidence.” But, she points out, “we do make most of life’s decisions based on less-than-rock-solid, incontrovertible evidence.” In Philadelphia, she noted to me that “we convict people on probabilities rather than absolute certainty, and we’ve executed people based on inferences from available evidence.” She argued that “the standard of proof being demanded” by people claiming it’s impossible to know whether Russia delivered the White House to Trump is “substantially higher than the standard of proof we ordinarily use in our lives.”</p><p>Her case is based on a growing body of knowledge about the electronic warfare waged by Russian trolls and hackers—whom she terms “discourse saboteurs”—and on five decades’ worth of academic studies about what kinds of persuasion can influence voters, and under what circumstances. Democracies around the world, she told me, have begun to realize that subverting an election doesn’t require tampering with voting machines. Extensive studies of past campaigns, Jamieson said, have demonstrated that “you can affect people, who then change their decision, and <em class="">that</em> alters the outcome.” She continued, “I’m not arguing that Russians pulled the voting levers. I’m arguing that they persuaded enough people to either vote a certain way or not vote at all.”</p><p>The effect of such manipulations could be momentous in an election as close as the 2016 race, in which Clinton got nearly 2.9 million more votes than Trump, and Trump won the Electoral College only because some eighty thousand votes went his way in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. In two hundred and twenty-four pages of extremely dry prose, with four appendixes of charts and graphs and fifty-four pages of footnotes, Jamieson makes a strong case that, in 2016, “Russian masterminds” pulled off a technological and political coup. Moreover, she concludes, the American media “inadvertently helped them achieve their goals.”</p></div><div class="SectionBreak SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7"><p>When Jamieson set out to research the 2016 campaign—she has researched every Presidential election since 1976—she had no intention of lobbing a grenade. She was spending a peaceful sabbatical as a fellow at the Shorenstein Center, at Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government, exploring a rather narrow topic: the 2016 Presidential debates. She’d chosen this subject because, having devoted decades to examining the impact of advertising and other forms of persuasion on voters, she believed that most of the big questions in the field of political-campaign communications had been answered. Also, she admitted, “I have what you could call a debate fixation. Every year since 1996 I’ve done some kind of social-science look at the effects of debates.”</p><div id="cns-ads-slot-type-article-body-1" class="cns-ads-stage cns-ads-slot-type-article-body cns-ads-slot-type-article-body-1" data-name="article_body_1" data-slot-type="article_body" style="font-size: 0px; line-height: 0; overflow: hidden;"><div id="article_body_1" class="cns-ads-container" data-ad-seq="1" style="margin: 0px auto; box-sizing: content-box;"></div></div><p>This expertise helped Jamieson notice something odd about the three debates between Trump and Clinton. As she told me, “The conventional wisdom was that Hillary Clinton had done pretty well.” According to CNN polls conducted immediately after the debates, she won all three, by a margin of thirteen per cent or greater. But, during the period of the debates, Jamieson and others at the Annenberg Center had overseen three telephone surveys, each sampling about a thousand adults. In an election that turned more than most on judgments of character, Americans who saw or heard the second and third debates, in particular, were more likely than those who hadn’t to agree that Clinton “says one thing in public and something else in private.” Jamieson found this statistic curious, because, by the time of the first debate, on September 26th, Clinton’s reputation for candor had already been tarnished by her failed attempt to hide the fact that she’d developed pneumonia, and by the revelation that, at a recent fund-raising event, she’d described some Trump supporters as “deplorables”—a slur that contradicted her slogan “Stronger Together.” Other Annenberg Center polling data indicated to Jamieson that concerns about Clinton being two-faced had been “baked in” voters’ minds since before the first debate. Clinton “had already been attacked for a very long time over that,” Jamieson recalls thinking. “Why would the debates have had an additional effect?”</p><p>After insuring that the surveys had been properly conducted, Jamieson analyzed whether this change in a voter’s perception of Clinton’s forthrightness predicted a change in his or her candidate preference. To her surprise, she found that it did: as she put it to me, there was a “small but significant drop in reported <em class="">intention</em> to vote for her.” This statistic, too, struck Jamieson as curious; she knew from years of scholarship that Presidential debates, barring major gaffes, typically “increase the likelihood that you’re casting a vote for, rather than against,” a candidate.</p><div class="bxc bx-base bx-custom bx-active-step-1 bx-campaign-811003 bx-width-full bx-type-agilityzone bx-has-close-x-1 bx-has-close- bx-fx-fade" id="bx-campaign-811003" style="display: none;

Beth Myers, who helped lead Mitt Romney’s Presidential campaigns in 2008 and 2012 and worked with Jamieson on a bipartisan project about Presidential debates, told me, “If Kathleen has a point of view, I don’t know what it is. She’s extraordinarily evenhanded. She is fair and fearless.” Anita Dunn, a Democratic adviser to<span data-page="page_3"></span> Barack Obama, agrees. She, too, worked with Jamieson on the Presidential-debates project, and she studied with her as an undergraduate. Jamieson, she says, “is constantly pointing out what the data actually shows, as opposed to those of us who just assert stuff.”</p><p>Jamieson began her study of the 2016 election with an open mind. But, in the fall of 2017, as she watched the House and the Senate hold hearings on Russia’s social-media manipulations, and reviewed the sampling of dozens of Facebook ads released by the House Intelligence Committee—all paid for by Russians during the Presidential campaign—she developed suspicions about the reasons behind Trump’s victory. Before the hearings, Facebook’s chairman and C.E.O., <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/09/17/can-mark-zuckerberg-fix-facebook-before-it-breaks-democracy">Mark Zuckerberg</a>, had maintained that the amount of Russian content that had been disseminated on social media was too small to matter. But evidence presented to the Senate committee revealed that material generated by the Kremlin had reached a hundred and twenty-six million American Facebook users, leading Senator Dianne Feinstein to call the cyberattack “cataclysmic.”</p><p>House Democrats later released not only the ads but also their “targeting data”—the demographics and the geographic locations of users receiving them—which indicated to Jamieson “whom the Russians were going for.” Among other things, she could discern that the Russians had tried “to minimize the vote of African-Americans.” Bogus Kremlin-sponsored ads that had circulated online—including one depicting a black woman in front of an “<em class="small">AFRICAN-AMERICANS FOR HILLARY</em>” sign—had urged voters to tweet or text rather than vote, or to “avoid the line” and “vote from home.”</p><div id="cns-ads-slot-type-article-body-2" class="cns-ads-stage cns-ads-slot-type-article-body cns-ads-slot-type-article-body-2" data-name="article_body_2" data-slot-type="article_body" style="font-size: 0px; line-height: 0; overflow: hidden;"><div id="article_body_2" class="cns-ads-container" data-ad-seq="2" style="margin: 0px auto; box-sizing: content-box;"></div></div><p>Jamieson’s <em class="">Post</em> article was grounded in years of scholarship on political persuasion. She noted that political messages are especially effective when they are sent by trusted sources, such as members of one’s own community. Russian operatives, it turned out, disguised themselves in precisely this way. As the <em class="">Times</em> first <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/07/us/politics/russia-facebook-twitter-election.html" target="_blank">reported</a>, on June 8, 2016, a Facebook user depicting himself as Melvin Redick, a genial family man from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, posted a link to DCLeaks.com, and wrote that users should check out “the hidden truth about Hillary Clinton, George Soros and other leaders of the US.” The profile photograph of “Redick” showed him in a backward baseball cap, alongside his young daughter—but Pennsylvania records showed no evidence of Redick’s existence, and the photograph matched an image of an unsuspecting man in Brazil. U.S. intelligence experts later announced, “with high confidence,” that DCLeaks was the creation of the G.R.U., Russia’s military-intelligence agency.</p><p>Academic research has also shown that political messages tend not to change the minds of voters who have already chosen a candidate; they are most likely to persuade undecided voters. And in 2016 an uncommonly high percentage of voters liked neither candidate and stayed undecided longer than usual. By some counts, about thirty-seven million Americans—fifteen per cent of the electorate—were still undecided in the final weeks before the election.</p><p>Jamieson argues that the impact of the Russian cyberwar was likely enhanced by its consistency with messaging from Trump’s campaign, and by its strategic alignment with the campaign’s geographic and demographic objectives. Had the Kremlin tried to push voters in a new direction, its effort might have failed. But, Jamieson concluded, the Russian saboteurs nimbly amplified Trump’s divisive rhetoric on immigrants, minorities, and Muslims, among other signature topics, and targeted constituencies that he needed to reach. She noted that Russian trolls had created social-media posts clearly aimed at winning support for Trump from churchgoers and military families—key Republican voters who seemed likely to lack enthusiasm for a thrice-married nominee who had boasted of groping women, obtained multiple military deferments, mocked Gold Star parents and a former prisoner of war, and described the threat of venereal disease as his personal equivalent of the Vietcong. Russian trolls pretended to have the same religious convictions as targeted users, and often promoted Biblical memes, including one that showed Clinton as Satan, with budding horns, arm-wrestling with Jesus, alongside the message “ ‘Like’ if you want Jesus to win!” One Instagram post, portraying Clinton as uncaring about the 2012 tragedy in Benghazi, depicted a young American widow resting her head on a flag-draped coffin. Another post displayed contrasting images of a thin homeless veteran and a heavyset, swarthy man wearing an “<em class="small">UNDOCUMENTED UNAFRAID UNAPOLOGETIC</em>” T-shirt, and asked why “this veteran gets nothing” and “this illegal gets everything.” It concluded, “Like and share if you think this is a disgrace.” On Election Day, according to CNN exit polls, Trump, despite his political baggage, outperformed Clinton by twenty-six points among veterans; he also did better among evangelicals than both of the previous Republican nominees, Mitt Romney and John McCain.</p><p>In her <em class="">Post</em> article, Jamieson wrote that it was “hard to know” if Russian propaganda and dirty tricks—including the steady release of hacked e-mails, starting with Democratic National Committee correspondence that was leaked just before the Party’s convention—had made a decisive difference in 2016. Nevertheless, she argued, the “wide distribution” of the trolls’ disinformation “increases the likelihood” that it “changed the outcome.”</p><p>After the article’s publication, she returned to her sabbatical project on the debates, with a newly keen eye for Russian trolls and hackers. After reviewing the debate transcripts, scrutinizing press coverage, and eliminating other possibilities, Jamieson concluded that there was only one credible explanation for the diminishing impression among debate viewers that Clinton was forthright: just before the second debate, WikiLeaks had released a cache of e-mails, obtained by Russian hackers, that,<span data-page="page_4"></span> it said, were taken from the Gmail account of Clinton’s campaign chairman, John Podesta. They included excerpts from speeches that Clinton had given to banks, for high fees, and had refused to release during the campaign. The speeches could be used by detractors to show that, despite her liberal rhetoric, she was aligned with Wall Street. The hacked content permeated the discourse of the debates, informing both the moderators’ questions and the candidates’ answers. All this, Jamieson writes, gave legitimacy to the idea that Clinton “said one thing in public and another in private.”</p><p>During the second debate, on October 9th, before 66.5 million viewers, one of the moderators, Martha Raddatz, relayed a question submitted by a voter: Did Clinton think that it was acceptable for a politician to be “two-faced”? The question referred to a leaked passage from one of Clinton’s previously unreleased paid speeches; Russian hackers had given the passage to WikiLeaks, which posted it two days before the debate. In the speech, Clinton had cited Steven Spielberg’s film “Lincoln” as an example of how politicians sometimes need to adopt different public and private negotiating stances. The point was scarcely novel, but the debate question—which took her words out of context, omitted her reference to the movie, and didn’t mention that Russian operatives had obtained the speech illegally—made Clinton sound like a sneaky hypocrite. When Clinton cited “Lincoln” in order to defend the statement, Trump pounced.</p><div id="cns-ads-slot-type-article-body-3" class="cns-ads-stage cns-ads-slot-type-article-body cns-ads-slot-type-article-body-3" data-name="article_body_3" data-slot-type="article_body" style="font-size: 0px; line-height: 0; overflow: hidden;"><div id="article_body_3" class="cns-ads-container" data-ad-seq="3" style="margin: 0px auto; box-sizing: content-box;"></div></div><p>“She got caught in a total lie!” Trump said. “Her papers went out to all her friends at the banks—Goldman Sachs and everybody else. And she said things, WikiLeaks, that just came out. And she lied. Now she’s blaming the lie on the late, great Abraham Lincoln!”</p><p>The dynamic recurred in the third debate, on October 19th, which 71.6 million people watched. When Trump accused Clinton of favoring “open borders,” she denied it, but the moderator, Chris Wallace, challenged her by citing a snippet from a speech that she had given, in 2013, to a Brazilian bank: “My dream is a hemispheric common market with open trade and open borders.” Again, there was no mention of the fact that the speech had been stolen by a hostile foreign power; Wallace said that the quotation had come from WikiLeaks. The clear implication of Wallace’s question was that Clinton had been hiding her true beliefs, and Trump said to him, “Thank you!” His supporters in the audience laughed. Clinton said that the phrase had been taken out of context: she’d been referring not to immigrants but to an open-bordered electric grid with Latin America. She tried to draw attention to Russia’s role in hacking the speech, but Trump mocked her for accusing Putin, and joked, “That was a great pivot off the fact that she wants open borders.” He then warned the audience that, if Clinton were elected, Syrians and other immigrants would “pour into our country.”</p><p>The fact-checking organization PolitiFact later <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/12/donald-trump/trump-ive-been-proven-right-about-clinton-wanting-/" target="_blank">concluded</a> that Trump had incorrectly characterized Clinton’s speech, but the damage had been done. Jamieson’s research indicated that viewers who watched the second and third debates subsequently saw Clinton as less forthright, and Trump as <em class="">more</em> forthright. Among people who did not watch the debates, Clinton’s reputation was not damaged in this way. During the weeks that the debates took place, the moderators and the media became consumed by an anti-Clinton narrative driven by Russian hackers. In “Cyberwar,” Jamieson writes, “The stolen goods lent credibility” to “those moderator queries.”</p><p>As Jamieson reviewed the record further, she concluded that the Russian hackers had also been alarmingly successful in reframing the American political narrative in the crucial period leading up to the second debate. On Friday, October 7th, two days before it took place, three major stories landed in rapid succession. At 12:40 <em class="small">P.M.</em>, the Obama Administration released a stunning <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https://www.dhs.gov/news/2016/10/07/joint-statement-department-homeland-security-and-office-director-national" target="_blank">statement</a>, by the Department of Homeland Security and the director of National Intelligence, accusing the Russian government of interfering in the election through hacking. This seemed certain to dominate the weekend news, but at 4:03 <em class="small">P.M.</em> the Washington <em class="">Post</em> published a <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-recorded-having-extremely-lewd-conversation-about-women-in-2005/2016/10/07/3b9ce776-8cb4-11e6-bf8a-3d26847eeed4_story.html?postshare=2491475870527101&amp;tid=ss_tw" target="_blank">report</a>, by David Fahrenthold, on an “Access Hollywood” tape that captured Trump, on a hot mike, boasting about grabbing women “by the pussy.” Then, less than half an hour later, WikiLeaks released its first <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/" target="_blank">tranche of e-mails</a> that Russian hackers had stolen from Podesta’s account. The tranche contained some two thousand messages, along with excerpts from the paid speeches that Clinton had tried to conceal, including those that would be mentioned in the subsequent debates. (<a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/08/21/julian-assange-a-man-without-a-country">Julian Assange</a>, the head of WikiLeaks, has denied working with the Russian government, but he manifestly despises Clinton, and, in a leaked Twitter direct message, he said that in the 2016 election “it would be much better for GOP to win.”)</p><p>If the WikiLeaks release was a Russian-backed effort to rescue Trump’s candidacy by generating a scandal to counterbalance the “Access Hollywood” tape and the intelligence report on Russian interference, Jamieson writes, it worked splendidly. The intelligence community’s report faded from the headlines; that Sunday morning, none of its authors were invited on any major talk show. Instead, the programs breathlessly discussed the “pussy” tape and the Clinton campaign’s e-mails, which were portrayed as more or less exposing both candidates as liars. Jamieson notes, “Instead of asking how we could know that the Russians were behind the hacking, the October 9 Sunday show moderators asked what<span data-page="page_5"></span> effect the disclosures would have on the candidates’ respective campaigns and what the tape and speech segments revealed about the private versus public selves of the contenders.” If not for WikiLeaks, she writes, the media discourse in those crucial days likely would have remained locked on two topics advantageous to Clinton: Russian election subversion and Trump’s treatment of women.</p><div id="RecircCarousel" class="recircCarouselUnit RecirculationCarousel__carousel___3oV_x" style="display: none;"><p class="RecirculationCarousel__hedPre___ejDzX">MORE FROM THIS ISSUE</p><div id="cns-ads-slot-type-article-body-4" class="cns-ads-stage cns-ads-slot-type-article-body cns-ads-slot-type-article-body-4" data-name="article_body_4" data-slot-type="article_body" style="font-size: 0px;

In 2016, she believes, Russia’s involvement upset this equilibrium. She asks readers to imagine how different the 2016 election might have been if Trump’s campaign had also been hacked, disgorging the e-mails of Paul Manafort, Michael Cohen, Michael Flynn, Jared Kushner, and Donald Trump, Jr. Among other things, this would have exposed correspondence about the notorious June, 2016, Trump Tower <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/11/us/politics/trump-russia-email-clinton.html" target="_blank">meeting</a> with a Russian lawyer, and Trump’s <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-lawyer-arranged-130-000-payment-for-adult-film-stars-silence-1515787678" target="_blank">payoffs</a> to a pornographic actress and to a <em class="">Playboy</em> model. Documents that Trump has kept concealed, such as his tax returns, also might have come to light. Instead, Jamieson writes, throughout the autumn of 2016 a steady stream of content stolen from the Clinton campaign—which the press generally described as coming from WikiLeaks, rather than from Russia—“reweighted the news environment in Trump’s favor.”</p><p>As Jamieson dug further into Russia’s discourse saboteurs, she decided that she had the makings of a book. Most discussions about the 2016 election results, she believed, had been misguidedly framed around the question of whether the Russians had “changed votes directly.” There wasn’t evidence for this. Instead, she suspected, the Russians had “influenced who voted, or didn’t vote, and <em class="">that</em> could have changed the outcome.”</p><p>She set aside her debates project and continued sleuthing. She amassed more evidence this past February, when the Justice Department, in connection with the Mueller probe, released a detailed indictment of thirteen Russians working at the <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/07/magazine/the-agency.html" target="_blank">Internet Research Agency</a>, a troll farm in St. Petersburg. The operatives were described as having worked day and night waging “information warfare against the United States of America.” Then, in July, Mueller <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https://www.newyorker.com/current/guccifer-indictment-robert-mueller">indicted</a> twelve Russian intelligence officers for hacking into the computers of the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign. The indictment maintained that the Russian government had executed a sprawling and sustained cyberattack on at least three hundred people connected to the Democratic Party and the Clinton campaign, infiltrating their computers and implanting malware that, in some instances, enabled spies to covertly monitor their keystrokes. As the <em class="">Times</em> <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/13/us/politics/mueller-indictment-russian-intelligence-hacking.html" target="_blank">reported</a>, the Russians had leaked stolen files “in stages,” a tactic “that wreaked havoc on the Democratic Party throughout much of the election season.”</p><p>Strikingly, the July indictment showed that Russian hackers’ first attempt to infiltrate the computer servers in Clinton’s personal offices had taken place on July 27, 2016, the same day that Trump had declared, “Russia, if you’re listening, I hope you’re able to find the thirty thousand e-mails that are missing,” adding, “I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press.”</p><p>Another revelation from the indictment which jumped out at Jamieson was that the Russian hackers had stolen the Clinton campaign’s data analytics and voter-turnout models. A month later, when we met in Philadelphia, Jamieson said, “So we’re starting to close in on a pretty strong inference that they had everything needed to target the messaging” at “key constituencies that did effectively mobilize in this election.” Cocking an eyebrow, she added, “The possibility that this happened starts to become a probability—starts to become a <em class="">likelihood</em>—pretty quickly.”</p><div id="cns-ads-slot-type-article-body-8" class="cns-ads-stage cns-ads-slot-type-article-body cns-ads-slot-type-article-body-8" data-name="article_body_8" data-slot-type="article_body" style="font-size: 0px; line-height: 0; overflow: hidden;"><div id="article_body_8" class="cns-ads-container" data-ad-seq="8" style="margin: 0px auto; box-sizing: content-box;"></div></div></div><div class="SectionBreak SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7"><p>Joel Benenson, the Clinton pollster, was stunned when he learned, from the July indictment, that the Russians had stolen his campaign’s internal modelling. “I saw it and said, ‘Holy shit!’ ” he told me. Among the proprietary information that the Russian hackers could have obtained, he said, was campaign data showing that, late in the summer of 2016, in battleground states such as Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania, an unusually high proportion of residents whose demographic and voting profiles identified them as likely Democrats were “Hillary defectors”: people so unhappy with Clinton that they were considering voting for a third-party candidate. The Clinton campaign had a plan for winning back these voters. Benenson explained that any Clinton opponent who stole this data would surely have realized that the best way to counter the plan was to bombard those voters with negative information about Clinton. “All they need to do is keep that person where they are,” he said, which is far easier than persuading a voter to switch candidates. Many critics have accused Clinton of taking Michigan and Wisconsin for granted and spending virtually no time there. But Benenson said that, if a covert social-media campaign targeting “Hillary defectors” was indeed launched in battleground states, it might well have changed the outcome of the election.</p><p>Benenson said, “We lost Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin—three states of our Blue Wall—by about eighty thousand votes. Six hundred and sixty thousand votes were cast in those three states for third-party candidates. Winning those three states would have got us to two hundred and seventy-eight electoral votes.” In other words, if only twelve per cent of those third-party voters were persuaded by Russian propaganda—based on hacked Clinton-campaign analytics—not to vote for Clinton, then Jamieson’s theory could be valid.</p><p>Benenson said that, when he first learned about the theft, he “called another consultant on the campaign and said, ‘This is unreal.’ ” The<span data-page="page_6"></span> consultant reminded him that, in focus groups with undecided voters in the fall of 2016, “we’d hear these things like ‘I really hate Trump, but Hillary’s going to <em class="">murder</em> all these people’—all sorts of crazy stuff.” Benenson admitted that many Americans had long disliked the Clintons, and had for years spread exaggerated rumors of their alleged misdeeds and deceptions. But he wonders if some of those conspiracy-minded voters hadn’t been unknowingly influenced by Russian propagandists who were marshalling the Clinton campaign’s own analytics.</p><p>Philip Howard, the director of the Oxford Internet Institute, in England, agrees that the Russian interference could have been decisive, but he is less convinced that the stolen analytics were key. He told me, “It’s plausible, but the Russians wouldn’t have needed the Clinton campaign—they could just as easily have targeted the network of Bernie Sanders supporters.”</p><p>“Did we make mistakes?” Benenson asked, about the Clinton campaign’s performance. “Sure.” But, he said, he believes that Russian interference in the 2016 election was “the biggest threat to democracy we’ve ever had in this country, other than the wars we’ve had to fight.”</p></div><div class="SectionBreak SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7"><p>Jamieson has long been respected by the Washington media establishment, but it’s a safe bet that the Trump White House will dismiss her work as more “fake news.” A senior Trump adviser who was involved in the 2016 campaign, and has yet to see Jamieson’s book, recently sent me a text: “Where is the evidence? And when do people start to feel ashamed that they can’t accept the election results and the crappy candidate they ran?”</p><div id="cns-ads-slot-type-article-body-9" class="cns-ads-stage cns-ads-slot-type-article-body cns-ads-slot-type-article-body-9" data-name="article_body_9" data-slot-type="article_body" style="font-size: 0px; line-height: 0; overflow: hidden;"><div id="article_body_9" class="cns-ads-container" data-ad-seq="9" style="margin: 0px auto; box-sizing: content-box;"></div></div><p>Other academics may also be skeptical of “Cyberwar.” A forthcoming book on the 2016 campaign, “<a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0753RMMHC/?tag=thneyo0f-20" target="_blank" data-amzn-asin="B0753RMMHC">Identity Crisis</a>,” by the political scientists John Sides, Michael Tesler, and Lynn Vavreck, argues that Russian interference was not a major factor in the Presidential election, and that the hacked e-mails “did not clearly affect” perceptions of Clinton. Instead, they write, Trump’s exploitation of divisive race, gender, religious, and ethnicity issues accounted for his win. But the two books are not necessarily incompatible: Jamieson shows that Russian saboteurs inflamed polarizing identity issues, including resentment among whites that minority groups were benefitting at the expense of “real” Americans—which is exactly what “Identity Crisis” says swung the election.</p><p>Recently, Brendan Nyhan, a professor of public policy at the University of Michigan, <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/13/upshot/fake-news-and-bots-may-be-worrisome-but-their-political-power-is-overblown.html" target="_blank">suggested</a>, in the <em class="">Times,</em> that most fears about the impact of Russian information warfare in the 2016 campaign are exaggerated. He wrote that “a growing number of studies conclude” that “most forms of political persuasion seem to have little effect at all,” and cited studies suggesting that television ads, direct mail, and door-to-door canvassing rarely sway voters. Moreover, he argued, though the number of Russian-sponsored messages during the 2016 campaign might sound alarmingly large, the universe of information that most voters are exposed to is so vast that the impact of fake news, and other malicious online misinformation, is diluted. He noted, “Twitter, for instance, reported that Russian bots tweeted 2.1 million times before the election—certainly a worrisome number. But these represented only 1 percent of all election-related tweets and 0.5 percent of views of election-related tweets.” He concluded, “It’s hard to change people’s minds!”</p><p>Conservative news outlets like the Daily Caller have embraced the view that Russia’s social-media operations were negligible. But Jonathan Albright, of Columbia University’s Tow Center for Digital Journalism, who has been at the forefront of documenting the spread of online disinformation from Russia and other sources, describes the “drop in the bucket” argument as a case of “false framing.” He told me, “A better way to think of it is not as a drop of solution but as <em class="">pollution</em>. Every piece of messaging has some effect.” It’s misleading, he says, to focus only on the relatively small number of obvious propaganda messages, such as paid Facebook ads. Far more important, in the 2016 campaign, was “organic content”: the countless messages, created by masked Russian social-media accounts, that were spread by algorithms, bots, and unwitting American users. The reach of such content, he told me, “turned out to be huge.” Of the four hundred and seventy Facebook accounts known to have been created by Russian saboteurs during the campaign, a mere six of them generated content that was shared at least three hundred and forty million times. The Facebook page for a fake group, Blacktivist, which stoked racial tensions by posting militant slogans and stomach-churning videos of police violence against African-Americans, garnered more hits than the Facebook page for Black Lives Matter.</p><p>The Blacktivist ruse was part of a larger Russian plot to divide Americans, according to Senator Mark Warner, the vice-chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee. An expert told the committee that automated accounts typically push extremist views twenty-five to thirty times more often than authentic American social-media users do. “It blew my mind,” he told me. “It was an OMG moment. The extremes are screaming while the majority whispers.”</p><p>It is now understood that Russia’s influence was far larger than social-media companies originally acknowledged. Facebook initially claimed that Russian disinformation posted during the campaign had likely reached only ten million Facebook users; it subsequently amended the figure to a hundred and twenty-six million. Twitter recently acknowledged that it, too, was deeply infiltrated, hosting more than fifty thousand impostor accounts.</p><div class="Callout__inset-left___2rZjf" data-type="callout" data-callout="inset-left"><div class="CartoonEmbed__container___vf5AM "><a class="Link__link___3dWao CartoonEmbed__captionLink___14pNW " href="https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a21844"><figure class="Figure__figure___U_9Te  "><div class="placeholder"><div class="placeholder-buttress"></div><div class="placeholder-content"><div class="Image__image___1PhYl" role="button" tabindex="0"><div class="component-lazy pending" data-component="Lazy"></div></div></div></div><figcaption class="ImageCaption__captionWrapper___2h5XI Figure__cartoonCaptionWrapper___1tdkA ImageCaption__default___3TPB5"><span class="ImageCaption__caption___1EOQO ImageCaption__caption___1EOQO">“Sir, we’re getting ready to land—I’m going to need you to slide that under your seat.”</span></figcaption></figure></a><div class="CartoonEmbed__socialWrapper___3-ICo"><div class="SocialShare__socialShare___92Ene SocialShare__grey___dItUm CartoonEmbed__socialShare___13L3P"><a class="Link__link___3dWao SocialShare__link___Sad7k SocialShare__facebook___Jm71k " rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" data-track-type="socialShare" data-track-location="cartoon" data-source="facebook" href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fcartoon%2Fa21844&amp;display=popup&amp;ref=plugin"></a><a class="Link__link___3dWao SocialShare__link___Sad7k SocialShare__twitter___3O6QA " rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" data-track-type="socialShare" data-track-location="cartoon" data-source="twitter" href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?original_referer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fcartoon%2Fa21844&amp;text=A%20New%20Yorker%20Cartoon&amp;tw_p=tweetbutton&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fcartoon%2Fa21844"></a><a class="Link__link___3dWao SocialShare__link___Sad7k SocialShare__email___TlCif " rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" data-track-type="socialShare" data-track-location="cartoon" data-source="email" href="mailto:?subject=From%20newyorker.com:%20A%20New%20Yorker%20Cartoon&amp;body=%E2%80%9CSir%2C%20we%E2%80%99re%20getting%20ready%20to%20land%E2%80%94I%E2%80%99m%20going%20to%20need%20you%20to%20slide%20that%20under%20your%20seat.%E2%80%9D%0D%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fcartoon%2Fa21844"></a><a class="Link__link___3dWao CartoonEmbed__shop___1TDi0 " rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" data-track-type="shop" data-track-location="cartoon-shop" href="https://condenaststore.com/conde-nast-brand/cartoonbank"></a></div></div></div></div><p>James Clapper told me, “It’s hard to convey to people how massive an assault this was,”<span data-page="page_7"></span> and added, “I think the Russians have more to do with making Clinton lose than Trump did.” Yet he remains cautious about saying that this is provable. So does Albright, of the Tow Center. He has accumulated a huge quantity of data documenting Russian meddling, but he believes that it remains “difficult to quantify what the impact was on the outcome.” He told me that Russian interference “provoked outrage, created discontent with social systems such as police and safety, pushed certain urban and disadvantaged communities to feel marginalized, and amplified wedge issues beyond authentic reach through social media, which then magnified media coverage of certain issues.” He went on, “That’s an impact. But to translate that into voting patterns is very difficult.” Michael Hayden, the former director of the C.I.A. and the N.S.A., is also agnostic. He has called the Russian attacks “the most successful covert influence operation in history,” but concludes that, although Russian hackers may have, as he put it, “put their thumb on the American electoral scale,” there’s simply “no telling the impact. . . . It’s not just unknown, it’s unknowable.”</p><div id="cns-ads-slot-type-article-body-10" class="cns-ads-stage cns-ads-slot-type-article-body cns-ads-slot-type-article-body-10" data-name="article_body_10" data-slot-type="article_body" style="font-size: 0px; line-height: 0; overflow: hidden;"><div id="article_body_10" class="cns-ads-container" data-ad-seq="10" style="margin: 0px auto; box-sizing: content-box;"></div></div><p>Jamieson quotes Hayden making this argument, but writes that she must respectfully disagree.</p></div><div class="SectionBreak SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7"><p>“Cyberwar” doesn’t simply document Russia’s hacking and social-media campaigns. It also pinpoints another, less well-known, instance of Russian sabotage, and Jamieson argues that this dirty trick, in combination with the actions of trolls and hackers, may have changed the course of the 2016 campaign. In her telling, James Comey’s decision to issue a series of damaging public pronouncements on Clinton’s handling of classified e-mails can plausibly be attributed to Russian disinformation. As evidence, Jamieson cites Comey’s own story, told in interviews and in his recent memoir, of what happened behind the scenes.</p><p>Jamieson became curious as she watched Comey, on July 5, 2016, make the first of three public statements during the campaign about e-mails that Clinton had mishandled while serving as Obama’s Secretary of State. At a press conference, Comey announced his intention to recommend that the Justice Department not charge Clinton, but first he denounced her actions as “extremely careless.” Jamieson recalls wondering, “Why are you doing this?” She told me, “It was odd.”</p><p>Ordinarily, when the F.B.I. ends an investigation with no charges, it says nothing. In very high-profile cases, it sometimes issues a “declination” statement. But, even though Comey wasn’t the head of the Justice Department—he was only the F.B.I. director—he had unilaterally designated himself the spokesman for the entire investigation, and had called a live press conference without asking the permission of his boss, Attorney General Loretta Lynch.</p><p>As Jamieson worked on her manuscript, she noticed that Comey repeatedly hinted that his decision to preëmpt his boss was prompted, in part, by classified information, which, if leaked, would undermine the over-all integrity of the Clinton probe. In public, he mysteriously declined to be more specific about this intelligence, but claimed that it had compounded concerns already stirred by an impromptu private visit between Lynch and Bill Clinton, on June 27th, at an Arizona airport.</p><p>Six months after the election, the Washington <em class="">Post</em> <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/how-a-dubious-russian-document-influenced-the-fbis-handling-of-the-clinton-probe/2017/05/24/f375c07c-3a95-11e7-9e48-c4f199710b69_story.html?utm_term=.f9bb78afe3fa" target="_blank">broke a story</a> that solved the mystery. At some point in 2016, the F.B.I. had received unverified Russian intelligence describing purported e-mails from Lynch to a member of the Clinton team, in which she promised that she’d go easy on Clinton. An unnamed source told the <em class="">Post</em> that the intelligence had been viewed as “junk.” Nonetheless, Comey has reportedly told aides that he let the disinformation shape his decision to sideline Lynch. Fearing, in part, that conservatives would create a furor if the alleged e-mails became public, he began to feel that Lynch “could not credibly participate in announcing a declination.” A subsequent report, by the Justice Department’s inspector general, described Comey’s behavior as “extraordinary and insubordinate,” and found his justifications unpersuasive.</p><div id="cns-ads-slot-type-article-body-11" class="cns-ads-stage cns-ads-slot-type-article-body cns-ads-slot-type-article-body-11" data-name="article_body_11" data-slot-type="article_body" style="font-size: 0px; line-height: 0; overflow: hidden;"><div id="article_body_11" class="cns-ads-container" data-ad-seq="11" style="margin: 0px auto; box-sizing: content-box;"></div></div><p>Nick Merrill, a former Clinton-campaign spokesman, describes Comey’s actions as “mind-blowing.” He said of the intelligence impugning Lynch, “It was a Russian forgery. But Comey based major decisions in the Justice Department on Russian disinformation because of the <em class="">optics</em> of it! The Russians targeted the F.B.I., hoping they’d act on it, and then he went ahead and did so.”</p><p>In the fake Russian intelligence, one of the Clinton-campaign officials accused of conspiring with Lynch was Amanda Renteria. She was shocked to learn of the allegations, and told me that, although she is friendly with <em class="">a</em> woman named Loretta Lynch—a political figure in California—she does not know <em class="">the</em> Loretta Lynch who was the Attorney General. Renteria said, “To me, it says that, in the new world of politics, even if something isn’t real, it can still move things. You aren’t living in the world of reality anymore.”</p><p>Comey declined to comment for this article, citing the classified nature of the intelligence in question. As with the other incidents described in Jamieson’s book, it is hard to assess precisely how much of a difference his damaging statements about Clinton made at the voting booth. But it certainly didn’t help her candidacy when, just ten days before the election, Comey—reprising his self-appointed spokesperson role—announced that the F.B.I. was reopening the investigation because more Clinton e-mails had been found. Seven days later, he made a third announcement, clearing her again. Adam Schiff, the Democratic representative who is the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, told me that, if you take Comey at his word that<span data-page="page_final"></span> the fake intelligence drove his decision to publicly censor Clinton in the first place—there are skeptics who suspect that Comey’s grandstanding moralism was a bigger factor—then “it probably was the most measurable” and “the most significant way in which the Russians may have impacted the outcome of the election.”</p><p>Polls suggest the likely impact. According to the Web site <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/" target="_blank">FiveThirtyEight</a>, at midnight on October 28, 2016, the day Comey announced that he was reopening the investigation, Clinton was ahead of Trump by 5.9 per cent. A week later, her lead had shrunk to 2.9 per cent. Nate Silver, the founder of FiveThirtyEight, has noted that, during this time, coverage of the Clinton e-mail investigation dominated the news, “drowning out other headlines.” According to researchers at Microsoft, the <em class="">Times</em> ran as many front-page stories on the e-mails that week as it ran front-page stories about the candidates’ policy proposals in the final few months of the campaign. Silver concluded that all the talk about Clinton’s e-mails may have shifted the race by as much as four points, swinging Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Florida to Trump, and possibly North Carolina and Arizona, too.</p></div><div class="SectionBreak SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7"><p>Jamieson, ever the social scientist, emphasizes in her book that there is much that Americans still don’t know about the campaign, including the detailed targeting information that would clarify exactly whom the Russian disinformation was aimed at, and when it was sent. She told me, “We need to know the extent to which the Russians targeted the three key states, and which citizens’ voting patterns differed substantially from the ones you would have predicted in the past.”</p><p>Philip Howard, the Oxford professor, believes that Facebook possesses this data, down to the location of a user’s computer, and that such information could conceivably reveal whether an undecided voter was swayed after viewing certain content. He also thinks that, if there was any collusion between the St. Petersburg trolls and the Trump campaign, Facebook’s internal data could document it, by revealing coördination on political posts. But, he says, Facebook has so far resisted divulging such data to researchers, claiming that doing so would be a breach of its user agreement.</p><div id="cns-ads-slot-type-article-body-12" class="cns-ads-stage cns-ads-slot-type-article-body cns-ads-slot-type-article-body-12" data-name="article_body_12" data-slot-type="article_body" style="font-size: 0px; line-height: 0; overflow: hidden;"><div id="article_body_12" class="cns-ads-container" data-ad-seq="12" style="margin: 0px auto; box-sizing: content-box;"></div></div><p>Even if this targeting information were released, though, questions would remain. Jamieson notes that postelection interviews are often unhelpful, since few voters are able to accurately recount what influenced their decision. Scholars know even less about nonvoters. As a result, she writes in “Cyberwar,” efforts to make an “ironclad” case will be “thwarted by unknowns.” Nevertheless, her book concludes that “Russian trolls and hackers helped elect a US president.”</p><p>Jamieson told me that one of her greatest concerns is that voters were unaware of the foreign effort to manipulate them on social media. Had the public known, she believes, there likely would have been a significant backlash. “We want voters to be aware of who is trying to influence them,” she said. “That’s the reason we have disclosure requirements on our campaign ads. We’ve known, at least since Aristotle in Western culture, that the source is judged as part of the message.”</p><p>Americans eager to declare Trump’s election illegitimate will be disappointed by one of Jamieson’s arguments. Regardless of her findings about the Russian scheme, she writes that, “barring evidence of tampering” with voting machines or ballot boxes, “Trump is the duly elected President of the United States.” She says that she will leave it to others to decide whether Trump should remain in office if conclusive evidence emerges that he colluded with the Kremlin in order to win the election. “My personal judgment is yes, even then Mr. Trump would be President,” she writes. “But probably not for long.” ♦</p></div></div></div></div><footer class="ArticleFooter__footer___3-wlJ"><span class="ArticleDisclaimer__articleDisclaimer___2kCNX">This article appears in the print edition of the October 1, 2018, issue, with the headline “Russia Won.”</span><div class="ArticleContributors__bio___3XQjk"><div class="ArticleContributors__contributorWrapper___1CrIJ"><div class="Avatar__avatar___1_uRc ArticleContributors__bioAvatar___11Nu0"><a class="Link__link___3dWao  " href="/contributors/jane-mayer"><div class="Image__image___1PhYl" role="button" tabindex="0"><picture class="component-responsive-image"><source srcset="https://media.newyorker.com/photos/59097b74ebe912338a378654/1:1/w_130,c_limit/mayer-jane.png, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/59097b74ebe912338a378654/1:1/w_260,c_limit/mayer-jane.png 2x" /><img alt="" src="https://media.newyorker.com/photos/59097b74ebe912338a378654/1:1/w_130,c_limit/mayer-jane.png" title="" /></picture></div></a></div><ul class="ArticleContributors__contributorBios___3_jrJ false"><li><p class="ArticleContributors__contributorBioText___3m1QB">Jane Mayer has been a staff writer at <em>The New Yorker</em> since 1995.</p><a class="Link__link___3dWao ArticleContributors__contributorBioLink___3ifgZ " href="/contributors/jane-mayer">Read more »</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="undefined ArticleFooter__adEndArticle___2_iy_" data-cns="cns-slot-end-of-article"><div id="cns-ads-slot-type-ams-nyr-endofarticletout-0" class="cns-ads-stage cns-ads-slot-type-ams-nyr-endofarticletout cns-ads-slot-type-ams-nyr-endofarticletout-0 cns-ads-slot-state-filled cns-ads-slot-size-710x75" data-name="AMS_NYR_ENDOFARTICLETOUT_0" data-slot-type="AMS_NYR_ENDOFARTICLETOUT" style="font-size: 0px; line-height: 0; overflow: hidden;"><div id="AMS_NYR_ENDOFARTICLETOUT_0" class="cns-ads-container" data-ad-seq="0" data-google-query-id="CL2Qx-HFs94CFUWwZAodOhwAfg" style="margin: 0px auto; box-sizing: content-box; height: 75px; min-height: 75px; width: 710px; min-width: 710px;"><div id="google_ads_iframe_3379/newyorker.cm/magazine/annals-of-politics_6__container__" style="border: 0pt none; margin: auto; text-align: center; height: 75px; min-height: 75px; width: 710px; min-width: 710px;"><iframe id="google_ads_iframe_3379/newyorker.cm/magazine/annals-of-politics_6" title="3rd party ad content" name="google_ads_iframe_3379/newyorker.cm/magazine/annals-of-politics_6" width="710" height="75" scrolling="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" frameborder="0" srcdoc="" style="border: 0px; vertical-align: bottom; height: 75px; min-height: 75px; width: 710px; min-width: 710px;" data-google-container-id="b" data-load-complete="true"></iframe></div></div></div></div><div class=""><form><section class="NewsletterSubscribe__newsletterComponent___1ZI2a"><p class="NewsletterSubscribe__newsletterDek___29WDu">Never miss a big <i>New Yorker</i> story again.

Trump has adopted many contradictory positions since taking office, but he has been unwavering on one point: that Russia played no role in putting him in the Oval Office. Trump dismisses the idea that Russian interference affected the outcome of the 2016 election, calling it a “made-up story,” “ridiculous,” and “a hoax.” He finds the subject so threatening to his legitimacy that—according to “",["a",{"href":"https://www.amazon.com/Perfect-Weapon-Sabotage-Fear-Cyber/dp/0451497899/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr="},"The Perfect Weapon"],",” a recent book on cyber sabotage by David Sanger, of the ",["em","Times"],"—aides say he refuses even to discuss it. In public, Trump has characterized all efforts to investigate the foreign attacks on American democracy during the campaign as a “witch hunt”; in March, he insisted that “the Russians had no impact on our votes whatsoever.”"],["p","Few people, including Trump’s opponents, have publicly challenged the widespread belief that no obtainable evidence can prove that Russian interference changed any votes. Democrats, for the most part, have avoided attributing Hillary Clinton’s defeat directly to Russian machinations. They have more readily blamed ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/podcast/the-new-yorker-radio-hour/james-comey-makes-his-case-to-america"},"James Comey"],", the former F.B.I. director, for reversing Clinton’s thin lead in the final days of the campaign by reopening a criminal investigation into her mishandling of classified e-mails. Many have also expressed frustration with Clinton’s weak performance as a candidate, and with her campaign’s tactical errors. Instead of investigating whether Russia tipped the electoral scales on its own, they’ve focussed on the possibility that Trump colluded with Russia, and that this, along with other crimes, might be exposed by the ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/russia-investigation"},"probe"]," being conducted by the special counsel, Robert Mueller."],["p","The U.S. intelligence community, for its part, is prohibited from investigating domestic political affairs. James Clapper, the former director of National Intelligence, told me, “We try not to spy on Americans. It’s not in our charter.” He emphasized that, although he and other intelligence officials produced—and shared with Trump—a postelection report confirming an extensive cyberattack by Russia, the assessment did not attempt to gauge how this foreign meddling had affected American voters. Speaking for himself, however, he told me that “it stretches credulity to think the Russians didn’t turn the election.”"],["p","Ordinarily, Congress would aggressively examine an electoral controversy of this magnitude, but the official investigations in the House and the Senate, led by Republicans, have been too stymied by partisanship to address the ultimate question of whether Trump’s victory was legitimate. Although the Senate hearings are still under way, the Intelligence Committee chairman, Richard Burr, a Republican, has already declared, “What we cannot do, however, is calculate the impact that foreign meddling and social media had on this election.”"],["p","Even the Clinton campaign has stopped short of attributing its loss to the Russians. Joel Benenson, the campaign’s pollster, told me that “a global power is fucking with our elections,” and that “every American should be outraged, whether it changed the outcome or not.” But ",["em","did"]," the meddling alter the outcome? “How will we ever know?” he said. “We probably won’t, until some Russians involved in it are actually prosecuted—or some Republican, in a moment of conscience, talks.”"],["p","Politicians may be too timid to explore the subject, but a new book from, of all places, Oxford University Press promises to be incendiary. “",["a",{"href":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07GJM18PL/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1"},"Cyberwar: How Russian Hackers and Trolls Helped Elect a President—What We Don’t, Can’t, and Do Know"],",” by Kathleen Hall Jamieson, a professor of communications at the University of Pennsylvania, dares to ask—and even attempts to answer—whether Russian meddling had a decisive impact in 2016. Jamieson offers a forensic analysis of the available evidence and concludes that Russia very likely delivered Trump’s victory."],["p","The book, which is coming out less than two months before the midterm elections, at a moment when polls suggest that some sixty per cent of voters disapprove of Trump, may well reignite the question of Trump’s electoral legitimacy. The President’s supporters will likely characterize the study as an act of partisan warfare. But in person Jamieson, who wears her gray hair in a pixie cut and favors silk scarves and matronly tweeds, looks more likely to suspend a troublemaker than to be one. She is seventy-one, and has spent forty years studying political speeches, ads, and debates. Since 1993, she has directed the Annenberg Public Policy Center, at Penn, and in 2003 she co-founded ",["a",{"href":"https://www.factcheck.org/"},"FactCheck.org"],", a nonpartisan watchdog group. She is widely respected by political experts in both parties, though her predominantly male peers have occasionally mocked her scholarly intensity, calling her the Drill Sergeant. As Steven Livingston, a professor of political communication at George Washington University, puts it, “She is the epitome of a humorless, no-nonsense social scientist driven by the numbers. She doesn’t bullshit. She calls it straight.”"],["p","Indeed, when I met recently with Jamieson, in a book-lined conference room at the Annenberg Center, in Philadelphia, and asked her point-blank if she thought that Trump would be President without the aid of Russians, she didn’t equivocate. “No,” she said, her face unsmiling. Clearly cognizant of the gravity of her statement, she clarified, “If everything else is a constant? No, I do not.”"],["p","Jamieson said that, as an academic, she hoped that the public would challenge her arguments. Yet she expressed confidence that unbiased readers would accept her conclusion that it is not just plausible that Russia changed the outcome of the 2016 election—it is “",["em","likely"]," that it did.”"],["p","An airtight case, she acknowledges, may never be possible.

Democracies around the world, she told me, have begun to realize that subverting an election doesn’t require tampering with voting machines. Extensive studies of past campaigns, Jamieson said, have demonstrated that “you can affect people, who then change their decision, and ",["em","that"]," alters the outcome.” She continued, “I’m not arguing that Russians pulled the voting levers. I’m arguing that they persuaded enough people to either vote a certain way or not vote at all.”"],["p","The effect of such manipulations could be momentous in an election as close as the 2016 race, in which Clinton got nearly 2.9 million more votes than Trump, and Trump won the Electoral College only because some eighty thousand votes went his way in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. In two hundred and twenty-four pages of extremely dry prose, with four appendixes of charts and graphs and fifty-four pages of footnotes, Jamieson makes a strong case that, in 2016, “Russian masterminds” pulled off a technological and political coup. Moreover, she concludes, the American media “inadvertently helped them achieve their

Jamieson set out to research the 2016 campaign—she has researched every Presidential election since 1976—she had no intention of lobbing a grenade. She was spending a peaceful sabbatical as a fellow at the Shorenstein Center, at Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government, exploring a rather narrow topic: the 2016 Presidential debates. She’d chosen this subject because, having devoted decades to examining the impact of advertising and other forms of persuasion on voters, she believed that most of the big questions in the field of political-campaign communications had been answered. Also, she admitted, “I have what you could call a debate fixation. Every year since 1996 I’ve done some kind of social-science look at the effects of debates.”"],["p","This expertise helped Jamieson notice something odd about the three debates between Trump and Clinton. As she told me, “The conventional wisdom was that Hillary Clinton had done pretty well.” According to CNN polls conducted immediately after the debates, she won all three, by a margin of thirteen per cent or greater. But, during the period of the debates, Jamieson and others at the Annenberg Center had overseen three telephone surveys, each sampling about a thousand adults. In an election that turned more than most on judgments of character, Americans who saw or heard the second and third debates, in particular, were more likely than those who hadn’t to agree that Clinton “says one thing in public and something else in private.” Jamieson found this statistic curious, because, by the time of the first debate, on September 26th, Clinton’s reputation for candor had already been tarnished by her failed attempt to hide the fact that she’d developed pneumonia, and by the revelation that, at a recent fund-raising event, she’d described some Trump supporters as “deplorables”—a slur that contradicted her slogan “Stronger Together.” Other Annenberg Center polling data indicated to Jamieson that concerns about Clinton being two-faced had been “baked in” voters’ minds since before the first debate.

But, in the fall of 2017, as she watched the House and the Senate hold hearings on Russia’s social-media manipulations, and reviewed the sampling of dozens of Facebook ads released by the House Intelligence Committee—all paid for by Russians during the Presidential campaign—she developed suspicions about the reasons behind Trump’s victory. Before the hearings, Facebook’s chairman and C.E.O., ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/09/17/can-mark-zuckerberg-fix-facebook-before-it-breaks-democracy"},"Mark Zuckerberg"],", had maintained that the amount of Russian content that had been disseminated on social media was too small to matter. But evidence presented to the Senate committee revealed that material generated by the Kremlin had reached a hundred and twenty-six million American Facebook users, leading Senator Dianne Feinstein to call the cyberattack “cataclysmic.”"],["p","House Democrats later released not only the ads but also their “targeting data”—the demographics and the geographic locations of users receiving them—which indicated to Jamieson “whom the Russians were going for.” Among other things, she could discern that the Russians had tried “to minimize the vote of African-Americans.” Bogus Kremlin-sponsored ads that had circulated online—including one depicting a black woman in front of an “",["em",{"class":"small"},"AFRICAN-AMERICANS FOR HILLARY"],"” sign—had urged voters to tweet or text rather than vote, or to “avoid the line” and “vote from home.”"],["p","Jamieson’s ",["em","Post"]," article was grounded in years of scholarship on political persuasion. She noted that political messages are especially effective when they are sent by trusted sources, such as members of one’s own community. Russian operatives, it turned out, disguised themselves in precisely this way. As the ",["em","Times"]," first ",["a",{"href":"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/07/us/politics/russia-facebook-twitter-election.html"},"reported"],", on June 8, 2016, a Facebook user depicting himself as Melvin Redick, a genial family man from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, posted a link to DCLeaks.com, and wrote that users should check out “the hidden truth about Hillary Clinton, George Soros and other leaders of the US.” The profile photograph of “Redick” showed him in a backward baseball cap, alongside his young daughter—but Pennsylvania records showed no evidence of Redick’s existence, and the photograph matched an image of an unsuspecting man in Brazil. U.S. intelligence experts later announced, “with high confidence,” that DCLeaks was the creation of the G.R.U., Russia’s military-intelligence agency."],["p","Academic research has also shown that political messages tend not to change the minds of voters who have already chosen a candidate; they are most likely to persuade undecided voters. And in 2016 an uncommonly high percentage of voters liked neither candidate and stayed undecided longer than usual. By some counts, about thirty-seven million Americans—fifteen per cent of the electorate—were still undecided in the final weeks before the election."],["p","Jamieson argues that the impact of the Russian cyberwar was likely enhanced by its consistency with messaging from Trump’s campaign, and by its strategic alignment with the campaign’s geographic and demographic objectives. Had the Kremlin tried to push voters in a new direction, its effort might have failed. But, Jamieson concluded, the Russian saboteurs nimbly amplified Trump’s divisive rhetoric on immigrants, minorities, and Muslims, among other signature topics, and targeted constituencies that he needed to reach. She noted that Russian trolls had created social-media posts clearly aimed at winning support for Trump from churchgoers and military families—key Republican voters who seemed likely to lack enthusiasm for a thrice-married nominee who had boasted of groping women, obtained multiple military deferments, mocked Gold Star parents and a former prisoner of war, and described the threat of venereal disease as his personal equivalent of the Vietcong. Russian trolls pretended to have the same religious convictions as targeted users, and often promoted Biblical memes, including one that showed Clinton as Satan, with budding horns, arm-wrestling with Jesus, alongside the message “ ‘Like’ if you want Jesus to win!” One Instagram post, portraying Clinton as uncaring about the 2012 tragedy in Benghazi, depicted a young American widow resting her head on a flag-draped coffin. Another post displayed contrasting images of a thin homeless veteran and a heavyset, swarthy man wearing an “",["em",{"class":"small"},"UNDOCUMENTED UNAFRAID UNAPOLOGETIC"],"” T-shirt, and asked why “this veteran gets nothing” and “this illegal gets everything.” It concluded, “Like and share if you think this is a disgrace.” On Election Day, according to CNN exit polls, Trump, despite his political baggage, outperformed Clinton by twenty-six points among veterans; he also did better among evangelicals than both of the previous Republican nominees, Mitt Romney and John McCain."],["p","In her ",["em","Post"]," article, Jamieson wrote that it was “hard to know” if Russian propaganda and dirty tricks—including the steady release of hacked e-mails, starting with Democratic National Committee correspondence that was leaked just before the Party’s convention—had made a decisive difference in 2016. Nevertheless, she argued, the “wide distribution” of the trolls’ disinformation “increases the likelihood” that it “changed the outcome.”"],["p","After the article’s publication, she returned to her sabbatical project on the debates, with a newly keen eye for Russian trolls and hackers. After reviewing the debate transcripts, scrutinizing press coverage, and eliminating other possibilities, Jamieson concluded that there was only one credible explanation for the diminishing impression among debate viewers that Clinton was forthright: just before the second debate, WikiLeaks had released a cache of e-mails, obtained by Russian hackers, that,",["inline-embed",{"type":"analytics","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22analytics%22%2C%22url%22%3A%224%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":""}]," it said, were taken from the Gmail account of Clinton’s campaign chairman, John Podesta. They included excerpts from speeches that Clinton had given to banks, for high fees, and had refused to release during the campaign. The speeches could be used by detractors to show that, despite her liberal rhetoric, she was aligned with Wall Street. The hacked content permeated the discourse of the debates, informing both the moderators’ questions and the candidates’ answers. All this, Jamieson writes, gave legitimacy to the idea that Clinton “said one thing in public and another in private.”"],["p","During the second debate, on October 9th, before 66.5 million viewers, one of the moderators, Martha Raddatz, relayed a question submitted by a voter: Did Clinton think that it was acceptable for a politician to be “two-faced”? The question referred to a leaked passage from one of Clinton’s previously unreleased paid speeches; Russian hackers had given the passage to WikiLeaks, which posted it two days before the debate. In the speech, Clinton had cited Steven Spielberg’s film “Lincoln” as an example of how politicians sometimes need to adopt different public and private negotiating stances. The point was scarcely novel, but the debate question—which took her words out of context, omitted her reference to the movie, and didn’t mention that Russian operatives had obtained the speech illegally—made Clinton sound like a sneaky hypocrite. When Clinton cited “Lincoln” in order to defend the statement, Trump pounced."],["p","“She got caught in a total lie!” Trump said. “Her papers went out to all her friends at the banks—Goldman Sachs and everybody else. And she said things, WikiLeaks, that just came out. And she lied. Now she’s blaming the lie on the late, great Abraham Lincoln!”"],["p","The dynamic recurred in the third debate, on October 19th, which 71.6 million people watched. When Trump accused Clinton of favoring “open borders,” she denied it, but the moderator, Chris Wallace, challenged her by citing a snippet from a speech that she had given, in 2013, to a Brazilian bank: “My dream is a hemispheric common market with open trade and open borders.” Again, there was no mention of the fact that the speech had been stolen by a hostile foreign power; Wallace said that the quotation had come from WikiLeaks. The clear implication of Wallace’s question was that Clinton had been hiding her true beliefs, and Trump said to him, “Thank you!” His supporters in the audience laughed. Clinton said that the phrase had been taken out of context: she’d been referring not to immigrants but to an open-bordered electric grid with Latin America. She tried to draw attention to Russia’s role in hacking the speech, but Trump mocked her for accusing Putin, and joked, “That was a great pivot off the fact that she wants open borders.” He then warned the audience that, if Clinton were elected, Syrians and other immigrants would “pour into our country.”"],["p","The fact-checking organization PolitiFact later ",["a",{"href":"https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/12/donald-trump/trump-ive-been-proven-right-about-clinton-wanting-/"},"concluded"]," that Trump had incorrectly characterized Clinton’s speech, but the damage had been done. Jamieson’s research indicated that viewers who watched the second and third debates subsequently saw Clinton as less forthright, and Trump as ",["em","more"]," forthright. Among people who did not watch the debates, Clinton’s reputation was not damaged in this way. During the weeks that the debates took place, the moderators and the media became consumed by an anti-Clinton narrative driven by Russian hackers. In “Cyberwar,” Jamieson writes, “The stolen goods lent credibility” to “those moderator queries.”"],["p","As Jamieson reviewed the record further, she concluded that the Russian hackers had also been alarmingly successful in reframing the American political narrative in the crucial period leading up to the second debate.

The tranche contained some two thousand messages, along with excerpts from the paid speeches that Clinton had tried to conceal, including those that would be mentioned in the subsequent debates.

The intelligence community’s report faded from the headlines; that Sunday morning, none of its authors were invited on any major talk show. Instead, the programs breathlessly discussed the “pussy” tape and the Clinton campaign’s e-mails, which were portrayed as more or less exposing both candidates as liars. Jamieson notes, “Instead of asking how we could know that the Russians were behind the hacking, the October 9 Sunday show moderators asked what",["inline-embed",{"type":"analytics","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22analytics%22%2C%22url%22%3A%225%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":""}]," effect the disclosures would have on the candidates’ respective campaigns and what the tape and speech segments revealed about the private versus public selves of the contenders.” If not for WikiLeaks, she writes, the media discourse in those crucial days likely would have remained locked on two topics advantageous to Clinton: Russian election subversion and Trump’s treatment of women."],["p","Jamieson also argues that, in most hotly contested elections, the candidates blunt each other’s messages, which results in fairly balanced media coverage. In 2016, she believes, Russia’s involvement upset this equilibrium. She asks readers to imagine how different the 2016 election might have been if Trump’s campaign had also been hacked, disgorging the e-mails of Paul Manafort, Michael Cohen, Michael Flynn, Jared Kushner, and Donald Trump, Jr. Among other things, this would have exposed correspondence about the notorious June, 2016, Trump Tower ",["a",{"href":"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/11/us/politics/trump-russia-email-clinton.html"},"meeting"]," with a Russian lawyer, and Trump’s ",["a",{"href":"https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-lawyer-arranged-130-000-payment-for-adult-film-stars-silence-1515787678"},"payoffs"]," to a pornographic actress and to a ",["em","Playboy"]," model. Documents that Trump has kept concealed, such as his tax returns, also might have come to light. Instead, Jamieson writes, throughout the autumn of 2016 a steady stream of content stolen from the Clinton campaign—which the press generally described as coming from WikiLeaks, rather than from Russia—“reweighted the news environment in Trump’s favor.”"],["p","As Jamieson dug further into Russia’s discourse saboteurs, she decided that she had the makings of a book. Most discussions about the 2016 election results, she believed, had been misguidedly framed around the question of whether the Russians had “changed votes directly.” There wasn’t evidence for this. Instead, she suspected, the Russians had “influenced who voted, or didn’t vote, and ",["em","that"]," could have changed the outcome.”"],["p","She set aside her debates project and continued sleuthing. She amassed more evidence this past February, when the Justice Department, in connection with the Mueller probe, released a detailed indictment of thirteen Russians working at the ",["a",{"href":"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/07/magazine/the-agency.html"},"Internet Research Agency"],", a troll farm in St. Petersburg. The operatives were described as having worked day and night waging “information warfare against the United States of America.” Then, in July, Mueller ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/current/guccifer-indictment-robert-mueller"},"indicted"]," twelve Russian intelligence officers for hacking into the computers of the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign. The indictment maintained that the Russian government had executed a sprawling and sustained cyberattack on at least three hundred people connected to the Democratic Party and the Clinton campaign, infiltrating their computers and implanting malware that, in some instances, enabled spies to covertly monitor their keystrokes. As the ",["em","Times"]," ",["a",{"href":"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/13/us/politics/mueller-indictment-russian-intelligence-hacking.html"},"reported"],", the Russians had leaked stolen files “in stages,” a tactic “that wreaked havoc on the Democratic Party throughout much of the election season.”"],["p","Strikingly, the July indictment showed that Russian hackers’ first attempt to infiltrate the computer servers in Clinton’s personal offices had taken place on July 27, 2016, the same day that Trump had declared, “Russia, if you’re listening, I hope you’re able to find the thirty thousand e-mails that are missing,” adding, “I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press.”"],["p","Another revelation from the indictment which jumped out at Jamieson was that the Russian hackers had stolen the Clinton campaign’s data analytics and voter-turnout models.

Benenson, the Clinton pollster, was stunned when he learned, from the July indictment, that the Russians had stolen his campaign’s internal modelling. “I saw it and said, ‘Holy shit!’ ” he told me. Among the proprietary information that the Russian hackers could have obtained, he said, was campaign data showing that, late in the summer of 2016, in battleground states such as Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania, an unusually high proportion of residents whose demographic and voting profiles identified them as likely Democrats were “Hillary defectors”: people so unhappy with Clinton that they were considering voting for a third-party candidate. The Clinton campaign had a plan for winning back these voters. Benenson explained that any Clinton opponent who stole this data would surely have realized that the best way to counter the plan was to bombard those voters with negative information about Clinton. “All they need to do is keep that person where they are,” he said, which is far easier than persuading a voter to switch candidates. Many critics have accused Clinton of taking Michigan and Wisconsin for granted and spending virtually no time there. But Benenson said that, if a covert social-media campaign targeting “Hillary defectors” was indeed launched in battleground states, it might well have changed the outcome of the election."],["p","Benenson said, “We lost Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin—three states of our Blue Wall—by about eighty thousand votes. Six hundred and sixty thousand votes were cast in those three states for third-party candidates. Winning those three states would have got us to two hundred and seventy-eight electoral votes.” In other words, if only twelve per cent of those third-party voters were persuaded by Russian propaganda—based on hacked Clinton-campaign analytics—not to vote for Clinton, then Jamieson’s theory could be valid."],["p","Benenson said that, when he first learned about the theft, he “called another consultant on the campaign and said, ‘This is unreal.’ ” The",["inline-embed",{"type":"analytics","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22analytics%22%2C%22url%22%3A%226%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":""}]," consultant reminded him that, in focus groups with undecided voters in the fall of 2016, “we’d hear these things like ‘I really hate Trump, but Hillary’s going to ",["em","murder"]," all these people’—all sorts of crazy stuff.” Benenson admitted that many Americans had long disliked the Clintons, and had for years spread exaggerated rumors of their alleged misdeeds and deceptions. But he wonders if some of those conspiracy-minded voters hadn’t been unknowingly influenced by Russian propagandists who were marshalling the Clinton campaign’s own analytics."],["p","Philip Howard, the director of the Oxford Internet Institute, in England, agrees that the Russian interference could have been decisive, but he is less convinced that the stolen analytics were key. He told me, “It’s plausible, but the Russians wouldn’t have needed the Clinton campaign—they could just as easily have targeted the network of Bernie Sanders supporters.”"],["p","“Did we make mistakes?” Benenson asked, about the Clinton campaign’s performance. “Sure.” But, he said, he believes that Russian interference in the 2016 election was “the biggest threat to democracy we’ve ever

has long been respected by the Washington media establishment, but it’s a safe bet that the Trump White House will dismiss her work as more “fake news.” A senior Trump adviser who was involved in the 2016 campaign, and has yet to see Jamieson’s book, recently sent me a text: “Where is the evidence? And when do people start to feel ashamed that they can’t accept the election results and the crappy candidate they ran?”"],["p","Other academics may also be skeptical of “Cyberwar.” A forthcoming book on the 2016 campaign, “",["a",{"href":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0753RMMHC/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1"},"Identity Crisis"],",” by the political scientists John Sides, Michael Tesler, and Lynn Vavreck, argues that Russian interference was not a major factor in the Presidential election, and that the hacked e-mails “did not clearly affect” perceptions of Clinton. Instead, they write, Trump’s exploitation of divisive race, gender, religious, and ethnicity issues accounted for his win. But the two books are not necessarily incompatible: Jamieson shows that Russian saboteurs inflamed polarizing identity issues, including resentment among whites that minority groups were benefitting at the expense of “real” Americans—which is exactly what “Identity Crisis” says swung the election."],["p","Recently, Brendan Nyhan, a professor of public policy at the University of Michigan, ",["a",{"href":"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/13/upshot/fake-news-and-bots-may-be-worrisome-but-their-political-power-is-overblown.html"},"suggested"],", in the ",["em","Times,"]," that most fears about the impact of Russian information warfare in the 2016 campaign are exaggerated. He wrote that “a growing number of studies conclude” that “most forms of political persuasion seem to have little effect at all,” and cited studies suggesting that television ads, direct mail, and door-to-door canvassing rarely sway voters. Moreover, he argued, though the number of Russian-sponsored messages during the 2016 campaign might sound alarmingly large, the universe of information that most voters are exposed to is so vast that the impact of fake news, and other malicious online misinformation, is diluted. He noted, “Twitter, for instance, reported that Russian bots tweeted 2.1 million times before the election—certainly a worrisome number. But these represented only 1 percent of all election-related tweets and 0.5 percent of views of election-related tweets.” He concluded, “It’s hard to change people’s minds!”"],["p","Conservative news outlets like the Daily Caller have embraced the view that Russia’s social-media operations were negligible. But Jonathan Albright, of Columbia University’s Tow Center for Digital Journalism, who has been at the forefront of documenting the spread of online disinformation from Russia and other sources, describes the “drop in the bucket” argument as a case of “false framing.” He told me, “A better way to think of it is not as a drop of solution but as ",["em","pollution"],". Every piece of messaging has some effect.” It’s misleading, he says, to focus only on the relatively small number of obvious propaganda messages, such as paid Facebook ads. Far more important, in the 2016 campaign, was “organic content”: the countless messages, created by masked Russian social-media accounts, that were spread by algorithms, bots, and unwitting American users. The reach of such content, he told me, “turned out to be huge.” Of the four hundred and seventy Facebook accounts known to have been created by Russian saboteurs during the campaign, a mere six of them generated content that was shared at least three hundred and forty million times. The Facebook page for a fake group, Blacktivist, which stoked racial tensions by posting militant slogans and stomach-churning videos of police violence against African-Americans, garnered more hits than the Facebook page for Black Lives Matter."],["p","The Blacktivist ruse was part of a larger Russian plot to divide Americans, according to Senator Mark Warner, the vice-chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee. An expert told the committee that automated accounts typically push extremist views twenty-five to thirty times more often than authentic American social-media users do. “It blew my mind,” he told me. “It was an OMG moment. The extremes are screaming while the majority whispers.”"],["p","It is now understood that Russia’s influence was far larger than social-media companies originally acknowledged. Facebook initially claimed that Russian disinformation posted during the campaign had likely reached only ten million Facebook users; it subsequently amended the figure to a hundred and twenty-six million.

In her telling, James Comey’s decision to issue a series of damaging public pronouncements on Clinton’s handling of classified e-mails can plausibly be attributed to Russian disinformation.

An unnamed source told the ",["em","Post"]," that the intelligence had been viewed as “junk.” Nonetheless, Comey has reportedly told aides that he let the disinformation shape his decision to sideline Lynch. Fearing, in part, that conservatives would create a furor if the alleged e-mails became public, he began to feel that Lynch “could not credibly participate in announcing a declination.” A subsequent report, by the Justice Department’s inspector general, described Comey’s behavior as “extraordinary and insubordinate,” and found his justifications unpersuasive."],["p","Nick Merrill, a former Clinton-campaign spokesman, describes Comey’s actions as “mind-blowing.” He said of the intelligence impugning Lynch, “It was a Russian forgery.

Silver concluded that all the talk about Clinton’s e-mails may have shifted the race by as much as four points, swinging Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Florida to Trump, and possibly North Carolina and Arizona, too."]],["inline-embed",{"type":"section","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22section%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cp%3EJamieson%2C%20ever%20the%20social%20scientist%2C%20emphasizes%20in%20her%20book%20that%20there%20is%20much%20that%20Americans%20still%20don%E2%80%99t%20know%20about%20the%20campaign%2C%20including%20the%20detailed%20targeting%20information%20that%20would%20clarify%20exactly%20whom%20the%20Russian%20disinformation%20was%20aimed%20at%2C%20and%20when%20it%20was%20sent.%20She%20told%20me%2C%20%E2%80%9CWe%20need%20to%20know%20the%20extent%20to%20which%20the%20Russians%20targeted%20the%20three%20key%20states%2C%20and%20which%20citizens%E2%80%99%20voting%20patterns%20differed%20substantially%20from%20the%20ones%20you%20would%20have%20predicted%20in%20the%20past.%E2%80%9D%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EPhilip%20Howard%2C%20the%20Oxford%20professor%2C%20believes%20that%20Facebook%20possesses%20this%20data%2C%20down%20to%20the%20location%20of%20a%20user%E2%80%99s%20computer%2C%20and%20that%20such%20information%20could%20conceivably%20reveal%20whether%20an%20undecided%20voter%20was%20swayed%20after%20viewing%20certain%20content.%20He%20also%20thinks%20that%2C%20if%20there%20was%20any%20collusion%20between%20the%20St.%20Petersburg%20trolls%20and%20the%20Trump%20campaign%2C%20Facebook%E2%80%99s%20internal%20data%20could%20document%20it%2C%20by%20revealing%20co%C3%B6rdination%20on%20political%20posts.%20But%2C%20he%20says%2C%20Facebook%20has%20so%20far%20resisted%20divulging%20such%20data%20to%20researchers%2C%20claiming%20that%20doing%20so%20would%20be%20a%20breach%20of%20its%20user%20agreement.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EEven%20if%20this%20targeting%20information%20were%20released%2C%20though%2C%20questions%20would%20remain.%20Jamieson%20notes%20that%20postelection%20interviews%20are%20often%20unhelpful%2C%20since%20few%20voters%20are%20able%20to%20accurately%20recount%20what%20influenced%20their%20decision.%20Scholars%20know%20even%20less%20about%20nonvoters.%20As%20a%20result%2C%20she%20writes%20in%20%E2%80%9CCyberwar%2C%E2%80%9D%20efforts%20to%20make%20an%20%E2%80%9Cironclad%E2%80%9D%20case%20will%20be%20%E2%80%9Cthwarted%20by%20unknowns.%E2%80%9D%20Nevertheless%2C%20her%20book%20concludes%20that%20%E2%80%9CRussian%20trolls%20and%20hackers%20helped%20elect%20a%20US%20president.%E2%80%9D%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EJamieson%20told%20me%20that%20one%20of%20her%20greatest%20concerns%20is%20that%20voters%20were%20unaware%20of%20the%20foreign%20effort%20to%20manipulate%20them%20on%20social%20media.%20Had%20the%20public%20known%2C%20she%20believes%2C%20there%20likely%20would%20have%20been%20a%20significant%20backlash.%20%E2%80%9CWe%20want%20voters%20to%20be%20aware%20of%20who%20is%20trying%20to%20influence%20them%2C%E2%80%9D%20she%20said.%20%E2%80%9CThat%E2%80%99s%20the%20reason%20we%20have%20disclosure%20requirements%20on%20our%20campaign%20ads.%20We%E2%80%99ve%20known%2C%20at%20least%20since%20Aristotle%20in%20Western%20culture%2C%20that%20the%20source%20is%20judged%20as%20part%20of%20the%20message.%E2%80%9D%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EAmericans%20eager%20to%20declare%20Trump%E2%80%99s%20election%20illegitimate%20will%20be%20disappointed%20by%20one%20of%20Jamieson%E2%80%99s%20arguments.%20Regardless%20of%20her%20findings%20about%20the%20Russian%20scheme%2C%20she%20writes%20that%2C%20%E2%80%9Cbarring%20evidence%20of%20tampering%E2%80%9D%20with%20voting%20machines%20or%20ballot%20boxes%2C%20%E2%80%9CTrump%20is%20the%20duly%20elected%20President%20of%20the%20United%20States.%E2%80%9D%20She%20says%20that%20she%20will%20leave%20it%20to%20others%20to%20decide%20whether%20Trump%20should%20remain%20in%20office%20if%20conclusive%20evidence%20emerges%20that%20he%20colluded%20with%20the%20Kremlin%20in%20order%20to%20win%20the%20election.%20%E2%80%9CMy%20personal%20judgment%20is%20yes%2C%20even%20then%20Mr.%20Trump%20would%20be%20President%2C%E2%80%9D%20she%20writes.%20%E2%80%9CBut%20probably%20not%20for%20long.%E2%80%9D%C2%A0%E2%99%A6%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%22%7D","ref":""},["p","Jamieson, ever the social scientist, emphasizes in her book that there is much that Americans still don’t know about the campaign, including the detailed targeting information that would clarify exactly whom the Russian disinformation was aimed at, and when it was sent. She told me, “We need to know the extent to which the Russians targeted the three key states, and which citizens’ voting patterns differed substantially from the ones you would have predicted in the past.”"],["p","Philip Howard, the Oxford professor, believes that Facebook possesses this data, down to the location of a user’s computer, and that such information could conceivably reveal whether an undecided voter was swayed after viewing certain content. He also thinks that, if there was any collusion between the St. Petersburg trolls and the Trump campaign, Facebook’s internal data could document it, by revealing coördination on political posts. But, he says, Facebook has so far resisted divulging such data to researchers, claiming that doing so would be a breach of its user agreement."],["p","Even if this targeting information were released, though, questions would remain. Jamieson notes that postelection interviews are often unhelpful, since few voters are able to accurately recount what influenced their decision. Scholars know even less about nonvoters. As a result, she writes in “Cyberwar,” efforts to make an “ironclad” case will be “thwarted by unknowns.” Nevertheless, her book concludes that “Russian trolls and hackers helped elect a US president.”"],["p","Jamieson told me that one of her greatest concerns is that voters were unaware of the foreign effort to manipulate them on social media. Had the public known, she believes, there likely would have been a significant backlash. “We want voters to be aware of who is trying to influence them,” she said. “That’s the reason we have disclosure requirements on our campaign ads. We’ve known, at least since Aristotle in Western culture, that the source is judged as part of the message.”"],["p","Americans eager to declare Trump’s election illegitimate will be disappointed by one of Jamieson’s arguments. Regardless of her findings about the Russian scheme, she writes that, “barring evidence of tampering” with voting machines or ballot boxes, “Trump is the duly elected President of the United States.” She says that she will leave it to others to decide whether Trump should remain in office if conclusive evidence emerges that he colluded with the Kremlin in order to win the election. “My personal judgment is yes, even then Mr. Trump would be President,” she writes. “But probably not for long.” ♦"]]],"canonicalUrl":"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/10/01/how-russia-helped-to-swing-the-election-for-trump","categories":{"sections-toc":[{"id":"590412649f91e567e06eca93","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"590412649f91e567e06eca93","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Reporting","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"reporting"},{"id":"5902abaf27562e4d156e37e1","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections -

Murrell, a four-year-old boy with dreadlocks to his chin, moved with his family to Atlanta in the fall of 2015. On his first day at his new preschool, he cried the whole morning. He wouldn’t sit still in his chair. He’d pop up and snatch the glasses off a classmate’s face, or spit at the teacher. When he was tired, he waved his arms in the air, begging his teacher to hold him. On the rare occasions that his teacher complimented him, he shouted “Yay!” too loudly."],["p","His mother, Latoya Martin, a hair stylist, had moved with her husband and three children from Donalsonville, a rural town in Seminole County, in the southwest corner of Georgia, to be closer to psychiatrists and neurologists who would understand why her son was developmentally delayed. He couldn’t string words together into a sentence. His teachers called Latoya nearly every day and told her to pick him up early, because he was disrupting the class. When Latoya resisted—she was busy looking for a new job—her friends warned her that the school might call child-protective services if she couldn’t pick up Seth promptly. Latoya sensed that the teachers were accusing her of being a bad parent, so she informed the school’s principal that she had never done drugs and that in high school her G.P.A. had been 4.0. Latoya’s sister Anita said, “They kept saying we needed to work with him more at home. I’m, like, we work with him—that’s not the problem. This is part of his disability!”"],["p","After a month, Latoya was told that Seth would be sent to a school twenty minutes away, in the Georgia Network for Educational and Therapeutic Support, a constellation of schools, known as ",["em",{"class":"small"},"GNETS"],", attended by four thousand students with emotional and behavioral disabilities. Anita, a public-school teacher in Atlanta for nearly two decades, said, “I was just trying to figure it out in my head—we already have special-ed classes in the schools, so why is there this second system?” ",["em",{"class":"small"},"GNETS"]," has a ten-per-cent graduation rate, compared with seventy-eight per cent for other public schools in Georgia."],["p","Seth, who at twenty-one months had been given a diagnosis of pervasive developmental disorder—a loosely defined diagnosis often given to toddlers when their condition is not understood—was assigned to the Ash Street Center, one of a hundred and seventy-nine sites in the ",["em",{"class":"small"},"GNETS"]," network. The school is surrounded by a gated fence. Latoya said that the next-youngest student in Seth’s class was nine. The year before, a teaching assistant at Ash Street had been arrested after knocking a fourteen-year-old boy to the floor, choking him, and shouting, “I will kill that little motherfucker!”"],["p","Latoya said that, when she walked into her son’s class, “I did not see one white child. All I saw was black boys.” Seth’s “target behavior,” according to the center’s intervention plan, was to “comply with adult directives.” Latoya demanded that Seth be returned to his neighborhood school, but she was told that first he had to meet his performance goals, which included following instructions seventy per cent of the day. “You all know this is against the law, right?” she said to Seth’s teacher. The federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, passed in 1975, states that children with disabilities must be educated with their nondisabled peers to the “maximum appropriate extent.” They can be removed from their classrooms only if their disabilities are so severe that they can’t learn in a less restrictive setting."],["p","After Seth had gone to Ash Street for ten days, Latoya and her husband, Tercel, who was working at a Toys R Us, returned with their children to Donalsonville, where Latoya’s family has lived for as many generations as they can trace back. Latoya’s sister Yvette, a high-school teacher, said, “She was just praying that a small town with teachers who had grown up around them would know how to take care of her baby.” Latoya tried to enroll all three children in their former school, where she and her twelve siblings had gone. Though black and white students at the school had held separate proms as recently as the nineteen-eighties, Latoya trusted the teachers, many of whom she’d grown up with. Her two older children rejoined their classes, but the school district said that Seth was now classified as a ",["em",{"class":"small"},"GNETS"]," student. He would have to take a bus to a ",["em",{"class":"small"},"GNETS"]," school called Pathways, in Bainbridge, thirty minutes away."],["inline-embed",{"type":"callout","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22callout%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22feature-small%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22image%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522image%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%2522%252Fphotos%252F5ba416bb35ba3a2f41406aed%2522%252C%2522width%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522height%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522caption%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%225ba416bb35ba3a2f41406aed%5C%22%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%22%2C%22attrs%22%3A%7B%7D%7D","ref":""},["inline-embed",{"type":"image","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22image%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22%2Fphotos%2F5ba416bb35ba3a2f41406aed%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":"5ba416bb35ba3a2f41406aed"}]],["p","Latoya’s sister Sonja, who lived in Bainbridge, occasionally stopped by Pathways in the middle of the day. She described the school as a kind of ghost town. The front office was empty—the secretary and the coördinator had left, and the positions were never filled—and there was no full-time nurse, social worker, resource officer, or behavioral specialist. (The district’s superintendent said that off-site staff provided support to the school.) Sonja said, of the first time she came to the school, “I walked down the hallway hollering, ‘Hello? Hello? Anybody here?’ ” She looked in Seth’s classroom and saw him sleeping on the floor, alone. His teacher was in another room."],["p","There are roughly a hundred students at Pathways, which has three sites in the region, and all of the students are classified by the state as “economically disadvantaged.” In Bainbridge, there was only one other student in the elementary-school class: MaKenzie Phillips, a petite thirteen-year-old white girl who immediately warmed to Seth, calling him her baby. MaKenzie took antidepressants, antipsychotics, two drugs for attention-deficit disorder, and anti-anxiety pills. She was generally calm and said, “Yes, Ma’am,” when addressed, though she also interrupted conversations with vulgar words. She was in the elementary class because she had an I.Q. of 40. She spent much of the day flipping through magazines that she couldn’t read. MaKenzie’s mother, Erica, said that, whenever she dropped by the classroom, “there was no instruction. But I just figured I was coming at the wrong time of day.”"],["p","Seth’s class was led by Melissa Williams-Brown, who lived a few blocks from Latoya and had gone to her high school. She was not certified to teach elementary school, and had little knowledge of the nature of her students’ disabilities. “I didn’t get any specialized training,” she told me. “I just winged it.” The students at Pathways had bipolar disorder, ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/03/28/the-genetics-of-schizophrenia"},"schizophrenia"],", A.D.H.D., ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/01/25/seeing-the-spectrum"},"autism"],", or, as one teacher put it, “home-life issues” such as neglect, trauma, or poverty. Williams-Brown didn’t understand why Seth, who was eventually given a diagnosis of autism, couldn’t return to his neighborhood school, where there were more qualified teachers. “There was nothing in place for this young man,” she told me. “I just felt like these students, especially the black boys, were put there, basically, because they intimidated their

According to a report by researchers at the University of Georgia, the schools, then called psychoeducational centers, would rely on teachers trained in developmental psychology, ready to “face the assault of bizarre behavior.” They were taught that they might be the “only agent for change in the life of a disturbed child.” Mary Wood, a professor emerita at the University of Georgia, who developed the concept, said that she intended for each program to have a consulting psychiatrist, a social worker, a program evaluator, and a psychologist. But as the first generation of directors retired, in the nineties, “the pieces of the mosaic dropped out,” she said."],["p","In the two-thousands, funding was cut, and the psychologists who remained seemed to be given free rein. One mother learned that a school psychologist was planning to subject her daughter, who had post-traumatic stress disorder, to fifteen hours of “experiments” devised to provoke misbehavior. “If I go to a mechanic with my car and my car is not doing the problem that I brought it there for, the mechanic can’t diagnose it,” the psychologist explained, at an administrative trial in 2005. “That’s the same situation here.” Over the years, a few parents became so suspicious of the program that they sent their children to school wearing recording devices. On one tape, ",["a",{"href":"https://www.ajc.com/news/local/expensive-fight-over-boy-with-autism/kjVHo7T1kmtigsN1qrJr4N/"},"as the Atlanta ",["em","Journal-Constitution"]," reported"],", a teacher could be heard giving a child what someone in the room called a “be-quiet hit.” On another, teachers laughed about how they had put a student in a seclusion room because they needed a break. In 2004, a thirteen-year-old student hanged himself in a Time Out Room, an eight-by-eight concrete cell that could be locked from the outside."],["p","Leslie Lipson, a lawyer at the Georgia Advocacy Office, a state-funded agency that represents people with disabilities, said that she first learned of the ",["em",{"class":"small"},"GNETS"]," system in 2001, when a mother called to report that her son was put in a seclusion room nearly every day. “It’s all little black boys at this school,” the mother told her. Lipson researched the mother’s claims and then rushed into her boss’s office to tell him that she’d discovered an “insidious, shadow education system.” She said, “I thought I was Erin Brockovich. I was, like, ‘You are not going to believe this! There is an entire segregated system in Georgia! Can we shut this down immediately?’ I was talking a thousand miles a minute, and my boss waited for me to take a breath. He was, like, ‘Um, yeah, these schools have been around since before you were born.’ ”"],["p","Lipson studied the history of the schools, some of which were established in buildings that had housed schools for black children during the Jim Crow era. At a time when there was an outcry against court-ordered integration, ",["em",{"class":"small"},"GNETS"]," became a mechanism for resegregating schools. “It became a way to filter out black boys, who at younger and younger ages are perceived to have behavioral disabilities,” she said."],["p","The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (",["em",{"class":"small"},"IDEA"],") requires that students with disabilities learn in the “least restrictive environment,” a loose term that may mean different things depending on the race or the class of the student. Nirmala Erevelles, a professor of disability studies at the University of Alabama, told me that, “in general, when it comes to people of color—particularly poor people of color—we choose the most restrictive possibility,” sending students to “the most segregated and punitive spaces in the public-school system.” According to Beth Ferri, a disability scholar at Syracuse University, ",["em",{"class":"small"},"IDEA"]," provided a kind of loophole to the 1954 Supreme Court decision in ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2001/02/12/civil-actions"},"Brown v. Board of Education"],", which outlawed racial segregation in schools. Now racial segregation continued “under the guise of ‘disability,’ ” she said. “You don’t need to talk about any race anymore. You can just say that the kid is a slow learner, or defiant, or disrespectful.” Ferri said that ",["em",{"class":"small"},"IDEA"]," “treated disability as apolitical—a biological fact. It didn’t think about things like racial or cultural bias.”"],["p","Data obtained through records requests reveal that the percentage of students in the ",["em",{"class":"small"},"GNETS"]," program who are black boys is double that of the public schools in the state. Most of the students in ",["em",{"class":"small"},"GNETS"]," are classified as having an “emotional and behavioral disorder,” a vague label that does not correspond to any particular medical diagnosis. A teacher who worked for five years at a ",["em",{"class":"small"},"GNETS"]," program called Coastal Academy, in Brunswick, told me, “We always had a sprinkling of middle-class white kids, maybe two or three, but they didn’t stay long. Everyone made sure they got out. It was the black students who were trapped there. They came in first grade and never left.” Coastal Academy occupies a lot that once held an all-black school, originally called the Freedman’s School, and the percentage of black males in the program is three times that of the districts that the school draws from. The teacher, who worried that she’d lose her job if she were identified, said that public schools in the area would “send the African-American kids to us for doing things like saying the word ‘shit’ in class or pushing a chair in really loudly. They would never, ever—never in a million years—attempt to come at a white parent with that.”"],["p","The teacher said that students at Coastal Academy were routinely knocked to the floor and restrained. When they couldn’t calm down, they were put in a Refocus Room. “If a student was having a bad day or hadn’t taken his meds, the teacher down the hall from me would park herself in front of the room and the student would stay there all day,” she said. “I heard children shrieking and screaming.” (The program’s director denied that students were knocked to the floor and that the room had been used for seclusion—the state banned seclusion rooms in 2010—and said that some students asked to go there.) When parents complained, the teacher said, “they were met with the same rigmarole: there is a reason why your son is here, and sometimes kids with these conditions make things up.”"],["inline-embed",{"type":"callout","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22callout%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22feature-small%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22image%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522image%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%2522%252Fphotos%252F5ba4050535ba3a2f41406a91%2522%252C%2522width%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522height%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522caption%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%225ba4050535ba3a2f41406a91%5C%22%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%22%2C%22attrs%22%3A%7B%7D%7D","ref":""},["inline-embed",{"type":"image","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22image%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22%2Fphotos%2F5ba4050535ba3a2f41406a91%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":"5ba4050535ba3a2f41406a91"}]],["p","Suzie Dunson, the grandmother of a student in a ",["em",{"class":"small"},"GNETS"]," program called the Woodall Center, in Columbus, said that, when her grandson was in first grade, she stopped by the school one day and found him sitting on the floor, handcuffed to a classroom chair. “He was six years old, and he looked like a chained animal,” she told me. Her grandson routinely came home from school with a swollen face. “I’d ask him, ‘How was school today?’ ‘Oh, I got restrained,’ he’d say.” According to the Woodall Center’s records from the past two years, there were sixteen instances of teachers injuring students while attempting to restrain them. The reports typically blame the student: “In the process of restraining him he twisted his body and hit his head,” one teacher noted. “His face must have rubbed on the ground,” another wrote."],["p","This year, when Dunson’s grandson was sent to a juvenile-detention facility, at the age of eleven, he already had a friend there—a boy from his class. She describes the Woodall Center, where more than half the students are black boys, and ninety-one per cent are classified by the state as “economically disadvantaged,” as a “pipeline-to-prison program.” (A spokeswoman for the Woodall Center said that the school does not have documentation of Dunson’s grandson being handcuffed or regularly restrained.)"],["p","It is not uncommon for students with disabilities to be placed in settings that are unnecessarily isolated, but ",["em",{"class":"small"},"GNETS"]," is unusual in that this form of segregation is sponsored by the state rather than by the school district; families can’t escape it by moving to a new neighborhood. Jatoyia Armour, a public-school teacher in Atlanta, said that when her five-year-old son, Jamir, was referred to ",["em",{"class":"small"},"GNETS"],", “I kept telling myself, ‘This isn’t a race issue. Jamir just has behavioral issues.’ ” She and Jamir had recently moved to an affluent suburb in northern Atlanta so that he would be zoned for a better school. He was the only black boy in his kindergarten class. He had an I.Q. of 120, but he wouldn’t sit still, and had tantrums in which he threw objects. Armour said that the school called the police three times before he was transferred to a ",["em",{"class":"small"},"GNETS"]," program, where the proportion of black boys to other students is nine times that of his elementary school. “When I got to the ",["em",{"class":"small"},"GNETS"]," program, and it was majority black, it was glaring,” Armour told me. “They wanted this little black boy out. And it hurt.” She homeschooled Jamir for the rest of the year and then enrolled him in a charter school, but when the charter school reviewed his records she was told that he had to go back to ",["em",{"class":"small"},"GNETS"],". “I worked hard to move to that area to give my kid the best, and we were pushed back out,” she told me. She worries that Jamir has already internalized the experience. In the past year, he has begun to introduce himself to strangers by saying, “Hi, I’m Jamir, I’m bad.”"],["p","In 2016, under President Barack Obama, the Department of Education instituted the “significant disproportionality rule,” which required states to more vigilantly report when students of color are disciplined and placed in special-education classes at higher rates than their peers. Black students are three times more likely to be suspended or expelled than white students, and although black students make up only nineteen per cent of students with disabilities, they make up thirty-six per cent of those who are mechanically restrained—handcuffed, strapped to a chair, tied down."],["p","The “significant disproportionality rule” was supposed to take effect in the summer of 2017.

Cherry, a tall, elegant black woman who was raising a daughter on her own, had been a special-education teacher for seven years in Gadsden County, Florida, where she was once named Teacher of the Year, before rising to become an administrator of the program. She took the position at Pathways because it paid slightly better than her old job. In a reference, a colleague wrote that Cherry was “a very astute, responsible, earnest, and dependable person.”"],["p","Cherry had not been trained to teach students with autism; neither had her supervisor, a white woman named Jeanene Wallace, the director of all three Pathways centers, who had worked for ",["em",{"class":"small"},"gnets"]," for twenty-one years. Wallace asked a teacher who taught autistic students at another Pathways site if Cherry could observe her classroom for a few hours. “I apologize for having so little ideas, but I just don’t know how to work with these students,” Wallace wrote."],["p","Cherry, who was studious and unaccustomed to wasted time, began applying for new jobs after a week. She encouraged Williams-Brown to look elsewhere, too. “I think you can do something better,” she told her one day, as Seth lay on the floor on his back in a sunny spot by the window. “The way I see this place, it needs to be shut down.”"],["p","The school had installed new surveillance cameras the prior year, after Georgia passed a law—named for a boy whose mother complained that he routinely came home from school bruised—allowing video monitoring equipment in special-education classrooms. A review of close to a hundred hours of classroom surveillance footage, obtained through an Open Records Act request, shows that there was usually about half an hour of instruction in Seth’s class per day. Much of the day was devoted to the drama of whether or not Seth would wear his shoes. He found them uncomfortable, as many autistic children do. When he took them off, he was sent to Cool Down, a desk facing a blank wall. He went to Cool Down several times a day, for up to thirty minutes at a time, for other behaviors that stem from his disability, such as counting to ten in the wrong order, saying “no” repeatedly, or making funny noises."],["p","MaKenzie often expressed affection for Seth when she sensed that he was being maligned. She told him several times a day that she loved him. He typically gravitated to whatever part of the room she was in. Once, after Seth took off his shoes, MaKenzie asked her teachers, “Seth is being bad, ain’t he?”"],["p","“He’s always bad,” Cherry said."],["p","MaKenzie, who liked to take off her shoes, too, sat on

a week, Latoya takes her family to the Gathering Place, a church in a former supermarket in Donalsonville. The pastor gives his sermons in the old meat section, a large cinder-block room with L.E.D. lighting. Seth’s aunts and cousins make up about a quarter of the week-night congregation. When I went with them one evening, Seth sat next to five cousins and shared a folding chair with a friend from the neighborhood, a teen-ager raised in foster care who treated Seth like a little brother. As they waited for the service to start, Seth leaned on the boy’s shoulder and watched the other kids while chewing on the collar of his shirt. The pastor made announcements on a microphone, and Seth began silently weeping. He often cried when he heard loud noises. Once the congregation began singing, though, Seth stood up, closed his eyes, bowed his head, and hummed along to the melody. He danced and clapped with the other kids, but a little more vigorously."],["p","In school, Seth was more agitated. He increasingly seemed to embody everything that his teachers resented about their jobs, and they talked about him as if he couldn’t comprehend language. “You’re about three grade levels behind, and you think you’re going to have a career?” Williams-Brown said one day, as Seth sat in Cool Down, where he’d been sent for not listening to a story.

pleaded guilty. Bainbridge’s courthouse is across the street from the board of education, and both buildings overlook a small courtyard with two monuments dedicated to Confederate soldiers. At the sentencing hearing, the state solicitor general, Benjamin Harrell, a young, white attorney, played the clips of Cherry hitting Seth and reënacting the encounter the next day. “Praise the Lord for modern technology that allowed us to discover what was really going on in a school here,” he said."],["p","When Cherry testified, she sounded as if she were talking to a job supervisor. “It was definitely inappropriate,” she said. “It was a mistake, and it happened, and it won’t happen again.”"],["p","Latoya could barely talk at the hearing, because she was crying so hard. “I no longer have a best friend, because one of those teachers was my best friend’s mama,” she testified. “She didn’t even come tell me. These people from Donalsonville—nobody came to my house.” When Harrell asked her what she thought Cherry’s sentence should be, she said, “I think that Ms. Cherry should get jail time.” She went on, “It’s sickening that two black women—and you already know the struggle that black people have—that you would do that to your own kind.”"],["p","The judge sentenced Cherry to a year in jail. Williams-Brown, who attended the hearing, said that, when she heard the sentence, “I cried and I cried and I cried and I cried and I cried.” She thought that Cherry wouldn’t have been punished so severely if she’d been white, but, she said, “I try not to get caught up in that.” Cherry’s mother, Pat Grant, told me, “I am just so discombobulated. My daughter didn’t get her master’s degree to babysit a child. She was on track to become a principal.”"],["p","Phyllis Rambo, who had worked for the school district for nearly two decades, was fired. Williams-Brown, who also pleaded guilty, was sentenced to probation. Harrell told me, “I saw a lot of outrage that there wasn’t more that could be done against them. People around here said, specifically, that all three women in the video were equally bad. They were saying that they should get life. Or even death.”"],["p","In an e-mail to the superintendent, Wallace complained that Harrell was “out of control,” and said that people were calling Rambo on the phone and threatening her. Rambo’s daughter Daneisha told me, “It’s tragic. Both parties are hurting—the guilty party and the not-guilty party.”"],["p","Latoya rarely left her house. “We all live in the same community, and—ooh, it’s the worst feeling I’ve ever felt,” she said. Her sister-in-law overheard women at church saying that Latoya should be ashamed of herself for ruining her neighbors’ careers. Her brother Nathan, who works at a jail, said that he heard a correction officer telling another officer, “If I were that teacher, I probably would have done the same

Cheryl Fields-Smith, a professor at the University of Georgia, studies why black families in Georgia increasingly make this choice. “One of the dominant themes was a desire to protect their children from being labelled a troublemaker, or having a special-education label placed on them,” she told me. According to the Department of Education, students of color are roughly twice as likely to be identified as having an emotional disorder as white children and nearly three times as likely to be labelled cognitively impaired. (In 2015, four decades of research was challenged by a widely cited series of articles by Paul Morgan, a professor of education at Penn State, and George Farkas, a professor at the University of California, Irvine, who argued that if environmental factors, such as poverty and single parenthood, are taken into account, students of color are actually underrepresented in special education. But other scholars have criticized the authors for overgeneralizing and relying on variables that could be subject to racial bias.)"],["p","Chris Vance, a special-education attorney in Atlanta, said that parents who can afford a lawyer’s fees are usually successful in fighting to prevent their children from going to ",["em",{"class":"small"},"GNETS"],". They will often hire a psychologist to analyze the student’s behavior in class and then draft a plan that allows the student to stay in the general classroom for most of the day and work with an aide who has been trained to understand how the student’s disability affects the way he learns. But, she said, “those who can’t afford an attorney will often homeschool their children, and so it becomes no education.”"]],["inline-embed",{"type":"section","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22section%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cp%3ELatoya%20begins%20Seth%E2%80%99s%20lessons%20at%20eight%20each%20morning%20with%20the%20song%20%E2%80%9CJesus%20Loves%20Me%2C%E2%80%9D%20which%20he%20sings%20exuberantly%2C%20clapping%20and%20stomping%20his%20feet.%20On%20a%20recent%20morning%2C%20Latoya%20sat%20on%20the%20floor%20with%20a%20pile%20of%20frayed%20manila%20folders%20from%20Easy%20Peazy%2C%20an%20online%20Christian%20homeschooling%20curriculum%20that%20MaKenzie%E2%80%99s%20cousin%20uses.%20Latoya%E2%80%99s%20mother%2C%20who%20recently%20had%20a%20stroke%2C%20was%20on%20the%20sofa%20watching%20TV.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3ELatoya%20instructed%20Seth%20to%20recite%20words%20pictured%20on%20flash%20cards.%20Repeating%20the%20words%20required%20a%20vigorous%20windup%3A%20Seth%20arched%20his%20back%2C%20pumped%20his%20arms%20in%20the%20air%2C%20and%20then%20shouted%20out%20the%20words%20so%20loudly%20that%20his%20five-year-old%20cousin%2C%20Keylan%2C%20who%20came%20to%20the%20lesson%20uninvited%2C%20covered%20his%20ears.%20When%20Latoya%20told%20him%20that%20he%E2%80%99d%20done%20a%20good%20job%2C%20he%20clapped%20and%20yelled%2C%20%E2%80%9CYay%2C%20yay%2C%20yay%2C%20yay!%E2%80%9D%20The%20celebration%20went%20on%20for%20too%20long.%20%E2%80%9CLearn!%E2%80%9D%20his%20sister%2C%20Sahrenety%2C%20who%20was%20on%20summer%20vacation%2C%20told%20him.%20%E2%80%9CDo%20your%20work.%E2%80%9D%20She%20sat%20on%20the%20couch%20next%20to%20Latoya%E2%80%99s%20niece%2C%20who%20also%20gave%20Seth%20pep%20talks.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EAfter%20declaring%20that%20%E2%80%9CI%E2%80%9D%20is%20for%20igloo%2C%20Seth%20began%20rolling%20on%20the%20ground.%20Latoya%20called%20her%20brother%20Lawrence%2C%20and%20put%20him%20on%20speakerphone.%20He%20usually%20came%20over%20to%20play%20basketball%20when%20the%20lesson%20was%20over%2C%20around%20ten-thirty.%20%E2%80%9CI%20won%E2%80%99t%20come%20if%20you%20don%E2%80%99t%20learn%2C%E2%80%9D%20Lawrence%20repeatedly%20warned%20Seth.%20Seth%20got%20to%20%E2%80%9CK%E2%80%9D%20before%20everyone%20gave%20up.%20Latoya%20was%20sweating%2C%20and%20her%20niece%20was%20snoring%20loudly%20on%20the%20couch.%20A%20few%20of%20Latoya%E2%80%99s%20customers%20were%20already%20in%20the%20kitchen.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3ELatoya%20realizes%20that%20she%20cannot%20keep%20homeschooling%20Seth%2C%20and%20she%20plans%20to%20move%20back%20to%20Atlanta%20next%20month.%20She%20wants%20Seth%20to%20attend%20a%20public%20school%20where%20the%20day%20is%20structured%20and%20predictable%20and%20the%20classroom%20aides%20understand%20the%20sensory%20triggers%20for%20his%20outbursts.%20She%20doesn%E2%80%99t%20mind%20if%20he%E2%80%99s%20in%20a%20special-education%20classroom%2C%20provided%20he%20has%20some%20contact%20with%20nondisabled%20students%20during%20the%20day.%20She%E2%80%99s%20not%20even%20opposed%20to%20the%20idea%20of%20eventually%20placing%20him%20in%20a%20school%20for%20children%20with%20autism%2C%20as%20long%20as%20the%20segregation%20serves%20a%20therapeutic%20purpose.%20She%20discovered%20a%20specialized%20school%20north%20of%20Atlanta%2C%20the%20Lionheart%20School%2C%20that%20she%20aspires%20to%20send%20Seth%20to%20one%20day%2C%20if%20she%20can%20afford%20it.%20The%20director%20of%20the%20school%20told%20me%2C%20%E2%80%9CWhen%20people%20talk%20about%20%E2%80%98behaviors%2C%E2%80%99%20the%20assumption%20is%20that%20the%20child%20is%20doing%20something%20bad%2C%20but%20we%20see%20behaviors%20as%20communicative.%20If%20the%20child%20is%20punished%20for%20screaming%2C%20then%20we%E2%80%99ve%20missed%20an%20opportunity%20to%20get%20to%20know%20this%20child%20and%20what%20he%20is%20telling%20us.%E2%80%9D%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EMore%20than%20anything%2C%20Latoya%20wants%20to%20get%20out%20of%20Donalsonville.%20She%20told%20me%2C%20%E2%80%9CI%20feel%20like%20everybody%20here%20is%20looking%20at%20me%2C%20like%2C%20Why%20would%20she%20do%20that%20to%20those%20teachers%3F%20She%20knows%20her%20son%20is%20bad.%E2%80%9D%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EWhenever%20Latoya%20goes%20to%20town%2C%20she%20must%20drive%20past%20Phyllis%20Rambo%E2%80%99s%20house.%20Recently%2C%20when%20we%20passed%20it%2C%20her%20sister%20Cecelia%2C%20who%20was%20driving%2C%20became%20sombre.%20%E2%80%9CThat%E2%80%99s%20Phyllis%2C%E2%80%9D%20she%20said%2C%20pointing%20to%20a%20one-story%20brick%20house.%20Behind%20the%20house%20was%20an%20old%20swing%20set%20where%20Latoya%20used%20to%20play%20with%20Rambo%E2%80%99s%20daughter%20Daneisha.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3ELatoya%20had%20started%20talking%20to%20Daneisha%20again%2C%20after%20Daneisha%20wrote%20her%20a%20letter%20describing%20how%20important%20their%20friendship%20was%20to%20her.%20For%20months%2C%20friends%20from%20their%20neighborhood%20had%20been%20urging%20her%20to%20forgive%20Rambo%2C%20too%2C%20and%20over%20time%20Latoya%20had%20begun%20to%20soften%20toward%20her.%20%E2%80%9CI%20think%20Phyllis%20was%20basically%20just%20trying%20to%20fit%20in%2C

begins Seth’s lessons at eight each morning with the song “Jesus Loves Me,” which he sings exuberantly, clapping and stomping his feet. On a recent morning, Latoya sat on the floor with a pile of frayed manila folders from Easy Peazy, an online Christian homeschooling curriculum that MaKenzie’s cousin uses. Latoya’s mother, who recently had a stroke, was on the sofa watching TV."],["p","Latoya instructed Seth to recite words pictured on flash cards. Repeating the words required a vigorous windup: Seth arched his back, pumped his arms in the air, and then shouted out the words so loudly that his five-year-old cousin, Keylan, who came to the lesson uninvited, covered his ears. When Latoya told him that he’d done a good job, he clapped and yelled, “Yay, yay, yay, yay!” The celebration went on for too long. “Learn!” his sister, Sahrenety, who was on summer vacation, told him. “Do your work.” She sat on the couch next to Latoya’s niece, who also gave Seth pep talks."],["p","After declaring that “I” is for igloo, Seth began rolling on the ground. Latoya called her brother Lawrence, and put him on speakerphone. He usually came over to play basketball when the lesson was over, around ten-thirty. “I won’t come if you don’t learn,” Lawrence repeatedly warned Seth. Seth got to “K” before everyone gave up. Latoya was sweating, and her niece was snoring loudly on the couch. A few of Latoya’s customers were already in the kitchen."],["p","Latoya realizes that she cannot keep homeschooling Seth, and she plans to move back to Atlanta next month. She wants Seth to attend a public school where the day is structured and predictable and the classroom aides understand the sensory triggers for his outbursts. She doesn’t mind if he’s in a special-education classroom, provided he has some contact with nondisabled students during the day. She’s not even opposed to the idea of eventually placing him in a school for children with autism, as long as the segregation serves a therapeutic purpose. She discovered a specialized school north of Atlanta, the Lionheart School, that she aspires to send Seth to one day, if she can afford it. The director of the school told me, “When people talk about ‘behaviors,’ the assumption is that the child is doing something bad, but we see behaviors as communicative. If the child is punished for screaming, then we’ve missed an opportunity to get to know this child and what he is telling us.”"],["p","More than anything, Latoya wants to get out of Donalsonville.

She knows her son is bad.”"],["p","Whenever Latoya goes to town, she must drive past Phyllis Rambo’s house.

For months, friends from their neighborhood had been urging her to forgive Rambo, too, and over time Latoya had begun to soften toward her. “I think Phyllis was basically just trying to fit in,” she told me. “She needed people to vent to at work.” (Rambo did not want to talk to me.)"],["p","Latoya had never been close with Melissa Williams-Brown—Latoya described her as having been, in high school, part of the “fancy crowd, the kids who basically have what you call a good life”—but, as she had learned more about the ",["em",{"class":"small"},"GNETS"]," system, she had begun to see Williams-Brown’s mistakes in a different light. “I’m not upset with Melissa,” she told me. “I’m not even upset with Ms. Cherry.

When Erica parked in front of Latoya’s house, MaKenzie looked up from a magazine and saw Seth sitting under the carport, beside a washing machine."],["p","“I love you, Seth,” she said, as she walked up the driveway. “I love this little boy.” She combed her fingers through his dreadlocks and commented on how long they had grown. He looked away, smiling. Then he walked toward his uncle, who was mowing the lawn. MaKenzie stood still, wringing her hands. “What’s wrong with you?” she said gently."],["p","Erica apologized to Latoya in advance for the language that MaKenzie might use. “When she’s nervous, her words really come out,” she said. “Whatever is on Kenzie’s mind she’s going to tell you.” It quickly became clear that one of the words that MaKenzie had difficulty controlling was the N-word. Erica was accustomed to people making comments like “That little girl needs her butt tore up.” But Latoya assured her that it was fine, even when Seth began repeating the word."],["p","In the carport, they listened to the country song “Meant to Be,” by Bebe Rexha and the Florida Georgia Line. MaKenzie stood under a tree and swayed her arms in the air. Seth walked over to her and began doing the two-step, rocking his hips and shoulders from side to side. Their rhythms were familiar to each other; they had often danced together at school, while their teachers were talking. On Cherry’s last day at Pathways, MaKenzie had sashayed toward Seth, stood behind him, and begun moving his arms to the beat of a nursery song, leading him in a kind of square dance."],["p","Throughout the afternoon, MaKenzie repeatedly told Seth that she loved him and kissed his cheek or the top of his head. Latoya took solace in believing that MaKenzie’s warmth may have counteracted the harsh tone of his teachers. She was less concerned about the physical violence than about the effects of listening to them talk. “He can hear five conversations at a time and remember every word—that’s one of his autistic traits,” she told me. “If you call him bad, he’s going to believe it. He’s going to become exactly who you say he is.” ♦"],["p","A previous version of this article cited imprecise critiques by scholars who said that gender had been omitted from Morgan and Farkas’s analysis.

are few gestures of mainstream embrace quite like an invitation to Buckingham Palace. In March, ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/prince-william"},"Prince William"]," made Richard Kylea Cowie, better known as the rapper and producer Wiley, a Member of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (M.B.E.), for his contributions to the arts. This wasn’t a case of the fusty establishment pandering to a hot new hitmaker. Wiley, who is thirty-nine, has been releasing music since 1996, though he has topped the U.K. singles chart just once. In the early two-thousands, he helped pioneer the British musical subculture known as ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/rabit-and-the-resurgence-of-grime"},"grime"],". Grime originated in East London, and was created by young people who were inspired by hip-hop’s cold swagger and the hyperactivity of dance music but were beholden to neither. Instead, they made music that sounded fresh and bizarre, as if they were tiptoeing through an alien invasion—a raucous collision of exasperated, rapid-fire raps, all-levelling bass lines, and twitchy video-game bleeps. This isn’t hyperbole; early grime beats were often made on gaming consoles."],["p","After the ceremony, Wiley reflected on the unlikeliness of it all, recalling a time when he assumed that the royals “would never know us.” Grime, after all, had evolved in the shadows, a product of, and a response to, government neglect. At first, it lived primarily on pirate radio, that great British tradition in which people scale the tallest building they can find and hide makeshift transmitters. In the eighties and early nineties, new strains of dance music, like hardcore rave and jungle, evolved on such stations. In part, grime was a reaction to how posh the world of dance music had become by the late nineties. I first heard the genre on a forty-minute MP3 file, in which Wiley went back and forth with Dizzee Rascal, another early grime hero, at blistering speed. They didn’t conceal their accents—something that European rappers of the eighties and nineties often did. They didn’t even seem to be stopping for breath. I couldn’t tell whether they were rapping over beats or over windows being shattered, or even malfunctioning car horns."],["p","In “",["a",{"href":"https://www.amazon.com/Inner-City-Pressure-Story-Grime/dp/0008257132"},"Inner City Pressure: The Story of Grime"],",” the British journalist Dan Hancox describes the sound of those early days as having “crash-landed in the present with no past, and no future.” His book draws on more than a decade of interviews with many of grime’s most important lyricists, producers, d.j.s, and promoters. Hancox writes with a fan’s zeal, recounting the rush of hearing paradigm-shifting singles for the first time, and the pride of seeing underdogs like Wiley and Skepta ascend to superstardom. At first, there was little hope that these songs, which sounded like crude moments of catharsis, would ever travel beyond their neighborhoods. These were anthems for clubs that did not exist, with the hiss of ungrounded wires discernible in the background. “We were just having the best time ever,” Wiley told Hancox."],["p","A turning point came in 2003, when Dizzee Rascal, who was nineteen years old, won the Mercury Prize, England’s most prestigious music award, for his début album, “Boy in da Corner.” Dizzee had a talent for cold, wobbly beats, and he rapped with a kind of prissy flamboyance. He represented a different kind of pop star, and his lyrics, which provided glimpses into a different way of life, proved shocking to many. (Two weeks before his album came out, he was stabbed six times, possibly by a rival hip-hop crew.)"],["p","As he and other grime artists vied for pop success, their music slowed down, rechannelling some of the raw furor it had started out with. By the late aughts, the mainstream view was that grime’s moment had passed. Hancox disagrees, pointing out how singles like Lethal Bizzle’s “Pow!” and Tempa T’s “Next Hype” lived on, as soundtracks for a movement protesting rising school tuition. Hancox’s book is distinguished by his background in urbanism and politics. His previous book was about Marinaleda, a utopian-sounding Spanish village where citizens live coöperatively, and he’s written extensively on anti-capitalist activism. Consequently, he situates grime, particularly the lean years after Dizzee, Wiley, and others became stars, within a larger story of rampant development and gentrification. The spaces that had produced grime had shrunk, and become more suffocating, thanks in part to London’s heavy investment in surveillance technologies. One of the legacies of the 2012 Olympics was the so-called rejuvenation of the East End, including Wiley and Dizzee’s old neighborhood, Bow. As grime artists were absorbed into the city’s cultural marketing plan—Dizzee recorded one of the official songs of the Games—the hooded sweatshirts and, in the parlance of London policing, the “antisocial behavior” of their young fans came under increased scrutiny."]],["inline-embed",{"type":"section","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22section%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cp%3EWhen%20Wiley%20accepted%20his%20M.B.E.%2C%20he%20tipped%20his%20hat%20to%20Stormzy%2C%20a%20younger%20London%20artist%20whose%20d%C3%A9but%20album%2C%20%E2%80%9CGang%20Signs%20%26amp%3B%20Prayer%2C%E2%80%9D%20won%20the%202018%20Brit%20Award%20for%20British%20Album%20of%20the%20Year%E2%80%94a%20category%20dominated%20for%20decades%20by%20rock%20acts.%20Grime%20is%20no%20longer%20an%20expression%20of%20what%20Hancox%20terms%20%E2%80%9Cneighborhood%20nationalism.%E2%80%9D%20Now%20those%20musicians%20speak%20to%20wider%20constituencies%2C%20as%20in%20the%20wake%20of%20the%20Grenfell%20Tower%20fire%2C%20when%20artists%20like%20Stormzy%2C%20AJ%20Tracey%2C%20and%20Novelist%20voiced%20the%20frustration%20shared%20by%20many%20toward%20England%E2%80%99s%20Conservative%20leadership.%20Last%20year%2C%20there%20was%20even%20%23grime4corbyn%2C%20the%20occasionally%20awkward%20attempt%20by%20scene%20veterans%20like%20JME%20to%20encourage%20young%20people%20to%20support%20Jeremy%20Corbyn%2C%20the%20Labour%20Party%E2%80%99s%20candidate%20for%20Prime%20Minister.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EStill%2C%20the%20instinct%20toward%20street-corner%20tribalism%20runs%20deep.%20Now%20turf%20is%20claimed%20in%20other%20styles.%20In%20the%20past%20few%20years%2C%20the%20hysteria%20and%20the%20moral%20panic%20that%20once%20surrounded%20grime%20has%20drifted%20toward%20U.K.%20drill%2C%20which%20began%20around%202012%20as%20a%20London-centric%20take%20on%20the%20dark%2C%20deadpan%20music%20coming%20out%20of%20Chicago.%20Where%20grime%20is%20verbose%20and%20cathartic%2C%20U.K.%20drill%20traffics%20in%20a%20cool%20heartlessness%2C%20a%20sense%20of%20menace%20that%20wafts%20and%20oozes.%20Authorities%20have%20been%20troubled%20by%20drill%E2%80%99s%20singular%20lyrical%20fixation%20on%20slashings%20and%20stabbings%2C%20and%20by%20episodes%20in%20which%20gang%20attacks%20were%20prompted%2C%20if%20not%20prophesied%2C%20by%20songs.%20U.K.%20drill%20is%20unusually%20grim%2C%20suffused%20with%20a%20nihilism%20that%20expects%20little%20of%20tomorrow.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EIn%20June%2C%20a%20court%20order%20was%20issued%20prohibiting%20the%20London%20group%201011%20from%20mentioning%20violence%20or%20certain%20postal%20codes%20in%20their%20lyrics.%20The%20relationship%20between%20real%20life%20and%20art%20is%20a%20messy%20one%2C%20and%20it%E2%80%99s%20always%20easier%20to%20regulate%20the%20latter.%20It%E2%80%99s%20much%20harder%20to%20disentangle%20the%20out-of-control%20kids%20from%20the%20world%20they%E2%80%99ve%20grown%20up%20in%2C%20to%20determine%20whether%20music%20is%20a%20salve%20for%20misery%20or%20a%20spur%20to%20it.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%22%7D","ref":""},["p","When Wiley accepted his M.B.E., he tipped his hat to Stormzy, a younger London artist whose début album, “Gang Signs &amp; Prayer,” won the 2018 Brit Award for British Album of the Year—a category dominated for decades by rock acts. Grime is no longer an expression of what Hancox terms “neighborhood nationalism.” Now those musicians speak to wider constituencies, as in the wake of the Grenfell Tower fire, when artists like Stormzy, AJ Tracey, and Novelist voiced the frustration shared by many toward England’s Conservative leadership. Last year, there was even #grime4corbyn, the occasionally awkward attempt by scene veterans like JME to encourage young people to support Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour Party’s candidate for Prime Minister."],["p","Still, the instinct toward street-corner tribalism runs deep. Now turf is claimed in other styles. In the past few years, the hysteria and the moral panic that once surrounded grime has drifted toward U.K. drill, which began around 2012 as a London-centric take on the dark, deadpan music coming out of Chicago. Where grime is verbose and cathartic, U.K. drill traffics in a cool heartlessness, a sense of menace that wafts and oozes. Authorities have been troubled by drill’s singular lyrical fixation on slashings and stabbings, and by episodes in which gang attacks were prompted, if not prophesied, by songs. U.K. drill is unusually grim, suffused with a nihilism that expects little of tomorrow."],["p","In June, a court order was issued prohibiting the London group 1011 from mentioning violence or certain postal codes in their lyrics. The relationship between real life and art is a messy one, and it’s always easier to regulate the latter. It’s much harder to disentangle the out-of-control kids from the world they’ve grown up in, to determine whether music is a salve for misery or a spur to it."]],["inline-embed",{"type":"section","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22section%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cp%3EThe%20Pittsburgh%20rapper%20%3Ca%20href%3D%5C%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fculture%2Fpostscript%2Fthe-tragic-death-of-mac-miller-a-musician-who-never-stopped-evolving%5C%22%3EMac%20Miller%3C%2Fa%3E%2C%20who%20died%20in%20early%20September%2C%20often%20spoke%20of%20the%20difficulty%20of%20living%20up%20to%20his%20fun-loving%2C%20try-everything%20persona.%20In%20the%20course%20of%20his%20career%2C%20he%20grew%20increasingly%20vexed%20by%20the%20reality%20he%20had%20made%20for%20himself.%20When%20he%20first%20emerged%2C%20as%20a%20teen-ager%2C%20he%20was%20often%20dismissed%20as%20a%20novelty%2C%20a%20goofy%20white%20kid%20making%20tunes%20for%20all-night%20frat%20parties.%20He%20smiled%20while%20he%20rapped%2C%20a%20trait%20that%20initially%20seemed%20suspect%2C%20as%20though%20he%20were%20getting%20away%20with%20something.%20But%2C%20as%20his%20career%20evolved%2C%20that%20smile%20came%20to%20express%20a%20kind%20of%20awe%2C%20a%20sense%20of%20wonder%20at%20what%20he%E2%80%99d%20become%20as%20an%20artist.%20Miller%20began%20to%20use%20his%20scratchy%2C%20cocksure%20voice%20differently%2C%20his%20raps%20growing%20more%20singsong%2C%20as%20a%20way%20of%20deciphering%20his%20ever-changing%20moods.%20He%20began%20to%20write%20songs%20about%20pain%20and%20addiction%2C%20and%20he%20composed%20an%20album%20about%20the%20lessons%20he%20had%20learned%20from%20the%20women%20in%20his%20life.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EPerhaps%20there%20were%20some%20aspects%20of%20life%20that%20even%20art%20could%20not%20help%20him%20adapt%20to.%20Miller%20is%20the%20latest%20in%20a%20recent%20string%20of%20musicians%20(the%20E.D.M.%20producer%20%3Ca%20href%3D%5C%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fculture%2Fpostscript%2Fthe-edm-star-avicii-dies-too-soon%5C%22%3EAvicii%3C%2Fa%3E%2C%20the%20rapper%20%3Ca%20href%3D%5C%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fmagazine%2F2018%2F01%2F08%2Flil-xan-and-the-year-in-sad-rap%5C%22%3ELil%20Peep%3C%2Fa%3E%2C%20%3Ca%20href%3D%5C%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fmagazine%2F2018%2F06%2F25%2Fpaisley-park-princes-lonely-palace%5C%22%3EPrince%3C%2Fa%3E%2C%20and%20%3Ca%20href%3D%5C%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fculture%2Fculture-desk%2Ffree-falling-with-tom-petty%5C%22%3ETom%20Petty%3C%2Fa%3E%20whose%20deaths%20are%20likely%20linked%20to%20opioid%20abuse.%20I%20was%20surprised%20to%20learn%20that%20Miller%20was%20only%20twenty-six%3B%20it%20seemed%20as%20if%20he%E2%80%99d%20been%20around%20much%20longer.%20If%20it%20seemed%20that%20way%20to%20me%2C%20following%20the%20ups%20and%20downs%20of%20his%20career%2C%20I%20can%E2%80%99t%20imagine%20what%20it%20felt%20like%20to%20him.%20By%20the%20time%20his%20fifth%20album%2C%20%E2%80%9CSwimming%2C%E2%80%9D%20was%20released%2C%20last%20month%2C%20he%20seemed%20like%20an%20old%20soul.%20In%20the%20shadow%20of%20real%20life%2C%20the%20raspy%2C%20carefree%20funk%20of%20%E2%80%9CWhat%E2%80%99s%20the%20Use%3F%E2%80%9D%20now%20feels%20aspirational%2C%20the%20bluesy%20pride%20of%20%E2%80%9CSelf%20Care%E2%80%9D%20somehow%20insufficient.%20Yet%20%E2%80%9CSwimming%E2%80%9D%20remains%20an%20expression%20of%20wonder%20and%20contentment%2C%20no%20matter%20how%20fleeting.%20%E2%80%9CThe%20world%20is%20so%20small%2C%E2%80%9D%20he%20raps%2C%20on%20a%20gentle%20tease%20of%20a%20song%20called%20%E2%80%9CSmall%20Worlds%2C%E2%80%9D%20%E2%80%9Cuntil%20it%20ain%E2%80%99t.%E2%80%9D%20In%20the%20sound%20of%20Miller%E2%80%99s%20playful%20sneer%2C%20the%20entirety%20of%20that%20vast%2C%20humbling%20world%20comes%20into%20focus.%C2%A0%E2%99%A6%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%22%7D","ref":""},["p","The Pittsburgh rapper ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/postscript/the-tragic-death-of-mac-miller-a-musician-who-never-stopped-evolving"},"Mac Miller"],", who died in early September, often spoke of the difficulty of living up to his fun-loving, try-everything persona. In the course of his career, he grew increasingly vexed by the reality he had made for himself. When he first emerged, as a teen-ager, he was often dismissed as a novelty, a goofy white kid making tunes for all-night frat parties. He smiled while he rapped, a trait that initially seemed suspect, as though he were getting away with something. But, as his career evolved, that smile came to express a kind of awe, a sense of wonder at what he’d become as an artist. Miller began to use his scratchy, cocksure voice differently, his raps growing more singsong, as a way of deciphering his ever-changing moods. He began to write songs about pain and addiction, and he composed an album about the lessons he had learned from the women in his life."],["p","Perhaps there were some aspects of life that even art could not help him adapt to. Miller is the latest in a recent string of musicians (the E.D.M. producer ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/postscript/the-edm-star-avicii-dies-too-soon"},"Avicii"],", the rapper ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/01/08/lil-xan-and-the-year-in-sad-rap"},"Lil Peep"],", ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/06/25/paisley-park-princes-lonely-palace"},"Prince"],", and ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/free-falling-with-tom-petty"},"Tom Petty"]," whose deaths are likely linked to opioid abuse. I was surprised to learn that Miller was only twenty-six; it seemed as if he’d been around much longer. If it seemed that way to me, following the ups and downs of his career, I can’t imagine what it felt like to him. By the time his fifth album, “Swimming,” was released, last month, he seemed like an old soul. In the shadow of real life, the raspy, carefree funk of “What’s the Use?” now feels aspirational, the bluesy pride of “Self Care” somehow insufficient. Yet “Swimming” remains an expression of wonder and contentment, no matter how fleeting. “The world is so small,” he raps, on a gentle tease of a song called “Small Worlds,” “until it ain’t.” In the sound of Miller’s playful sneer, the entirety of that vast, humbling world comes into focus. ♦"]]],"canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"sections":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"},"slug":"magazine","children":[{"id":"59112013df652b705f4ab93f","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"59112013df652b705f4ab93f","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Pop Music","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"pop-music"},{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"},{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"}],"name":"Pop Music","parent":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"},"slug":"pop-music"}]}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"magazine","contentTags":[],"contentType":"article","contributors":[{"name":"Hua Hsu","type":"author","title":"Hua Hsu began contributing to \u003cem&gt;The New Yorker\u003c/em&gt; in 2014, and became a staff writer in 2017.","email":"","bio":["div",["p","Hua Hsu began contributing to ",["em","The New Yorker"]," in 2014, and became a\nstaff writer in 2017.

They are the parents of Colette, who, on a recent Thursday, wriggled in a stroller parked in the dining room of the family’s Tribeca apartment. “We’re waiting for her high chair to come,” Jessica, who is twenty-eight, said. She wore baggy jeans with holes in them and a Marlboro T-shirt."],["p","The front door opened. “What’s up?” Elliot said, coolly. “",["em","Hi,"]," Colettey!” he added. Twenty-seven and lanky, he wore a black T-shirt, black jeans, and a black baseball cap. He and Jessica grew up near Coney Island, part of the same Syrian Jewish community, and began dating in 2011. Elliot had dropped out of Hunter College and was working at a cell-phone resale business owned by his older brother, Maurice. “I hated it, obviously,” he said."],["p","“He was miserable,” Jessica agreed. (She was a personal shopper.) “But that’s kind of why FuckJerry existed.”"],["p","After work, Elliot would flop down on his couch and upload images to a Tumblr blog that he’d named Fuck Jerry, because he created it while half watching “Seinfeld” reruns. It was a place to collect “things that were cool: architecture, design, art, a lot of sneakers,” he said."],["p","He noticed that Kramer quips got more likes than vintage Nikes. When Instagram launched, he moved Fuck Jerry there. “It was the same hustle, continually posting, curating content,” he said. By 2013, he had enough followers to quit the cell-phone business. The next year, Jessica started BeigeCardigan—the name comes from Urban Dictionary’s term for a bland housewife—“As a joke,” she said. “He was always on his phone.” She swiftly accrued a hundred thousand followers. “That was the beginning of this network effect,” Elliot said."],["p","Now they’re both always on their phones. “There’s no vacation,” Elliot said. Even their babymoon, last October, begat work when they ran into Kim Kardashian and Kanye West at a Utah resort. The Wests invited them to their table to talk online marketing. “I had to go to the bathroom and scream into a towel, I was so excited,” Jessica said."],["p","What about the hospital delivery room, during Colette’s birth? “Elliot was posting away,” Jessica recalled. “I didn’t touch my phone for, like, two months.” Now she takes at least one day off every week. “She doesn’t post on Shabbos,” Elliot said."],["p","“There are days where he’ll be, like, ‘Jessica, you didn’t post today! I’m going to post this now,’ ” Jessica said."],["p","“It’s stressful,” Elliot said. “It’s not like I have a bucket of content to pick from. Some days, I’ll spend hours looking for the next post.”"],["p","Jessica plucked Colette from her stroller and carried her to the living room, passing a six-by-five-foot pointillist portrait of Kim Jong Un. The painting is part of a series by Mathieu Malouf titled “Toxic Masculinity Fallout Shelter.” (Other subjects: the Grinch, Donald Trump.) “My cousin is an art consultant, so she tells me what to invest in,” Elliot explained. “But of course people walk in and say, ‘Why the fuck do you have a portrait of Kim Jong Un?’ ”"],["p","“I hate it,” Jessica said."],["p","“I love it,” Elliot said.

In the game, players create their own memes by pairing images with funny captions (a Botticelli goddess holding up her hand with the text “bitch please”). “My vision is to become the New Age Hasbro,” Elliot said. “Games are a great way for people to get off their phones, hang out, laugh.” Another swig. “At this point, I’m so sick of the Internet,” he went on. “It has its moments, but, gosh, I’m a slave to it.”"],["p","“Poor Elliot,” Jessica said, laughing."],["p","“It’s given me everything that I have, so I can’t say I hate it. But it’s work.”"],["p","Jessica sighed. “I can’t wait till the day that you don’t need the Internet,” she said.

After standing on the porch for a minute and then another minute, Jiayu and Chris sat down on two wicker chairs, a small round table with a potted yellow chrysanthemum between them. It was a cloudless day, the sky intensely blue. A pair of squirrels were chasing each other on the lawn, and some unseen birds in the trees, which had yet to change colors, made loud noises, a game of hue and cry in the quiet neighborhood. Perhaps the real setting of every Shakespeare play, Jiayu thought, is a wall-less waiting room like this: life as an antechamber to death."],["p","That thought, four months later, struck Jiayu as unnecessarily theatrical. Who was she to talk about Shakespeare, when the last time she had read him was in college, in Beijing, for an English degree she had made little use of? Now, when Jiayu thought about the sun-soaked days immediately after Evan’s death, she realized that the woman whose voice she and Chris had heard through the intercom on that first and subsequent visits had never appeared in person. There was no front desk at the funeral home. Every time the door had opened, it was the funeral director’s handshake they’d encountered. The first time Jiayu had phoned, the soft-spoken man had said, “Oh, God,” after he had asked for Evan’s date of birth and received the answer."],["p","But the voice on the intercom belonged to someone, a receptionist who did not need a nametag. And she’d be spared meeting with all those clients, day in and day out, who never would have set foot in the house were it not for death’s mandate. Jiayu had never previously given a moment of thought to the receptionist in any other office. Yet this unmet woman, having remained faceless, refused to be reduced to a generic receptionist. The dead, too, should never become generally and generically dead, but that, Jiayu had realized as she read a recent article on the alarming statistics of teen-age suicides, was a futile

brought a new routine. There were grief support groups to join, letters from relatives and friends to attend to, pleading phone calls to make to Naomi, who was a college sophomore in Wisconsin and who, after the funeral, had begun to limit her parents’ access to her life. This new, flimsy routine reminded Jiayu of her first transistor radio, a birthday present from her grandfather when she turned five. It was a luxury for a five-year-old. Frustrating, too, since it was not easy for her fingers to maneuver the dial to find the one station with a half-hour afternoon preschool program. And, when she did succeed, the dial stayed at the right frequency for no more than a few minutes before it began to shift, and the songs about the thieving foxes and partying bears would drift into static."],["p","How did that girl with the radio in her lap become this woman, in the middle of her life, with so many dials failing? Sometimes Jiayu parked her car in front of the garage door, unable to push the button to open it. Other times, she cleaned the house tirelessly, or chopped onions until they became a translucent puddle of tears on the cutting board. Why she balked at the garage door or ill-used the onions she did not ask, because the answer was a given. Any action, any feeling, erratic or not, fell under the all-encompassing umbrella called grief."],["p","Grief? What is grief? One morning when Jiayu opened her eyes she said to the ceiling, Grief, I don’t know who you are, so don’t pretend you know who I am."],["p","She and Chris went back to work right after the funeral. Jiayu administered cultural-exchange projects at the public university in a neighboring town. Chris managed the medical-engineering department at a local hospital. Both had struggled at first, Chris leaving work a few times, Jiayu hiding in the ladies’ room and weeping for two days in a row, but they carried on with a steadiness that appeared stoic to the world. Jiayu tidied up their garden and planted the autumn bulbs before the first frost. Chris winterized the irrigation system. Together they bought pumpkins from a roadside stand, four as usual. Both texted Naomi daily, knowing that behind the cold mask there was a heart as damaged as theirs. After some time, Naomi softened and agreed to come home for Thanksgiving."],["p","In their own minds it was not stoicism that sustained them but defeatism. At the end of the workday, when one of them felt paralyzed—they fell into that state by turns—the other would insist that they drive to a park in a nearby town.

about the deceased was nothing like travelling down memory lane. Memory lane, Jiayu said to herself, what an odd phrase. Only an organized mind could have come up with it. Remembering was not like walking along a tree-lined path with wooden posts marking the years. Memory was a haystack. Search for any one story and you’d get a hundred stories, none of them complete."],["p","And the stories kept coming. They were distractions from thinking about Evan, even though distraction was unattainable, and thinking about Evan was the wrong way to put it. Thinking, like remembering, was an action of retrospect. But Evan was here all the time: in the new, elaborate recipes she tried on weekends, in the vases of flowers she placed around the house to combat bleakness, in the hollow voice of the guided-meditations app that brought her little reprieve from heartache."],["p","She left the spreadsheet open on her computer. Each name was more than just a story of a death. Take Sister Wen’s husband, for instance. Sister Wen, the youngest daughter of the family who’d lived next to Jiayu’s in Beijing, was fourteen years older than Jiayu. When Sister Wen started dating a police officer, every Sunday morning Jiayu would wait for him at the entrance of the alley. The moment he arrived on his motorcycle, she would run back. It didn’t matter that Sister Wen was already standing in the yard, listening for the engine. Jiayu wanted to be the one to shout, He’s here, he’s here, he’s here, as though she were a magpie, bringing the early good tidings of the marriage."],["p","Fifty, liver cancer. When Jiayu typed this next to the man’s name, she could not see him as an older man. Once, he and Sister Wen had taken Jiayu for a ride. Jiayu had climbed into the sidecar, clutching the metal bar in front of her and looking up at Sister Wen and her boyfriend: she in an apricot-colored dress, he in a white uniform. “When we were happy we had other names”: Jiayu remembered reading the line as a student, though she could not recall the context now. A young couple in love and a child wanting nothing more than to witness that love story—what were they all now? A dead man, a widow, and a mother who had lost a child."],["p","But Jiayu was not the first parent to lose a child. Of this she constantly reminded herself. There was her cousin Min, whose baby had died of leukemia before she turned two. The baby had faded from Jiayu’s memory, though she knew that if she opened an old album she would find a picture of her. After she died, many relatives had shed tears, but how many of them could tell a story about that little girl now? Min had another child later, a healthy boy. An aunt who treasured sons more than daughters had said to Jiayu’s mother once that the whole thing could be seen in a positive light, since the baby’s death had made room for the little brother. Sometimes a daughter is just bad news, the aunt had said, and the one-child policy certainly doesn’t help."],["p","And there was Yingying, Jiayu’s playmate before the pair had moved to different elementary schools. Their mothers taught together at the Beijing No. 2 School for the Deaf and the Mute, and the girls would play together in the schoolyard in the afternoon as they waited for their mothers to get off from work. A year younger than Jiayu, Yingying was a timid girl, and Jiayu liked to tease her with a caterpillar hidden in a matchbox or a beetle let loose on the back of her hand. Yingying would cry, and Jiayu would comfort her, and then they would reconcile, all the while pretending that they did not notice the students around them, most of whom were boarders supported by the government. They were much older, some in their late teens, ready to leave school after an apprenticeship."],["p","Jiayu wondered now if they had both been performing a little, she seeking any excuse to make Yingying cry, and Yingying welcoming every opportunity to make loud noises that would differentiate the two of them from the students. Some of them stood in a half circle around Jiayu and Yingying, staring unsmilingly at the two girls and then gesturing among themselves. It thrilled Jiayu to know that they were talking about her and her friend. There was no other way for her and Yingying to enter that silent world than by being at the center of the half circle, speaking to each other without having to move a finger."],["p","A year ago, Jiayu’s mother had called to report the death of Yingying. Ovarian cancer, forty-three, her daughter just starting middle school. Jiayu could not see her childhood playmate as a woman in a coffin, a mother’s lost child, a child’s lost mother. But what difference did seeing make? Perhaps grief was nothing but disbelief."]],["inline-embed",{"type":"section","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22section%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cp%3EThe%20first%20snow%20fell%20and%20melted.%20And%20the%20second%20snow.%20After%20that%2C%20there%20was%20no%20reason%20to%20keep%20counting.%20The%20neighbors%20put%20up%20Christmas%20lights%2C%20blue%20and%20white%20icicles%20under%20the%20eaves%2C%20orange%20and%20red%20bulbs%20outlining%20the%20evergreens%2C%20a%20deer%20pulling%20a%20sleigh%20in%20one%20front%20yard%2C%20wide-winged%20angels%20trumpeting%20in%20another.%20The%20world%20was%20not%20new%20and%20offered%20little%20evidence%20that%20it%20would%20ever%20be%20new%20again.%20Perhaps%20grief%20was%20the%20recognition%20of%20having%20run%20out%20of%20illusions.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EWould%20decorating%20the%20house%20make%20us%20too%20sad%3F%20Jiayu%20asked%20one%20evening%20as%20they%20parked%20in%20front%20of%20their%20unlit%20house.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EWould%20we%20be%20sadder%20if%20we%20didn%E2%80%99t%3F%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EWhat%20do%20you%20think%20Evan%20would%E2%80%99ve%20wanted%20us%20to%20do%3F%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EI%20don%E2%80%99t%20know.%20I%20can%20talk%20myself%20into%20either%20option.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3ESame%20here.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22callout%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522callout%2522%252C%2522name%2522%253A%2522inset-left%2522%252C%2522body%2522%253A%2522%253Cinline-embed%2520type%253D%255C%2522cartoon%255C%2522%2520meta%253D%255C%2522%25257B%252522type%252522%25253A%252522cartoon%252522%25252C%252522url%252522%25253A%252522%25252Fcartoon%25252F5ba3ed20f9deee71afe9e2cc%252522%25252C%252522width%252522%25253A%252522%252522%25252C%252522height%252522%25253A%252522%252522%25252C%252522caption%252522%25253A%252522%252522%25257D%255C%2522%2520ref%253D%255C%25225ba3ed20f9deee71afe9e2cc%255C%2522%253E%253C%252Finline-embed%253E%2522%252C%2522attrs%2522%253A%257B%257D%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%22%5C%22%3E%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22cartoon%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522cartoon%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%2522%252Fcartoon%252F5ba3ed20f9deee71afe9e2cc%2522%252C%2522width%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522height%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522caption%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%225ba3ed20f9deee71afe9e2cc%5C%22%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%3Cp%3EWhat%20about%20the%20Christmas%20tree%3F%20What%20about%20the%20four%20stockings%20Jiayu%20had%20embroidered%20with%20their%20names%3F%20What%20about%20going%20to%20Mrs.%20Erickson%E2%80%99s%20house%20on%20Christmas%20Eve%3F%20Mrs.%20Erickson%E2%80%99s%20granddaughter%20and%20Evan%20had%20been%20born%20a%20day%20apart%2C%20and%20had%2C%20for%20different%20reasons%2C%20stayed%20in%20the%20%3Cem%20class%3D%5C%22small%5C%22%3ENICU%3C%2Fem%3E%20in%20adjacent%20rooms.%20After%20that%2C%20Mrs.%20Erickson%20had%20turned%20Evan%20into%20another%20grandchild%20of%20hers%2C%20and%20for%20fifteen%20Christmases%20they%20had%20joined%20Mrs.%20Erickson%20and%20her%20extended%20family%2C%20feasting%20on%20baked%20ham%2C%20scalloped%20potatoes%2C%20and%20krumkake.%20Afterward%20they%20sang%20Christmas%20carols%2C%20accompanied%20by%20Mrs.%20Erickson%20on%20an%20old%20upright%20piano%2C%20which%20was%20tuned%20once%20a%20year%20for%20the%20occasion.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EEvery%20question%20asked%20led%20to%20a%20dead%20end.%20Jiayu%20figured%20that%20one%20of%20these%20days%20she%20and%20Chris%20would%20look%20at%20each%20other%20and%2C%20without%20hesitation%2C%20drive%20to%20the%20lot%20to%20pick%20out%20a%20tree.%20Chris%20would%20put%20up%20the%20lights%20and%20Jiayu%20would%20arrange%20the%20stockings%2C%20including%20Evan%E2%80%99s%2C%20on%20the%20mantel.%20When%20the%20invitation%20came%20from%20Mrs.%20Erickson%2C%20they%20would%20ask%20if%20they%20could%20bring%20pot%20stickers%2C%20their%20usual%20contribution.%20They%20would%20do%20everything%20as%20they%20had%20always%20done%20it.%20%E2%80%9CAlways%E2%80%9D%20was%20an%20untrustworthy%20word.%20Still%2C%20what%20could%20one%20do%20but%20abide%20by%20the%20rule%20of%20%E2%80%9Calways%E2%80%9D%3F%20In%20a%20fallible%20life%2C%20it%20was%20a%20path%20no%20better%20or%20worse%20than%20any%20other.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%22%7D","ref":""},["p","The first snow fell and melted.

spreadsheet stopped growing. The ache remained unmitigated. A person’s knowledge of death could be exhaustible, yet it did nothing to exhaust the pain of losing a child. If Jiayu were to start a spreadsheet of people who were alive and healthy and happy, perhaps she would end up with a much longer list, but if many deaths could not produce an effective antidote to one death, what difference would many lives make?"],["p","It occurred to Jiayu that someday Evan might appear on another person’s list. The thought neither consoled nor disturbed her. On the spreadsheet there was Hua, a high-school classmate who had committed suicide the year before they graduated. There was the father of Jiayu’s preschool friend, who had killed himself two years ago, one evening after he finished rehearsing with the retirees’ choir. Jiayu had never once spoken to Hua in high school. Her friend’s father wore dark-framed glasses, but that was all she could remember."],["p","Still, she returned to the spreadsheet often, trying to recall one more moment, one more detail. Sometimes a new name occurred to Jiayu, amazing her, as though the dead were patiently waiting for her to recover them. An old woman known as Granny Brave, who had lived alone in the next alleyway, was said to have been a peasant partisan during the Second World War. After her death, this was confirmed by the newspapers, which also printed a picture of the Brave Girl—her nickname during the war—when she was a teen-ager, her hair chopped short, a carbine on her shoulder, and two unsheathed daggers haphazardly tucked into her belt. In third grade, Jiayu and her best friend had schemed to win a yearlong contest that consisted of doing good deeds, and they decided that they would visit Granny Brave every day, cleaning her house, running errands for her, preparing simple meals, and listening to her reminisce about her legendary war years. She waved them away the first two times they came, and when they persevered she chased them out with a broom. If they dared to show up again, she admonished, she would report them to the school as harassers of a veteran revolutionary. Oh, such humiliation, such injustice, Jiayu thought now, feeling, for the first time in a long while, the urge to laugh. She remembered that, the day after Granny Brave’s threat, she and her friend had dug up ten earthworms and hurled them into the old woman’s yard."],["p","Oh, what fun to relive the years of the young and the undefeated."],["p","Or to retrace the lives of the old and the accomplished. Of all the people on her list, Jiayu was most often drawn back to her grandfather. He had lived a long and happy life and had died at the age of a hundred and one. He had been a good husband to his wife, a loving father to his eight children, affectionate and fair to all his grandchildren. He had not cried when Min’s little girl died but had given each of his great-grandchildren born after that a silver longevity lock—a pendant with “A Hundred Years of Long Life” engraved on one side and “Wealthy, Lucky, Safe, and Peaceful” on the other—to secure their fragile existence."],["p","In his old age, after the death of his wife, he had spent part of his time living with each of his children and part travelling alone, sometimes stopping by the homes of those grandchildren who had established families of their own. Because Jiayu’s mother was the youngest of the siblings, her family often received her grandfather in August. Never did the visit extend beyond a few weeks. He did not allow himself to become a nuisance to anyone."],["p","Her grandfather’s life alone would make a good memory lane, Jiayu thought. His stay had usually overlapped with her summer holiday, and she had been his companion on his morning jogs, evening strolls, and many outings to the palaces and the parks of Beijing."],["p","She could, while sitting in front of the computer, walk down memory lane in the Summer Palace or the Forbidden City, as long as she followed the never-changing routes: from a round pavilion to an octagonal pavilion, from an arched stone bridge to an arched wooden bridge, from a koi pond with lily pads to a koi pond without lily pads. On the hottest days, they had remained at home, sitting in the shade of the scholar tree in the yard, her grandfather pouring tea for himself from a tin pot kept cool in a basin of water, Jiayu hunting for inchworms among the low-hanging branches. The transistor radio he had given her they kept at low volume, but when they tired of readjusting the dial they left it to broadcast static. Sometimes her grandfather dozed off. Only then would Jiayu pick out one of the coins he’d given her and go buy an ice pop."],["p","Every summer before her grandfather’s arrival, her mother would talk to herself as she readied his room. Each visit is one visit fewer in this life, she said. At his age, you never know if there will be a next time. After years of teaching at the school for the deaf and the mute, she had developed a habit of speaking her thoughts aloud, forgetting that the world could hear what she said."],["p","Jiayu heard everything. A more sensitive child might have worried herself sleepless or watched her grandfather’s every movement with anxiety. But nothing about him had indicated ill health. After a day or two, it was hard not to believe that he was going to live forever."],["p","All things had seemed in order under that scholar tree. Jiayu was an ordinary child, easily contented; her grandfather, a man with a well-lived life. Life was supposed to be like that, each generation reaching a gracious end when it was their turn.

two more deaths showed up for her list one day, a mother and a daughter, neither name known to her. This so startled Jiayu that she thought her heart, already brittle, could no longer remain a steady organ inside her. For days afterward, she lived in a trance, fearing the inaccuracies of memory, excavating the archeology of her childhood, the fragments like small pieces of bone, delicate and dusty."],["p","It was on one of their evening walks that Jiayu and her grandfather had met the woman and her two daughters, the older one Jiayu’s age, the younger one still in a bamboo stroller. That there had been two girls Jiayu was certain. And that there had been a bamboo stroller. She and the other girl took turns pushing it around while Jiayu’s grandfather and the girls’ mother sat on a bench nearby. Jiayu had turned five earlier that spring, and she carried the transistor radio with her everywhere. The girl who was to be her playmate for a few weeks asked to see the radio, and Jiayu showed her the on-and-off switch, the dials for changing the frequency and the volume, and the collapsible antenna, which they pulled out and pretended was a fishing pole. The girl in the stroller, who, in their play, was the fish to be caught, held her hands up and cried, but they kept the end of the antenna just out of her reach. All these things Jiayu remembered now. The pot-lid haircuts of both sisters she could see. And her own favorite dress, a yellow sleeveless smock with sunflowers embroidered around the hem."],["p","Then the younger girl disappeared, along with the stroller. It happened that same summer, but Jiayu could not remember exactly when. One day, she and the older sister climbed up onto a rock next to a man-made lake, where the girl said that her sister had died but didn’t say how. Without the little sister to be the fish, Jiayu and the girl did not have a game to play that day. They stayed on the rock listening to the radio, Jiayu remembered, taking care not to drop the radio from that height, and watching the girl’s mother and Jiayu’s grandfather on the bench. Was the woman telling him the news with tears, or with dry eyes? Was he, despite maintaining the proper distance between an older man and a young mother, imagining her hands in his?"],["p","And soon came the storm in the house. It was the only time Jiayu had seen her mother lose her temper with her grandfather. Impossible, she had called him. Crazy, she had called the woman. What would people think, she had yelled, a man of his age and a woman young enough to be his granddaughter?"],["p","It could not have been only financial support that he had wanted to give the woman, Jiayu thought now, as he could have given her money without letting anyone know. Was it a marriage, or a less conventional arrangement, he was proposing? Had he envisioned altering his widower’s life out of pity for a widow and mother who had lost too much, or out of affection for a woman who had brightened a summer as his life approached its curtain call, or, perhaps, out of a loneliness that his many children and grandchildren could not entirely alleviate? Jiayu did not dare to answer any of these questions. An answer was unnecessary when a question asked was enough to give the past another name."],["p","The summer after that had been eventless, as were those that followed. As always, Jiayu and her grandfather walked the city, but they did not run into the woman and her remaining daughter again. A few years later, the girl transferred to Jiayu’s school. Jiayu recognized her right away, but the girl didn’t seem to remember Jiayu. The story was that the girl’s mother had died, and the girl now lived with an uncle and an aunt, the latter a distant cousin of her mother’s. The couple had given her a new name, which Jiayu now remembered—memory could be tightfisted with the past and then, without warning, open the floodgate. Shuchang, the girl was called, a name with two characters, meaning “happy and carefree.” The couple who had adopted the girl must have had some hope for her. Jiayu realized that she had not known and would never know the girl’s old name, when she had been her mother’s daughter."],["p","Jiayu’s grandfather had died when she was in college. Only then did she learn that he had had a wife before her grandmother. That wife had killed herself when their only son died, as an infant, of diphtheria. This knowledge, learned too late, had been boxed up by Jiayu as distant—ancient—history, and she had not imagined that family of three until now. If life was an antechamber to death, death was an antechamber, too—to other lives. She thought about the rock by the man-made lake, from which she and the girl had watched the man and the woman on the bench. It had taken her child’s death for Jiayu to mourn her grandfather again, this time as the young man who had buried his wife and child. She would not say it was late, though. True grief, beginning with disbelief and often ending elsewhere, was never too late. ♦"]]],"canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"sections":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"},"slug":"magazine","children":[{"id":"5907efd0019dfc3494e9c92f","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5907efd0019dfc3494e9c92f","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Fiction","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"fiction"},{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"},{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"}],"name":"Fiction","parent":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"},"slug":"fiction"}]}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"magazine","contentTags":[{"name":";","url":"/tag/"}],"contentType":"article","contributors":[{"name":"Yiyun

a recent evening at Mayanoki, an eight-seat sushi bar in Alphabet City, the chef, Jeff Miller, introduced a course of his omakase as “Newburgh shrimp.” You’d be forgiven for wondering if it shared something in common with lobster Newburg, a dish first served at Delmonico’s in the late eighteen-hundreds. But that old classic, which features an immoderate sauce of butter, cream, egg yolk, cognac, and cayenne pepper, is, according to legend, named for one of its inventors, while Newburgh shrimp is so called because of the provenance of the crustaceans themselves: Newburgh, New York, a small city in the Hudson Valley. “Shrimp live in the Hudson River?” you may be asking yourself in amazement. They do not (at least not the kind you’d want to eat), but shrimp do live near the Hudson, in saltwater tanks in the basement of a former mattress factory, farmed by a Brazilian-born man named Jean Claude Frajmund, who sells them at the Union Square Greenmarket."],["inline-embed",{"type":"callout","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22callout%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22feature-small%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22image%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522image%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%2522%252Fphotos%252F5ba4058dc3a03e5deeb880d1%2522%252C%2522width%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522height%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522caption%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%225ba4058dc3a03e5deeb880d1%5C%22%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%22%2C%22attrs%22%3A%7B%7D%7D","ref":""},["inline-embed",{"type":"image","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22image%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22%2Fphotos%2F5ba4058dc3a03e5deeb880d1%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":"5ba4058dc3a03e5deeb880d1"}]],["p","Even more surprising is that Newburgh shrimp are delicious. Miller cures them in salt and sugar, torches them until they curl up, then fits each around a mound of rice seasoned with vinegar made from aged sake solids. Still translucent, they retain a bit of crunch and a satisfying sweetness that plays perfect foil to a glossy swipe of funky shrimp-head oil and a wispy tangle of fried shallots. Like everything on the menu here, they’re served because they’re sustainable, procured in a way that does the least possible harm to the species, to the environment, and to the seafood industry. In the hands of Miller, who possesses both a strikingly inventive palate and a gift for storytelling, this mission seems not remotely sanctimonious, only thrilling; after eating a tender rhombus of lionfish from Florida, I found myself poring excitedly over a pamphlet he’d handed me about the urgent need to consume the monstrous-looking species, which has invaded waters around that state."],["inline-embed",{"type":"callout","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22callout%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22feature-small%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22image%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522image%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%2522%252Fphotos%252F5ba4058e33eb496e0686c8a8%2522%252C%2522width%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522height%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522caption%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%225ba4058e33eb496e0686c8a8%5C%22%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%22%2C%22attrs%22%3A%7B%7D%7D","ref":""},["inline-embed",{"type":"image","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22image%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22%2Fphotos%2F5ba4058e33eb496e0686c8a8%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":"5ba4058e33eb496e0686c8a8"}]],["p","Sushi snobs and sustainability sticklers may find things to gripe about. Miller is not Japanese—he’s white, from inland California. He’s been to Japan, but he trained mostly in Texas (under the tutelage of Japanese chefs). You won’t find bluefin tuna or uni imported from Hokkaido; you will, however, find Dungeness crab flown in from Oregon and that lionfish from Florida, far enough to leave a carbon footprint. (New York’s other notably sustainable sushi restaurant, the recently opened Okozushi, serves only local fish.) But I defy anyone to argue with rich, silky black sea bass from Rhode Island, dotted with lime zest; thick, slick Montauk scallops glazed with Meyer lemon; or steelhead trout, from another farm in the Hudson Valley, lightly applewood-smoked. A strip of silver skin left on a piece of sweet, mellow bluefish belly from Point Pleasant, New Jersey, glistened as seductively as gold leaf in the romantic lighting. A luxury ingredient grows in the Garden State.

She pauses before adding, “And I got plans for it.” It can be startling to hear a woman of color describe and claim her own body: despite advances in our culture, some eyes still roll when a black woman says “I” or puts herself forward; in this political climate, it can be perceived as an aggressive act or as hysteria or—the worst—as special pleading. This has been an on-again, off-again problem in American letters since the nineteen-seventies, when authors ranging from ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2003/10/27/ghosts-in-the-house"},"Toni Morrison"]," to Lucille Clifton, Gayle Jones, and Ntozake Shange began to write from inside black women’s lives, from a landscape that was dominated not by visible or invisible men but by black female characters, living intricately and boldly in their times, in their minds, and in their bodies, and pursuing joyful and complicated sexual lives. This was no small achievement, as the poet and activist Audre Lorde argued in her 1978 essay “Uses of the Erotic: The Erotic as Power”: “In order to perpetuate itself, every oppression must corrupt or distort those various sources of power within the culture of the oppressed that can provide energy for change. For women, this has meant a suppression of the erotic as a considered source of power and information within our lives.”"],["p","Forty years later, it is still a bold move for black women to take on the erotic in writing. Consider, for instance, these lines from Robin Coste Lewis’s incredible poem “Plantation,” in her 2015 collection, “",["a",{"href":"https://www.amazon.com/Voyage-Sable-Venus-Other-Poems/dp/1101875437"},"Voyage of the Sable Venus and Other Poems"],",” addressed to another woman of color: “Then your tongue / was inside my mouth, and I wanted to say // ",["em","Please ask me first"],", but it was your / tongue, so who cared suddenly // about your poor manners?” For Lewis and others, including Tracy K. Smith, the current United States Poet Laureate, writing about desire is a way of being heard in a world where it’s still necessary to say, as the woman on “Random Acts of Flyness” had to, “I only got one body. And I got plans for it.”"],["p","In Smith’s four books of verse—her latest, “",["a",{"href":"https://www.amazon.com/Wade-Water-Tracy-K-Smith/dp/1555978134"},"Wade in the Water"],"” (Graywolf), came out in April, and was recently followed by an anthology, “American Journal: Fifty Poems for Our Time” (co-published by Graywolf and the Library of Congress)—love and sexuality take many forms. The poem “Serenade,” in Smith’s witty and authoritative first book, “The Body’s Question” (2003), opens with a scene of happy erotic abduction:"],["blockquote",["p","I am dancing with Luis,",["br"],"The dancing ",["em","puto,"],["br"],"Delirious with Spanish and moonlight,",["br"],"With the scrawl of streets that led us here",["br"],"To night in a foreign language.",["br"],"We are dancing the ",["em","merengue"],["br"],"And my body rings",["br"],"With the ringing that wants to be answered.",["br"],"As though I am a little drunk in the bones."]],["p","In the next stanza, Smith zooms out to show us the place that holds her lust, like a delectable treat, in its hand. She’s in a “City of Restless Vendors, of Steep Embankments,” where her foreignness is no doubt part of what makes her feel so free. Soon, though, she shifts her focus back to Luis. Dancing with him makes manifest the question of the body—its capacity to feel joy, its capacity to give joy:"],["blockquote",["p","Luis takes my hand in his hand",["br"],"And draws circles in the air",["br"],"Above my head. I am spinning.",["br"],"Sloppily at first, until my mind",["br"],"Begins to understand that grace",["br"],"Is a different phenomenon here,",["br"],"And lets go of my two legs,",["br"],"Allowing them to dance on their own"]],["p","“Serenade” evokes a passage in Ntozake Shange’s 1975 “choreopoem,” “",["a",{"href":"https://www.amazon.com/Colored-Girls-Considered-Suicide-Rainbow/dp/0684843269"},"For colored girls who have considered suicide / When the rainbow is enuf"],",” where a “lady in blue” describes sweaty nights full of desire, dancing the “mambo, bomba, merengue” to Willie Colón:"],["blockquote",["p","so off i made it to this 36 hour marathon dance",["br"],"con salsa con ricardo",["br"],"“suggggggggggar” ray on southern blvd . . .",["br"],"wit my colored new jersey self",["br"],"didn’t know what anybody waz saying",["br"],"cept if dancin waz proof of origin",["br"],["em",{"class":"indent4"},"i was jibarita herself that nite"],["br"],"&amp; the next day",["br"],"i kept smilin &amp; right on steppin",["br"],"if he cd lead i waz ready to dance"]],["p","Smith has some of Shange’s theatrical force, though she is quieter in her effects; they both shimmer, but Smith has less flash. Her tone, conversational but never arch, invites us in. She’s a storyteller who loves to explore how the body can respond to a lover, to family, to history. In her second book, “",["a",{"href":"https://www.amazon.com/Duende-Poems-Tracy-K-Smith/dp/1555974759"},"Duende"],"” (2007), the Smith who danced freely within the sphere of place and history is undone by the real and metaphysical responsibilities of the erotic life she has chosen.

But the moment passes as Smith, no longer the girl carried off by Luis, does the taking. But what is it that she has taken? What needs to be rooted out? That all-consuming, lunatic desire that ages us even as it drives us wild?"],["p","In “Duende” and in her third book, the Pulitzer Prize-winning “",["a",{"href":"https://www.amazon.com/Life-Mars-Tracy-K-Smith/dp/1555975844"},"Life on Mars"],"” (2011), Smith explores another aspect of her “I”—Tracy before she was Tracy. In “Interrogative,” she writes of her pregnant mother: “What did your hand mean to smooth / Across the casket of your belly? / What echoed there, if not me—tiny body / Afloat, akimbo, awake, or at rest?” To imagine who you were before you were is a way of understanding who you are now and what you may become. Smith is interested in the roots of love, the various selves that go into the making of a body. But “Duende” isn’t all wish and wonder. It’s also about threats to the female body, pleasures that can be withdrawn, judged. In her extraordinary poem “The Searchers,” she writes about a character in John Ford’s 1956 film of the same title—a white girl who was kidnapped and brought up by Native Americans. Saved, in a manner of speaking, by John Wayne, the child is returned to the white world she has never known:"],["blockquote",["p","He wants to kill her for surviving,",["br"],"For the language she spits,",["br"],"The way she runs, clutching",["br"],"Her skirt as if life pools there."],["p","Instead he grabs her, puts her",["br"],"On his saddle, rides back",["br"],"Into town where faces",["br"],"She barely remembers"],["p","Smile into her fear",["br"],"With questions and the wish,",["br"],"The impossible wish, to forget.",["br"],"What does living do to any of us?"]],["p","Again and again, the questions arise: What does it mean for a man to take a girl or a woman? And what can it do to a man’s idea of a woman if she is free and takes him? Is a relationship a kind of abduction or a form of rescue? Are men agents of freedom or of oppression?

of the gorgeous struggle in Smith’s poetry is about how to understand and accept her twin selves: the black girl who was brought up to be a polite Christian and the woman who is willing to give herself over to unbridled sensation and desire, even with guys of other races."],["p","Born in 1972, Smith was the youngest of five siblings. Her parents, Floyd and Kathryn, an engineer and a schoolteacher, respectively, were Alabama natives who came up, politically speaking, during the civil-rights era. Smith was born in Massachusetts, but the family soon moved to Fairfield, California, where Floyd was stationed at a military base. Smith was a relatively privileged child; some of her siblings were already away at college when she was learning to read and write, so she had her parents more or less to herself. Words were a bond between the couple and their child. In her remarkable memoir, “",["a",{"href":"https://www.amazon.com/Ordinary-Light-Tracy-K-Smith/dp/0345804074"},"Ordinary Light"],"” (2015), Smith describes the bookshelves that her father had built in the hallway leading to her parents’ bedroom. There she found “the books my father would forever push me to read: ‘Kidnapped,’ ‘Gulliver’s Travels,’ ‘Ivanhoe,’ and the ones I eventually came to discover on my own. . . . There were some of [my mother’s] books on the shelves, I’m sure of it, books on child-rearing and theology, but the majority of what sat there spoke to my father’s sense of the world—or the world as he’d like us to know it: a vast and varied place full of mystery and order.”"],["p","For Kathryn Smith, mystery and order were ecclesiastical; the world began and ended with His word. It wasn’t that she was fierce in her belief so much as that she was calmly, resolutely resigned to the power of faith. Floyd was happily resigned to the power of science and earthly life. (At one point, he set up an incubator in the house, so that Tracy could see how birds were hatched.)"],["p","If there is a central underlying tension in “Ordinary Light,” it’s the division between Smith’s reflective, mother-identified self—the one who, at age three, told her mother that she wanted to open her heart to the Lord—and the energy that goes into actively living one’s life, as exemplified by her father. Should Smith be independent, like a boy, or was it her portion, as a girl, to wait for Jesus to take the wheel? Were girls like her meant to be the upholders of community—Christian community—while boys were free to be individual thinkers? And where was Jesus when, for instance, a girl Tracy knew asked her if she wished she were white? Smith writes:"],["blockquote",["p","I don’t think we ever truly forgot about whites, even when we were alone among ourselves in the thick of family. I doubt any blacks do. There’s always a place in the mind that feels different, distinct; not worse off or envious but simply aware of an extra thing that living in a world that loathes and fears us has necessitated we develop. Perhaps that thing is the counterbalance to the history of loss I often tried to block out with silence: a riotous upswing that, quickly, painlessly, allows the mind to unravel from all the knowing and wondering it has been taught to do; a simple tickle of recognition capable of catching us up in a feeling—no matter how very fleeting—of historical joy."]],["p","The Smith of “Ordinary Light” is our Emerson, the Emerson of “Self-Reliance,” say, especially when she is examining a woman’s habit of making do in order to make something great. Emerson noted, “In every work of genius we recognize our own rejected thoughts: they come back to us with a certain alienated majesty.” In Smith’s world, ",["em","possibility"]," is the key. Unlike some black writers, she doesn’t address the double rejection of blackness—by society and by the fractured family—not just because she didn’t experience the latter but because she’s more interested in black excellence and achievement that aren’t tainted by class aspirations, all that upwardly mobile Jack and Jill society jazz. The Smith kids made it because of who they were, not who they knew. Their parents taught them, by example, to be aspirational. Love and self-love, especially for blacks, are not a given but aspirational, too."],["p","At Harvard, where Smith studied English, she began to write in earnest, inspired by what she heard in her head, of course, but also by the work of several poets she would consider essential to her growth. Emily Dickinson’s outrageous freedom when it came to drawing on Biblical cadences and forming her own colloquialisms may have been Smith’s greatest influence. She also fell in love with a boy, with whom she experienced physical pleasure. When Smith went home the following summer, at her mother’s church she heard a woman praying out loud for her and her boyfriend. In a passage of agonizing beauty, she notes how far she felt she’d travelled from the religion that had infused her girlhood:"],["blockquote",["p","Left behind by the homily and miles away from the other churchgoers, whose minds, at least from where I sat, appeared to be actively trailing the minister’s words, hearing them and chuckling or murmuring, or merely nodding to themselves as the meaning sunk in, I realized I had no idea what the story was that I was part of. I didn’t yet know what was important to me or what would remain important years down the line, after the thrill of experiencing these first freedoms, and the weight of living with what they brought, had passed."]],["p","After Smith’s mother died, of cancer, in 1994—characteristically, she felt that her disease was part of God’s grace, His plan for her—her father began seeing another woman, and Smith confronted him about it. How dare death and time erode the world her parents made for her? Had she herself left it behind when she decided to inhabit her own mind and body? Had she left her parents behind? If so, the abandonment was momentary, just as death is. (It’s grief that’s long.) In the end, Smith embodied her father’s science through precision and observation, and her mother’s faith by surviving with grace. In “The Speed of Belief,” from “Life on Mars,” she tells the story of love, her parents’ love, as something that outlasts death—at least in a child’s imagination. After her father died, she writes:"],["blockquote",["p","Probably he spun out of himself",["br"],"And landed squarely in that there, his new",["br"],"Body capable, lean, vibrating at the speed",["br"],"Of belief.

There was to be a football game, a family bowling day, and a Saturday-night party, with door prizes and music by DJ Miliano, “playing everything from the 90s and a little bit from today.” The Wilmington Convention Center, where the festivities were meant to take place, sits on the northeast bank of the Cape Fear River, which crested at sixty-two feet after ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/news/dispatch/hurricane-florence-hits-eastern-north-carolina-the-cesspool-of-the-united-states"},"Hurricane Florence"],".

When she was done, she drove to Raleigh, where her mother greeted her with a supper of biscuits, molasses, fatback, and smoked sausages. More than two thousand of her colleagues—some with kids in tow—stayed at the hospital for six days, caring for patients."],["p","Andrew Cooke, our class president, still lives in Wilmington, but his girlfriend, Mary Jane Weeks, persuaded him to evacuate to Elizabeth City. In Chapel Hill, Meredith Fitch was celebrating her wedding anniversary—she noted that the date, thirteen years ago, was nearly rained out by Hurricane Ophelia. From the pulpit of Covenant Christian Church, in Cary, the Reverend Chris Furr preached about compassion. That Sunday, his congregation put nineteen hundred dollars in the collection plate. His mother and father—New Hanover High’s former principal, Dewey N. (Chris) Furr—had evacuated to his house.

window at the back of this sleek bar frames a contraption that looks like one of the onion domes atop St. Basil’s Cathedral, in Moscow, but fashioned out of copper. The device is not, as a patron recently suggested, the latest in Russian espionage technology but, rather, a pot still, where a corn-based alcoholic mash is heated before the liquid is siphoned off and cooled. The resulting product is Our Vodka, a slightly fruity, remarkably clean-tasting version of the spirit. “It’s the first legal distillery in Manhattan since Prohibition,” an employee explained as she showed a clutch of bar crawlers around the facility. Our has a handful of distilleries in other cities, including Berlin, London, and Detroit, each of which sources its own local ingredients. “Manhattan was definitely the most complicated location in which to get all the permits,” the employee said. Behind the counter at the front, bottles of the vodka are sold, and a friendly bartender mixes cocktails for an after-office crowd, groups of colleagues who get progressively more vivacious throughout the evening without shedding their backpacks. “Don’t tell my friends from high school—back then, it was all about not conforming,” a lady in a white tube dress murmured to a co-worker. “Now I work at an insurance company.” The bartender smiled and poured an Excelsior ’64, which sparkled with elderflower and lemon. “It’s our take on a French 75,” he said. “But we use vodka and a New York State pét-nat sparkling wine.” The test of any vodka is how it fares in a Martini: Our’s, which comes with a few shakes of orange bitters and a dash of sherry, is smooth and dangerously drinkable. After a few sips, the woman in the tube dress confessed, “Well, I tried to not pay taxes for a while, but that’s about as far as I got.” ",["em","(151 W. 26th St.

Escovedo, the singer and songwriter, likes to have a proper Mexican breakfast before a long drive. “Let’s go here,” he said. He pulled into the back lot of a restaurant called El Pueblo, across from the Tornado bus terminal on East Jefferson Boulevard, in the Oak Cliff section of Dallas. El Pueblo, he said, is where travellers arriving by bus from Mexico often go to eat and to get their bearings. He ordered in Spanish, then remarked that his Spanish was poor. The plates came quickly. ",["em","Chorizo con huevos"],". “This is bad",["em","ass"],", man,” he said. An elderly vagrant looked in through the window and then walked in. Escovedo gave him a dollar. “When I was small, I used to be able to see the pain in people,” he said."],["p","This was the Friday before Labor Day. The following week, he was due in Philadelphia, to begin a tour that would take him to Brooklyn, then south, and west, and eventually back to Dallas. Typically, he’d be resting up, but that night he had a benefit gig in Austin, his former home town, and so, prior to leaving Texas, he was sneaking in a three-day road trip, a kind of sentimental journey—south to Austin and beyond, backward through time, down to the border of old Mexico. He had rented a black S.U.V., with room for a guitar and an amp; he joked that its tinted windows and low clearance gave it a slight cartel vibe—good for Laredo."],["p","Escovedo, who is sixty-seven, was about to release a new album, his fourteenth as a solo artist, on top of a few with a run of beloved but luckless punk-ish bands. For this one, he’d teamed up with an Italian musician and former journalist named Antonio Gramentieri, known to all as Don Antonio. The album, “The Crossing,” tells an imagined story of two young immigrants working in an Italian restaurant in Texas: a Mexican named Diego (a kid not unlike Escovedo) and an Italian named Salvo (a version of Gramentieri), who share a love of punk rock, as well as the hardships and wonders of their experience as less than welcome newcomers to America. They recorded it in Italy, with a band comprising Gramentieri’s childhood friends and neighbors in Modigliana, a small ",["em","comune"]," east of Bologna—a long way from the ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/04/23/a-voyage-along-trumps-wall"},"Rio Grande"],". The album has the customary Escovedo mixture of romping Stooges guitar and plaintive folk, but also, in places, a cinematic heft that suggests Ennio Morricone—a whiff of the spaghetti Southwestern. Escovedo and Gramentieri didn’t have ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump"},"Trump"],", or his wall, or ",["em",{"class":"small"},"ICE"]," square in their sights when they started, but the tragedy of the lives disrupted on both sides of the southern border suffuses the album; the context deepens an idiosyncratic cycle of songs. As Escovedo sings at the end, “We all become history when we make the crossing.”"],["p","Four years ago, Escovedo got married for the third time, to a hair stylist and photographer named Nancy Rankin; a year later, they moved to Dallas from Austin, where he’d lived since 1980, and where he’d made a name for himself. Alejandro splitting Austin? It was as if Joey Ramone had moved to Boston. Rankin had a job on a television show in Dallas, and they were looking for a clean break. But, also, Austin had got too gentrified, too popular, too expensive. “It’s overrun with this hipster thing,” he said. “I’m told it gets a thousand new people a week. I blame myself for going around the world telling people how great Austin is.” The bumper-sticker invocation “Keep Austin Weird” had apparently come up short."],["p","Now Escovedo was an evangelist for the weirdness of Dallas. He and Rankin rent an apartment above the reception desk in the Belmont Hotel, a former stucco motor lodge reborn as a kind of bohemian citadel, with a view of downtown. He often performs in the lounge there, and hosts talks with writers and musicians. Their apartment is cluttered with books and records, the spare bedroom a studio of sorts, filled with old guitars. There are makeshift shrines to ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/11/11/lou-reed"},"Lou Reed"],", ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/postscript-david-bowie-1947-2016"},"David Bowie"],", and Juan Marichal, Escovedo’s favorite baseball player as a kid, and to his seven children—six girls and a boy, ranging in age from fifteen to forty-eight."],["p","After breakfast, Escovedo drove down Jefferson Boulevard, admiring the pawnshops and the ",["em","quinceañera"]," storefronts, and the Texas Theatre, where Lee Harvey Oswald was cornered after the assassination up the road. Escovedo had on a straw hat, a burgundy T-shirt, stovepipe Levi’s, running shoes, and, around his neck, a caramel-colored bandanna, held with a silver clasp. He has an overbite and big cheeks, which add an affable and perhaps misdirecting ingenuousness to his presence, in person and onstage.

night in 2003, Escovedo was preparing to go onstage, in an auditorium in Tempe, Arizona, when he succumbed to a wave of what felt like a bad flu. He vomited blood—three bowls of it, he said—and felt better. After the gig, he collapsed backstage and was rushed to the emergency room. In the hospital, a nurse asked him, “What are you in here for?”"],["p","“Hepatitis C,” Escovedo said."],["p","She said, “You’re going to die if you don’t get a liver transplant.”"],["p","He’d received the diagnosis five years before, when he was forty-seven. How he’d caught hep C he didn’t know, but there had been some intravenous drug use, in the late seventies, when he was a punk rocker living in the Chelsea Hotel and the East Village. Since the diagnosis, he’d had some good months and some bad ones, but now, with advanced cirrhosis and a bleeding esophagus, it seemed as though there might not be any more months at all. In the hospital, he again started throwing up blood. A nurse said to his sister, who was at his bedside, “If we don’t do something soon, we’re going to lose him.” And then he passed out. He soon found himself in a space without walls, in a void of light, where he was visited by his children. They wore brightly colored serapes and headdresses festooned with little balls, and they were laughing and singing and playing tambourines and flutes, and grabbing onto his legs. He thought, There is nothing here but love."],["p","When he came to, hours later, he learned that he’d received a blood transfusion. He had no health insurance, and so in the months ahead an array of friends and collaborators in the music world performed benefit concerts on his behalf. Eventually, many of these friends—among them, ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2000/06/05/delta-nights"},"Lucinda Williams"],", Ian Hunter, ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/01/30/john-cales-inventive-retrospection"},"John Cale"],"—recorded a double album of covers of his songs, called “Por Vida.” Some artists had to be turned away, for lack of space. As musicians age and encounter health problems, they are constantly playing fund-raisers for one another, but Escovedo inspired an almost custodial regard among other musicians, those both more famous than he and less. A cynic might guess that he’d had enough success to touch all of them but not so much as to foster jealousy or resentment. Or maybe there was nothing there but love: here was a sensitive, agile songwriter who could rock out with the blunt force of Johnny Thunders—both a literate soul and a true punk, a humble collaborator and a plucky front man, a pussycat and a tomcat. The attention earned him a new generation of fans, including me; the support—financial and otherwise—got him through. He found a way to manage the hepatitis for the next dozen years, and got back to recording and performing."],["p","Escovedo and Rankin, who is forty-six, met in 2013, at the Continental Club, a popular honky-tonk on South Congress, in Austin. Escovedo was performing. Throughout the set, he seemed to be singing just to her, she felt. Later, he introduced himself, and a courtship commenced. For their honeymoon, in 2014, Escovedo took her to one of his favorite places, El Pescadero, near the tip of Baja California, where an old surfing friend had a villa on the beach. On the seventh day, a Category 4 hurricane named Odile made landfall and ravaged the coast, while they huddled, terrified, in the villa. Escovedo cursed himself for having brought Rankin there. When the eye passed over, hours later, they ventured outside to survey the damage, only to see—or really just hear, because it was dark, and the power had gone out—a flood roaring down an arroyo that ran past the property.

On a few occasions, he fell into a kind of psychedelic gibberish, exhibited uncharacteristic petulance, and pulled weird stunts—pouring salt in friends’ coffee, running through the apartment naked—which he barely remembered afterward. To him, it felt as though he were high on PCP; to Rankin, he seemed to be reverting to a seven-year-old version of himself. Was this the hepatitis? A stroke?"],["p","Before the second show of the tour, as the band prepared to take the stage, he had a panic attack and couldn’t go on. This had never happened to him. He had always been a game and spirited performer, whether in front of a couple of dozen people or seventy-five thousand. Rankin took him to the emergency room, but tests revealed nothing. Concerned for his health, the band cancelled the tour, and Escovedo entered a period of debt and gloom. Doctors, after Rankin eventually mentioned the hurricane, allowed that he might be suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. They recommended rest. He was dropped by his manager—Bruce Springsteen’s man, Jon Landau. “They were tired of me, tired of my records not selling,” Escovedo told me. “I hung up the phone and said, ‘Baby, we’re really on our own now.’ ” (Landau wrote, in an e-mail, “We tried everything we knew how to do. It remains an injustice that such a great guy and great talent has not become more widely known and appreciated for the superb artist we know him to be.”)"],["p","Convalescence kicked in. A course of drugs got rid of the hepatitis. As for the P.T.S.D., the treatment, in the end, was getting out of Austin and getting back together with Buck and McCaughey. With another guitarist, Kurt Bloch, they recorded an album, “Burn Something Beautiful,” in 2016, and they went out on the road. I caught them one January night at the City Winery, in downtown Manhattan, where patrons sit at tables and eat dinner while the musicians perform. The three guitarists, Buck, Bloch and Escovedo, none of them young, whipped up a fury that made a mockery of the dinner-theatre conceit. Alejandro was

long way to Austin took us through the towns of Hico, Hamilton, and Lampasas and into the rolling oak-and-limestone hill country of central Texas. In yards and driveways, there seemed to be more signs for the Senate candidate Beto O’Rourke than for Ted Cruz. “Beto’s a punk!” Escovedo said, with admiration."],["p","Texas was where he was born, and where he made his bones, but he’d grown up in California. He dialled up his younger sister Dolly, his closest sibling, to compare memories of their parents. Dolly was driving, too, en route from Southern California to Reno. “Dolly, in your opinion—do you know the real reason we left Texas?”"],["p","“Honest?”"],["p","“Honest.”"],["p","Escovedo has twelve siblings and half siblings. The father of all thirteen children had been a mariachi musician and a prizefighter in his youth but worked mainly as a plumber. Known as Don Pedro, or Buck to his bar friends, he was a rake, a pool shark, a horseman, a snappy dresser, and a suave singer and dancer. “My father was basically a rock-and-roll star,” Escovedo said. Don Pedro was born in 1907 in Saltillo, the capital of the state of Coahuila, Mexico. His parents left him there while they went to find work picking cotton and making cedar posts in Texas, but when he was twelve he followed them across, riding the rails with an older cousin. “There was no line in those days,” Escovedo said. “There was the river. It was almost like the same country.” The boys tracked down the parents in Luling, Texas. Escovedo’s grandfather was a hard-drinking watermelon picker who regularly beat his sons. Escovedo wrote the song “Wave” about the children:"],["blockquote",["p","Don’t you cry",["br"],"I made it to the other side",["br"],"The sun’s not brighter here",["br"],"It only shines on golden hair."]],["p","Escovedo’s mother, Cleotilda Renteria, was from San Marcos, Texas, one of twelve children. Her father sold drygoods and, Escovedo was told, he was the first Mexican shop owner on the town square. “He got burned out twice,” Escovedo said. “Then he got killed by a car while walking along the side of the road.” Cleotilda’s mother raised the twelve kids. Later, she lived with the family, and was, in Escovedo’s memory, a “scary, scary figure, dressed always in black with a veil. She never spoke English. She always said I was too dark. My skin.”"],["p","Escovedo, born in San Antonio in 1951, was Cleo’s first child with Don Pedro. They lived in an old Mexican neighborhood on the west side of town. They spoke Spanish. The father caroused, the mother simmered, and there came a day when she decided to leave him. “My mother was going to make her escape,” Escovedo said. “She had hired a man to drive us to California.” Don Pedro, who’d been at large for weeks, found out, came home, gathered up the family, and announced that he was taking them on a vacation. They drove to Orange County, California, leaving everything behind, including Alejandro’s dog. The vacation soon revealed itself to be a relocation. His abiding last memory of Texas, before he returned a couple of decades later, was of a dead cow in the road, beset by vultures."],["p","California was a paradise of orange groves and avocado orchards. Soon after arriving, the family went in their church clothes to see the ocean. “We weren’t allowed even to take off our shoes on the beach,” Escovedo said. “It must’ve looked like some Chicano Fellini movie.” Eventually, they settled in Huntington Beach. He surfed, boxed, played baseball, and hung around the record store. “I learned English from rock and roll,” he said."],["p","Escovedo dropped out of high school and left home at sixteen. “It wasn’t that it wasn’t a loving family,” he said. “But you can’t find one photo of my mother holding me. She was hard to live with. Of my siblings, I’m the most like my father, and as a result I reminded her of him.”"],["p","By the time Escovedo was eighteen, he had a wife and a kid. He was hanging around with James Luna, who went on to become a renowned Mexican-American and Native American performance artist, and developing a sense of discernment and taste. Although Escovedo came from a family of musicians, he wasn’t much interested in making music himself. His older half brothers Pete and Coke were Latin jazz musicians who also played with Santana and other bands. Sheila E., best known for her work with Prince, is Pete’s daughter. Not long ago, Pete was recording an album and put out word that he wanted to have as many Escovedos as possible perform on it. Several dozen showed up. At one point, they tried to choreograph a dance routine. Alejandro said, “They told me, ‘We want to see your birth certificate to make sure you’re an Escovedo. Because you can’t move for shit.’ ”"],["p","In 1975, after separating from his wife and moving to San Francisco, he and a friend were making a film loosely based on ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/where-punk-rock-begins"},"Iggy Pop"]," and the Stooges; they needed to shoot a band. He picked up a guitar and pretended to play, and before long this bit of flimflam mutated into the formation of the Nuns, a foundational Bay Area glam-punk outfit. Eventually, the Nuns made it to New York, and Escovedo was besotted by the scene. The Nuns hung out at Max’s Kansas City, and Escovedo wound up at a table with ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/andy-warhol"},"Andy Warhol"],", ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/07/09/how-george-clinton-made-funk-a-world-view"},"George Clinton"],", and the members of Blondie. He decided to stay, taking a room at the Chelsea Hotel. He was in residence when Sid Vicious was charged with stabbing Nancy Spungen. A few years later, as a member of another group, Rank and File, the pioneers of so-called cowpunk, he returned to Texas, and fell in love with Austin, then a laid-back but decadent hub of songwriters who were crossbreeding country, blues, rock, punk, and folk, producing new subgenres (including what’s now called alt-country) that are practically mainstream. He left Rank and File and, with his brother Javier, started the True Believers, a raunchy three-guitar group that was briefly the hottest band in Austin. “We were basking in the sense that something big was about to happen to us,” Escovedo said. “But we fell short.”"]],["inline-embed",{"type":"section","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22section%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cp%3EOur%20first%20stop%20in%20Austin%20was%20Rock%20n%20Roll%20Rentals%2C%20a%20vast%20warehouse%20of%20gear%2C%20to%20pay%20for%20the%20sound%20equipment%20that%20Escovedo%E2%80%99s%20band%20would%20be%20taking%20on%20tour.%20%E2%80%9CI%E2%80%99ve%20been%20coming%20here%20since%20it%20was%20a%20little%20house%2C%E2%80%9D%20he%20said.%20Everyone%20seemed%20to%20know%20him.%20A%20guy%20spooling%20cable%20said%2C%20%E2%80%9CThey%20been%20playing%20the%20shit%20out%20of%20you%20on%20satellite%20radio.%E2%80%9D%20Escovedo%20handed%20over%20his%20credit%20card%2C%20and%20the%20guy%20at%20the%20register%20said%2C%20%E2%80%9CSorry%2C%20I%20know%20it%E2%80%99s%20a%20pain%2C%20but%20everyone%20has%20to%20do%20it.%20Even%20Robert%20Plant.%E2%80%9D%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EThe%20gig%20that%20night%2C%20at%20the%20Continental%2C%20was%20a%20benefit%20for%20a%20longtime%20Austin%20fanzine%20editor%20who%20needed%20a%20new%2C%20souped-up%20wheelchair.%20The%20organizers%20were%20hoping%20to%20raise%20thirty%20thousand%20dollars%2C%20and%20Escovedo%20was%20at%20the%20top%20of%20the%20bill.%20He%20reunited%20with%20Rankin%2C%20who%E2%80%99d%20come%20to%20Austin%20a%20couple%20of%20days%20earlier%20for%20appointments%20with%20old%20clients.%20She%20has%20long%20blond%20hair%20and%20bangs%20and%20glasses%20and%20wore%20a%20shirt%20dress%20with%20horizontal%20black%20and%20white%20stripes.%20In%20the%20hotel%20lobby%2C%20Escovedo%20realized%20he%E2%80%99d%20forgotten%20his%20guitar%20upstairs%2C%20and%20Rankin%20demonstrated%20no%20irritation%20whatsoever%20when%20he%20went%20back%20to%20fetch%20it.%20On%20the%20road%2C%20she%20works%20the%20merchandise%20table%2C%20takes%20photos%2C%20and%20makes%20sure%20Escovedo%20is%20taking%20care%20of%20himself%3A%20juices%2C%20beets%2C%20water%2C%20sleep.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EThe%20Continental%20is%20in%20some%20respects%20Escovedo%E2%80%99s%20home%20court.%20The%20crowd%20was%20mostly%20seasoned%20Austinites%2C%20older%20but%20exuberant%20in%20reunion.%20Escovedo%20hauled%20his%20guitar%20and%20amp%20in%20from%20the%20car.%20Avid%20greetings%20ensued%2C%20among%20local%20eminences%20and%20barflies.%20Escovedo%20was%20joined%20that%20night%20by%20Rosie%20Flores%2C%20a%20hot-shot%20local%20guitarist%20whose%20garlanded%20burgundy%20wide-brimmed%20hat%20brought%20to%20mind%20a%20shredder%20Minnie%20Pearl.%20The%20drummer%20was%20his%20longtime%20collaborator%20Hector%20Mu%C3%B1oz%2C%20whom%20he%20called%20%E2%80%9Cthe%20Benicio%20del%20Toro%20of%20Austin.%E2%80%9D%20They%20opened%20with%20%E2%80%9CSally%20Was%20a%20Cop%E2%80%9D%20(%E2%80%9Cbut%20now%20she%E2%80%99s%20a%20soldier%E2%80%9D)%20and%20then%20went%20into%20%E2%80%9CAlways%20a%20Friend%2C%E2%80%9D%20perhaps%20Escovedo%E2%80%99s%20best-known%20song%2C%20in%20part%20because%20Bruce%20Springsteen%20used%20to%20play%20it.%20Clara%20the%20bartender%20climbed%20atop%20a%20speaker%20case%20and%20began%20go-go%20dancing%2C%20which%20seemed%20to%20send%20a%20current%20through%20Escovedo.%20He%20has%20an%20infectious%20way%20of%20spurring%20his%20band%2C%20barking%20%E2%80%9CCome%20on!%E2%80%9D%20and%20%E2%80%9CLet%E2%80%99s%20go!%E2%80%9D%20with%20a%20barrage%20of%20guitar%20chords.%20Suddenly%2C%20what%20had%20seemed%20a%20local%20favorite%E2%80%99s%20perfectly%20nice%20presentation%20of%20well-made%20songs%20to%20a%20friendly%2C%20graying%20audience%20became%20a%20raucous%2C%20sweaty%20rock%20show.%20Escovedo%2C%20who%E2%80%99d%20appeared%20wistful%20and%20weary%20toward%20the%20end%20of%20the%20drive%2C%20seemed%20to%20shed%20decades.%20By%20the%20time%20he%20wrapped%20up%20with%20one%20of%20his%20go-to%20bangers%2C%20%E2%80%9CCastanets%2C%E2%80%9D%20a%20New%20York%20Dolls%20kind%20of%20thing%20with%20the%20cheeky%20chorus%20%E2%80%9CI%20like%20her%20better%20when%20she%20walks%20away%E2%80%9D%20(for%20a%20while%2C%20he%E2%80%99d%20stopped%20playing%20it%2C%20after%20he%20learned%20that%20George%C2%A0W.%20Bush%20had%20it%20on%20his%20iPod)%2C%20an%20anonymous%20donor%20had%20given%20twenty-five%20thousand%20dollars%20to%20the%20wheelchair%20cause%E2%80%94mission%20accomplished.%20Behind%20the%20club%2C%20the%20musicians%20and%20some%20friends%20hung%20out%20and%20drank%20and%20smoked%20things%2C%20until%20Escovedo%2C%20looking%20drained%2C%20his%20eyes%20a%20little%20rheumy%2C%20carried%20his%20guitar%20and%20amp%20out%20to%20the%20car.%20He%20and%20Rankin%20went%20to%20get%20some%20midnight%20tacos.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EIn%20the%20morning%2C%20Escovedo%20showed%20me%20around%20town.%20He%20is%20a%20prolific%20if%20understated%20storyteller%2C%20and%20Austin%20was%20a%20thicket%20of%20prompts.%20Here%20was%20the%20site%20of%20the%20old%20Alamo%20Hotel%2C%20where%20he%20sang%20in%20public%20for%20the%20first%20time%3A%20%E2%80%9CBlue%20Yodel%20No.%209.%E2%80%9D%20There%20was%20the%20office%20building%20that%20had%20replaced%20Las%20Manitas

first stop in Austin was Rock n Roll Rentals, a vast warehouse of gear, to pay for the sound equipment that Escovedo’s band would be taking on tour. “I’ve been coming here since it was a little house,” he said. Everyone seemed to know him. A guy spooling cable said, “They been playing the shit out of you on satellite radio.” Escovedo handed over his credit card, and the guy at the register said, “Sorry, I know it’s a pain, but everyone has to do it. Even Robert Plant.”"],["p","The gig that night, at the Continental, was a benefit for a longtime Austin fanzine editor who needed a new, souped-up wheelchair. The organizers were hoping to raise thirty thousand dollars, and Escovedo was at the top of the bill. He reunited with Rankin, who’d come to Austin a couple of days earlier for appointments with old clients. She has long blond hair and bangs and glasses and wore a shirt dress with horizontal black and white stripes. In the hotel lobby, Escovedo realized he’d forgotten his guitar upstairs, and Rankin demonstrated no irritation whatsoever when he went back to fetch it. On the road, she works the merchandise table, takes photos, and makes sure Escovedo is taking care of himself: juices, beets, water, sleep."],["p","The Continental is in some respects Escovedo’s home court. The crowd was mostly seasoned Austinites, older but exuberant in reunion. Escovedo hauled his guitar and amp in from the car. Avid greetings ensued, among local eminences and barflies. Escovedo was joined that night by Rosie Flores, a hot-shot local guitarist whose garlanded burgundy wide-brimmed hat brought to mind a shredder Minnie Pearl. The drummer was his longtime collaborator Hector Muñoz, whom he called “the Benicio del Toro of Austin.” They opened with “Sally Was a Cop” (“but now she’s a soldier”) and then went into “Always a Friend,” perhaps Escovedo’s best-known song, in part because Bruce Springsteen used to play it. Clara the bartender climbed atop a speaker case and began go-go dancing, which seemed to send a current through Escovedo. He has an infectious way of spurring his band, barking “Come on!” and “Let’s go!” with a barrage of guitar chords. Suddenly, what had seemed a local favorite’s perfectly nice presentation of well-made songs to a friendly, graying audience became a raucous, sweaty rock show. Escovedo, who’d appeared wistful and weary toward the end of the drive, seemed to shed decades. By the time he wrapped up with one of his go-to bangers, “Castanets,” a New York Dolls kind of thing with the cheeky chorus “I like her better when she walks away” (for a while, he’d stopped playing it, after he learned that George W. Bush had it on his iPod), an anonymous donor had given twenty-five thousand dollars to the wheelchair cause—mission accomplished. Behind the club, the musicians and some friends hung out and drank and smoked things, until Escovedo, looking drained, his eyes a little rheumy, carried his guitar and amp out to the car. He and Rankin went to get some midnight tacos."],["p","In the morning, Escovedo showed me around town. He is a prolific if understated storyteller, and Austin was a thicket of prompts. Here was the site of the old Alamo Hotel, where he sang in public for the first time: “Blue Yodel No. 9.” There was the office building that had replaced Las Manitas, the old restaurant and gathering place, where Jonathan Demme had once planned to shoot scenes for a documentary about Escovedo. He pointed out a vast construction pit, which used to be a rambling apartment complex owned by Willie Nelson. “It was a madhouse full of pot dealers.” On a side street, we passed a grinning gent in a cowboy hat, and Escovedo said, “He used to do my gardening.” At the corner of Oxford and Valeria, he pointed to a modest white clapboard house. “This is where my kids grew up. Bobbi got this house.”"],["p","Bobbi Levie was his second partner, his guide and right hand as he came of age in San Francisco, New York, and Austin, who, shortly after the birth of their second daughter, in 1991, took her own life."],["p","“Bobbi was in a lot of pain,” he said. “She was a lovely, beautiful, well-read, sharp, street-smart woman. But there came a time when we went our separate ways.” Escovedo was with her and the girls at the house the day she died; she said she was going to get cigarettes and never came back. “That began the whole process of trying to crawl out of a hole of guilt,” he went on. “You don’t ever rid yourself of the effects of that. And Austin was a small town. I took a lot of blame. I lost friends over it.”"],["p","Escovedo’s first two solo albums, “Gravity” and especially “Thirteen Years,” took a lot of this up. They were a departure from his work with the True Believers, much deeper, lyrically, with string accompaniment—Iggy Pop by way of Van Morrison, maybe. He went from being a guy in cool bands to being taken seriously as a songwriter, in a songwriters’ town."],["p","“Bobbi didn’t like my being a musician,” Escovedo said. “In her eyes, I was supposed to be a writer. When I started playing guitar in the Nuns, she was not impressed at all. She didn’t like my songwriting, either. Her guy was Lou Reed. Later, she said, ‘Why are you wasting your time? It’s never going to amount to anything.’ I took great offense to that.” Escovedo is generally fed up with being asked about low sales and small halls.

The dashboard monitor read “Don Antonio.” “The first time I went to the Continental Club was in 1996,” an Italian-accented voice said. “I was a teen-ager with a big dream.”"],["p","Gramentieri grew up (and still lives) in Modigliana, and has long been a fanatic of American blues, especially the Texas style. He estimates that he has been to Texas at least fifty times. But, as exacting as he was in his imitations, he could never get his guitar to sound right. “I was playing the same note and wondering why it is so different,” he said. He had a revelation, brought on by Ry Cooder’s collaboration with the Cuban guitarist Manuel Galbán, that there was a way to bring his own particular cultural influence to his interpretation of American music. His region’s traditional folk music, usually featuring an accordion and a violin, had a great deal in common with old Tejano music. He found particular inspiration in Mexican-American rock music: “Los Lobos was my Beatles. Alejandro was the Latino Clash.”"],["p","A few years ago, Gramentieri formed a band with his childhood friends and neighbors, called, naturally enough, Don Antonio, and recorded an album in Sicily, “which to me is the Texas of Italy.” Gramentieri sent the finished recording to his booking agent, in London, who happened to be Escovedo’s new manager, and whom Escovedo, that week, had asked about finding musicians in Europe for him to perform with on a tour overseas. The manager connected them. “It was supposed to be a one-off,” Gramentieri said. “But right away, our first rehearsal, something clicked. Maybe there was a shared Latino perspective on all these sounds.”"],["p","On the road in Europe, Gramentieri and Escovedo decided to write and record together. Gramentieri came to Texas for a couple of three-week visits, and he and Escovedo went around Dallas, interviewing Mexican immigrants about their experiences and reconsidering their own. Then Escovedo, with Rankin, moved to Italy for a few months and got down to work with the Don Antonio band in Modigliana. Initially, Escovedo had hired the band to save money, but now he was so keen on the collaboration that he was paying nine thousand dollars on work visas to bring them to America—for this month’s tour and a longer one starting in January, where they will perform “The Crossing” in full."],["p","“Alejandro has this aura,” Gramentieri said. “He has a strong charismatic and spiritual presence. His face is like a Mayan mask, without a specific space and time. He can set the energy of a room without trying too hard.

rolled into San Antonio and stopped for a bite to eat in the King William district, the seat of the old gentry, which had gone to seed and then been regentrified. He wanted to catch up with John Phillip Santos, a writer and fellow San Antonio native who was collaborating with him on a memoir. Santos was a font of Tejano history; he referred to San Antonio as “a secret Mexican city, the northernmost edge of New Spain, the margin of empire.” Forget, for a second, the Alamo. The city, and the state, was part of Mexico, when Stephen Austin arrived, in the eighteen-twenties, with his roughly three hundred Anglo families: migrants of another stripe. The Rio Grande was not yet a border, or a place to build a wall."],["p","Escovedo ordered but didn’t finish a beer—he tends to have just a taste. We’d planned to see his boyhood home, on the west side, but then he wondered aloud if there might be some minor-league baseball to catch in Laredo. Escovedo pitched in Little League and always brings a ball and two gloves on tour. Los Tecolotes de los Dos Laredos, a ball club in the Mexican League that splits its home games between Laredo, on the American side, and Nuevo Laredo, on the Mexican side, had a game, at Uni-Trade Stadium, on Sinatra Parkway. We arrived in time for the two anthems. Outside the chain-link fence between the lot and the field, Escovedo removed his hat and stood still for “The Star-Spangled Banner,” and then, as the Mexican anthem played, we bought, for eight dollars apiece, a pair of third-row seats behind the plate. The Tecos’ uniforms were trimmed in the green and red of the Mexican flag. The visiting team was from Monclova, in Coahuila. The public-address announcements were all in Spanish. By the second inning, the stands had almost filled up, amid the cicada rattle of ratcheted noisemakers known as ",["em","matracas"],", and the call-and-response taunts of fans along the first- and third-base lines. Above the visiting dugout, a man in an ape suit made lewd gestures and led chants of “asshole” and “",["em","puto"],",” in an unfolding feud across the field with a chubby ",["em","güey"]," in a giant sombrero. Between innings, an owl mascot did the merengue. Escovedo, in big square sunglasses and a new Tecos cap, sipped a Tecate and declared that this was the best time he’d had in ages."],["p","In our time together, Escovedo told me a slew of stories of being treated badly, or at least differently, because he was Mexican-American. He recalled a program director telling his record company, “We already have a Mexican band, no room for another.” (This was a reference to Los Lobos.) “We can’t even pronounce his name. How do you expect us to play him?” He has his share of driving-while-Mexican stories, and after we’d passed, on the northbound side of I-35, between San Antonio and Laredo, an elaborate Border Patrol checkpoint, he began to worry about driving back the next night. He called Rankin and had her send copies of his birth certificate, marriage license, and passport. It was infuriating, though perhaps no longer surprising, to contemplate that a son of Texas, one of the state’s most celebrated artists, had to fret about travelling along its highways. There’d been news, that week, of the Border Patrol detaining a Texas man with a passport on his return from Mexico, and of new passports being denied to some people who were native-born. Escovedo recalled a time that he and Bobbi Levie had taken a train from Austin to Mexico City. After disembarking at the border in Laredo to switch trains, police officers wouldn’t let him back on. “They said I was an Indian.”"],["p","That night, I walked the streets of Laredo alone. The commercial district was all but dead, except for police and Border Patrol vehicles, and a few rough-looking bars. In the morning, when I told Escovedo I’d gone out, he said, “It’s sketchy here, dude. Look at how desolate this place is.” We were driving to get some ",["em","huevos"]," and ",["em","barbacoa"],". A hearty Mexican breakfast. “Now I’m really worried about going through that checkpoint,” he said."],["p","Escovedo had got up early to go for a run before the heat took hold. He’d always been lean, but he’d recently developed a small paunch, another by-product, he said, of the hurricane: “Cortisol collects itself in the midriff.” Even at 8 ",["em",{"class":"small"},"a"],".",["em",{"class":"small"},"m"],"., the sun was oppressive; by noon, the temperature would be a hundred and five degrees. He set off in a park along the Rio Grande. For a while, a Border Patrol officer followed him in an S.U.V. He saw an officer watching him from a rise. There were others on boats. On the Mexican bank, some men waded in the river with fishing nets. He ran past the bridge where his mother and grandmother had been caught, decades ago, trying to smuggle Mexican plants under their dresses for their garden in San Antonio—“which is silly,” he said, “because the plants are the same on both sides.”"],["p","As he ran, he listened on his earphones to his new album—not because he usually listens to his own music but because he had to learn the songs, so that he could begin performing them, later that week, when he joined Don Antonio and his band in Philadelphia. It dawned on him, as he jogged along the Rio, what “The Crossing” was really about. The song playing was “Texas Is My Mother,” which was partly informed by a conversation he and Don Antonio had had with a Dreamer in a Dallas restaurant who’d lugged his aunt across the Rio Grande. The chorus is: “I would carry you on my shoulders, across the muddy river / Texas feels like Mexico. It reminds me of my mother.” Escovedo began to think about how Mexican culture had always been a part of him, and how it had never fully accepted him. The experience of crossing through life, from one identity to another, was a lot like that of crossing a river or an ocean—another kind of migration and disruption. Self-assertion and self-obliteration."],["p","He was stopped along the path by a lean, gray-stubbled Mexican-looking man. The man said that he was a marathoner. “Where are you running?” he asked, and described some trails away from the river, in the brush above the banks. Escovedo wasn’t sure what to make of this and turned around and jogged back to the hotel. Once there, he changed his plans. Laredo gave him the creeps, he missed his wife, and he wanted no part of that checkpoint on I-35.

She was dismissed by contemporaries as a gold-digger, but, as this thoroughly researched biography shows, she emerged as a wise ruler who helped reinvigorate Mughal culture. Instrumental in significant policy and military decisions—she once rode an elephant into battle to rescue her husband—she was also a talented amateur architect, designing a marble tomb that inspired the Taj Mahal. Although no later Mughal woman attained Nur’s standing, Lal shows that her reign had a lasting effect on female empowerment, enabling royal wives to issue an array of orders beyond the harem."],["inline-embed",{"type":"callout","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22callout%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22feature-small%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22callout%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522callout%2522%252C%2522name%2522%253A%2522inset-left%2522%252C%2522body%2522%253A%2522%253Cinline-embed%2520type%253D%255C%2522image%255C%2522%2520meta%253D%255C%2522%25257B%252522type%252522%25253A%252522image%252522%25252C%252522url%252522%25253A%252522%25252Fphotos%25252F5ba3d8f6e4238c2fdd7abbdd%252522%25252C%252522width%252522%25253A%252522%252522%25252C%252522height%252522%25253A%252522%252522%25252C%252522caption%252522%25253A%252522%252522%25257D%255C%2522%2520ref%253D%255C%25225ba3d8f6e4238c2fdd7abbdd%255C%2522%253E%253C%252Finline-embed%253E%2522%252C%2522attrs%2522%253A%257B%257D%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%22%5C%22%3E%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22image%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522image%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%2522%252Fphotos%252F5ba3d8f6e4238c2fdd7abbdd%2522%252C%2522width%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522height%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522caption%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%225ba3d8f6e4238c2fdd7abbdd%5C%22%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%22%2C%22attrs%22%3A%7B%7D%7D","ref":""},["inline-embed",{"type":"callout","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22callout%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22inset-left%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22image%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522image%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%2522%252Fphotos%252F5ba3d8f6e4238c2fdd7abbdd%2522%252C%2522width%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522height%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522caption%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%225ba3d8f6e4238c2fdd7abbdd%5C%22%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%22%2C%22attrs%22%3A%7B%7D%7D","ref":""},["inline-embed",{"type":"image","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22image%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22%2Fphotos%2F5ba3d8f6e4238c2fdd7abbdd%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":"5ba3d8f6e4238c2fdd7abbdd"}]]],["p",["strong",["a",{"href":"https://www.amazon.com/Walls-History-Civilization-Blood-Brick/dp/1501172700/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1537802553&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Walls+frye"},"Walls"]],["em",", by David Frye (Scribner)"],". This lively history argues that there is a “nearly universal correlation between civilization and walls.” Frye examines such societies as the Persians, the Athenians, and the Romans, all of whom constructed barriers to protect against invaders, creating secure zones where citizens were freed from military duties to pursue art, culture, and commerce. “Without walls,” Frye writes, there would have been no “Chinese scholars, Babylonian mathematicians, or Greek philosophers.” In the twentieth century, modern weaponry rendered walls ineffective for defense, and structures such as the Berlin Wall represented a “clash of symbols,” separating ideologies rather than armies. Frye concludes that today, with some seventy border walls worldwide, we are entering the “second age of walls.”"],["inline-embed",{"type":"callout","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22callout%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22feature-small%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22callout%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522callout%2522%252C%2522name%2522%253A%2522inset-left%2522%252C%2522body%2522%253A%2522%253Cinline-embed%2520type%253D%255C%2522image%255C%2522%2520meta%253D%255C%2522%25257B%252522type%252522%25253A%252522image%252522%25252C%252522url%252522%25253A%252522%25252Fphotos%25252F5ba3d8f65e40f46c9f9c5674%252522%25252C%252522width%252522%25253A%252522%252522%25252C%252522height%252522%25253A%252522%252522%25252C%252522caption%252522%25253A%252522%252522%25257D%255C%2522%2520ref%253D%255C%25225ba3d8f65e40f46c9f9c5674%255C%2522%253E%253C%252Finline-embed%253E%2522%252C%2522attrs%2522%253A%257B%257D%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%22%5C%22%3E%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22image%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522image%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%2522%252Fphotos%252F5ba3d8f65e40f46c9f9c5674%2522%252C%2522width%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522height%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522caption%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%225ba3d8f65e40f46c9f9c5674%5C%22%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%22%2C%22attrs%22%3A%7B%7D%7D","ref":""},["inline-embed",{"type":"callout","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22callout%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22inset-left%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22image%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522image%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%2522%252Fphotos%252F5ba3d8f65e40f46c9f9c5674%2522%252C%2522width%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522height%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522caption%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%225ba3d8f65e40f46c9f9c5674%5C%22%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%22%2C%22attrs%22%3A%7B%7D%7D","ref":""},["inline-embed",{"type":"image","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22image%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22%2Fphotos%2F5ba3d8f65e40f46c9f9c5674%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":"5ba3d8f65e40f46c9f9c5674"}]]],["p",["strong",["a",{"href":"https://www.amazon.com/Eden-Andrea-Kleine/dp/1328884082/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1537802573&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=eden+kleine"},"Eden"]],["em",", by Andrea Kleine (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt)"],".

Two half sisters, Eden and Hope, are abducted, after their father forgets to pick them up, and tortured, in harrowing scenes narrated by Hope, who is then fourteen. Decades later, after her mother dies, Hope, haunted by romantic and professional setbacks, finds letters addressed to the girls informing them that the kidnapper is up for parole. She sets out on a road trip to find Eden, who disappeared not long after the abduction, and, perhaps, a new approach to life as a survivor.

Roxana, the American teen-age narrator of this début bildungsroman, spends a summer abroad in a small Jutland town with a brooding Dane she has met named Søren. As sexual and ideological rifts curdle their romantic attraction, she is drawn into another, purer entanglement, with a sensitive refugee from the Balkans. Though the narrative strays into Scandinavian travelogue and the lovers are prone to indulgent poetics, Locascio captures, frankly but lyrically, the heroine’s intense hunger to master her own body and the new world around her.

H. Barry, the Tony Award-winning fight director, rode an electric scooter down West End Avenue to Lincoln Center, where he was choreographing stage combat for Giacomo Puccini’s “",["a",{"href":"https://www.amazon.com/Puccini-Fanciulla-West-Eleanor-Steber/dp/B00UVMYP4E"},"La Fanciulla del West"],",” which opens next week at the Metropolitan Opera. In a basement studio, which was set up like a Wild West saloon, he took a seat near a wooden table strewn with playing cards, fake pistols, and prop whiskey bottles. An Italian tenor, a Serbian baritone, an American basso cantante, and some twenty extras milled around, preparing for the big Act I brawl. “It’s a comic fight,” Barry explained. “It’s like an Irish bar, and every Friday night these people beat the crap out of each other.” He added, in an exaggerated brogue, “ ‘Aye, ye broke the strings of me harp!’ ”"],["p","Someone cried “Curtain!” and the actors started pretend-fighting. Barry, who is seventy-eight, with a Clark Gable mustache and a bouncy tuft of silver hair, furrowed his brow, noting that a couple of men drew their firearms before they were meant to. His principal concern, though, was that the scene’s most stirring moment, in which an actor leaps from a balcony, occurs too early in the sequence. “Rudolf Nureyev”—the late Soviet ballet dancer—“taught me never to open all your Christmas presents at once,” Barry said, adopting a Russian accent. “ ‘You open a little present, then bullshit-bullshit-bullshit, then a bigger present, bullshit-bullshit-bullshit, and then you open the ",["em","big"]," present.’ ”"],["p","Barry approached the jumper, a bald man wearing cargo shorts. “Frank is seventy years old!” he said, cheerfully."],["p","“I’m not seventy,” the actor, Frank Colardo, snapped."],["p","“I thought you said you were seventy. What are you?”"],["p","“Sixty-seven.”"],["p","“Frank, always lie ",["em","up"],",” Barry instructed. “I tell people I’m ninety, and they go, ‘You look good for ninety!’ ”"],["p","He approached another actor, a man with a linebacker’s build who’d been throwing a fake punch. “Josh, don’t”—Barry jerked his head violently, demonstrating what not to do. “It’s the hand that fulfills the objective, rather than the head. The head says it, then the hand takes over. Word, then action.”"],["p","“Word, then action,” the actor repeated."],["p","During a union-mandated break, Barry went to the staff cafeteria in search of a latte. He found a coffee machine and took a seat next to a synthetic plant. “Steinbeck says that fighting is a symptom of man’s failure as a thinking animal,” he said, in between sips. “With the right pressure, we go from an amicable situation straight into the craziness.” He recalled a recent dispute with a neighbor. “He went ballistic. That emotion!” Barry continued, “Everything I learn about the human condition enables me onstage.”"],["p","Barry, who is British, started his career as an actor and director. He has no formal training in opera. “I learned opera by being in opera,” he said. One of his main artistic inspirations is aikido, in which he has a black belt. “It’s all about manipulation,” he said. “If I stop a punch, then it goes nowhere, but if I turn it into something else it has a whole series of manifestations.”"],["p","Back in the rehearsal space, Barry gave pointers as the actors trickled in. He’d observed that one of the principals, Michael Todd Simpson, was being insufficiently menacing with his gun. “Move your hand forward,” Barry instructed. “Feel the difference? You’re indicating that you’re ",["em","angry"],".” He helped Colardo find his spirit animal (a rabbit). “You’re the peacemaker who sets everything in motion,” Barry told him. “Just as I was figuring,” Colardo said. “I’m like the rabbit that runs around and just causes trouble.”"],["p","Barry gave the cast a pep talk. “A buddy of mine is a big barroom brawler,” he began. “I asked him, ‘Don, what do you get out of this?’ He said, ‘Ah, it’s really a wonderful feeling of letting go. The worst part is getting hit for the first time. After that, it doesn’t hurt anymore. You’re running on adrenaline. ’ It’s the same here.” He told the actors, “",["em","Never"]," keep your feet still.”"],["p","The men practiced the scene more than a dozen times, perspiring and grunting as Barry narrated from the sideline: “Crash! Boom! Smash! Good!” The flying chairs, punches to the gut, and kicks to the groin took on a kind of beauty. “What I’m doing is a reference to every Western I’ve ever seen,” Barry said. “I’ve stolen from everybody.”"],["p","On his way out, Barry sneaked onto the set of “Samson et Dalila,” on the main stage. “Can you imagine filling this space with sound?” he asked, and thought about how the actors must feel on opening night. “Terrifying.”"],["p","Exiting the building, he teased a security guard—“Are you taking candy from women again?”—and spoke of the ideal fight as one that achieves a “fine balance between reality and theatricality.” Then he stepped onto his scooter and sped away. ♦"]]],"canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"sections":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"},"slug":"magazine","children":[{"id":"5ba59b911041812d14a202ec","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5ba59b911041812d14a202ec","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Pulled Punches Dept.","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"pulled-punches-dept"},{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"},{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"}],"name":"Pulled Punches Dept.","parent":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"},"slug":"pulled-punches-dept"}]}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"magazine","contentTags":[{"name":"B.

south-central ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/utah"},"Utah"],", where the topography is spectacular, desolate, and extreme, the pessimistic tradition in place-names runs strong. Head south from Poverty Flat and you’ll end up in Death Hollow. Head east from Dead Mare Wash and you’ll end up on Deadman Ridge, looking out toward Last Chance Creek and down into Carcass Canyon. During the Great Depression, when the whole state turned into a kind of Poverty Flat, the Civilian Conservation Corps sent a group of men to the region to carve a byway out of a virtually impassable landscape of cliffs and chasms. The men nicknamed the project Poison Road: so steep that a single drop would kill them. Midway up, the ridge they were following gaped open and plunged fifteen hundred feet to the canyon floor. They laid a span across it, and called it Hell’s Backbone Bridge."],["p","Today, the entire route built by those men is known as Hell’s Backbone Road. Still largely unpaved, still treacherous in bad weather, it connects the town of Escalante to the tiny hamlet of Boulder, long reputed to be one of the most remote settlements in the continental United States. As late as 1940, the mail there was delivered via an eight-hour trek by mule team; the first lights did not flicker on until Christmas Eve, 1947. Until the nineteen-seventies, locals had to spend up to forty-eight hours in transit to obtain any number of essential goods and services: a new pair of socks, medical care, anything beyond an eighth-grade education."],["p","Eventually, the county paved a different road into town, the two-lane Highway 12; as a result, assuming that you are already in Utah, getting to Boulder is no longer particularly difficult. Yet by contemporary standards the town remains strikingly out of the way. Its population hovers around two hundred and fifty people, many of whom bear the same last names as the earliest Westerners to settle the area: to the extent that Boulder is full at all, it is full of Kings and Roundys, Lymans and Ormonds and LeFevres. Most of those families came to Utah because they were ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/mormons"},"Mormon"]," and came to Boulder to pasture their cattle, and the twin influences of the Latter-day Saints and ranching still dominate today. Boulder is the kind of place where those who aren’t related by blood are related by marriage, and those who aren’t related by either are effectively kin by proximity—the kind of place, in short, where everyone knows everyone else’s children, parents, politics, struggles, scandals, and cattle brands."],["p","Despite its small population, Boulder is geographically large—twenty-one square miles, about the size of Manhattan. Most of that space is occupied by farms and ranches; there is no bank in town, no A.T.M., no grocery store, no fast food, no medical clinic, no pharmacy. For that matter, there is no town in town—no business district, no Main Street, not even a traffic light. Instead, scattered along or just off Highway 12, there is a post office, an elementary school, a town hall, and a state park. There is a ten-room motel, a three-room motel, a convenience store, a church, and a gift shop. And down at the end of town, just before the road starts climbing steeply back into the wilderness, there is a hotel called the Boulder Mountain Lodge, and, on its grounds, a restaurant called Hell’s Backbone Grill."],["p","Actually, the restaurant is the second Hell’s Backbone Grill. The first one opened in 1996, closed in 1999, and sat empty until it was acquired, for three thousand borrowed dollars, by two women who had never attended culinary school or started a restaurant or lived in Utah. Nonetheless, in 2000 they moved to Boulder, reopened Hell’s Backbone Grill, and, in short order, changed everything about it except the name. In the years since then, it has gained a reputation as one of the best restaurants in the Southwest, and also the most improbable. It is an all-organic, sourcing-obsessed, vegetarian-friendly venture in the middle of a traditional ranching community; a part-hippie, part-hipster, Buddhist-influenced culinary retreat in conservative Mormon country; a farm-to-table operation in a landscape not exactly known for its agricultural bounty; and a high-end, foodie-magnet restaurant that is four hours on a good day from the nearest major metropolitan area."],["inline-embed",{"type":"callout","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22callout%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22inset-left%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22cartoon%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522cartoon%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%2522%252Fcartoon%252F5ba408c77365a059ff5a65f4%2522%252C%2522width%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522height%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522caption%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%225ba408c77365a059ff5a65f4%5C%22%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%22%2C%22attrs%22%3A%7B%7D%7D","ref":""},["inline-embed",{"type":"cartoon","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22cartoon%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22%2Fcartoon%2F5ba408c77365a059ff5a65f4%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":"5ba408c77365a059ff5a65f4"}]],["p","Yet somehow, despite its unlikely vision and inhospitable location, Hell’s Backbone Grill has managed to flourish.

Castle and Blake Spalding, the co-owners of Hell’s Backbone Grill, met in 1997, while working as cooks for rafting trips in the Grand Canyon. In contemporary American life, there are few circumstances less conducive to preparing decent food. The two worked for different outfits, but the routine was basically the same: before each trip, everything they needed, from the salt to the stove, was sealed into waterproof containers and trekked to the bottom of the canyon, where it was loaded onto boats and transformed into meals at portable kitchens reconstituted daily on the banks of the Colorado River. Some days, sand got into everything. Occasionally, a boat would flip and the dairy cooler would vanish downstream. Once, Spalding got into a fight with a ring-tailed cat that sank its teeth into two pounds of roast beef."],["p","Still, it was wild and beautiful and, as jobs in food go, much better than those which had marked the two women’s earliest working years. Both Spalding and Castle came from financially strapped families, started cooking young, and did stints at, respectively, Bob’s Big Boy and McDonald’s. Spalding was raised in New Hampshire and Arizona, by former beatniks who expected their three children to fend for themselves. As the oldest, she was responsible, by age eleven, for getting food on the table several days a week; by twelve, she took her first cooking job, picking lobsters and frying clams at a local seafood shack. Later, she put herself through Northern Arizona University by tending bar and, in the nineteen-nineties, started her own catering company."],["p","Castle, who was raised by a single mother in New Mexico, learned to cook young because it was a way to help at home, and learned “to cook big,” because her mother was one of thirteen and the extended family ate together regularly. At eighteen, she started college in Flagstaff, found it hugely expensive and minimally useful, dropped out, and began working at a café there instead. She stayed for seven years, clocking in at 2 ",["em",{"class":"small"},"a"],".",["em",{"class":"small"},"m"],"., clocking out at nine, then going straight to the public library to pore over cookbooks, jotting down recipes and refining her own. Eventually, she arranged her schedule so that she could work in the Grand Canyon as well, which is where she met Spalding."],["p","By then, Spalding’s catering career had taken an unexpected turn. One day out on the river, another boat caught up with hers in order to deliver a fax: she’d been offered a job cooking for the cast and crew of MTV’s “The Real World” on an island in the Exuma Cays. She accepted the job, followed by others in reality television that took her everywhere from North Carolina to Suriname. Then the Discovery Channel invited her to cater a show in the Pacific Northwest, and asked if she knew anyone who could help."],["p","The timing was propitious; Castle had just broken up with a boyfriend and was looking to get away. For the next month, she and Spalding lived in a tent, cooking constantly, barely sleeping, and discovering that they worked together exceptionally well. That was partly because, like many successful collaborators, they are strikingly different. Spalding, who is older by eight years, is an extrovert and a risk-taker, qualities that, combined with her placid cheeriness and thoroughgoing sincerity, make her seem something like a good witch: formidable yet benevolent. Castle, by contrast, is a pragmatist and a worrier: systematic, detail-oriented, inclined to lie awake at night contemplating the optimal texture of cake. What they have in common is an intense work ethic, an ability to laugh even in extremis, and an abiding admiration for each other. “I’m just me and she’s just her,” Spalding says, “but between us we’re six people.”"],["p","Although Castle loved the Discovery Channel gig, she finished it feeling “done with smelling like garlic and coffee,” and decided to quit cooking. Spalding, however, had other plans. After the job ended, she visited Boulder and found Hell’s Backbone Grill sitting empty; back in Arizona, she asked Castle to help start a restaurant in a remote Utah town. “I was, like, ‘What? No. That’s crazy. And, besides, I don’t want to cook anymore,’ ” Castle said. Spalding, persuasive as ever, pointed out that at least she wouldn’t have to go to work at two in the morning or sleep in a tent.

1996, four years before Spalding and Castle plated their first meal at Hell’s Backbone Grill, President Bill Clinton announced the creation of Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument: 1.7 million acres of Utah wilderness, later expanded by Congress to 1.9 million, to be protected in perpetuity."],["p","Clinton drew his authority to do so from the 1906 Antiquities Act, an influential piece of legislation that permits Presidents to unilaterally designate as national monuments any federal lands they deem culturally, historically, or scientifically significant. It was signed into law during the second term of Theodore Roosevelt, who then used it eighteen times in three years, to protect everything from Devils Tower, in Wyoming—the first national monument—to the Grand Canyon. With the exceptions of Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, and George H. W. Bush, every subsequent President has made use of the Antiquities Act. Collectively, they have designated a hundred and fifty-five monuments, from the African Burial Ground, in New York City, to the Gates of the Arctic, in Alaska."],["p","Before Grand Staircase-Escalante joined those ranks, very few people outside Utah knew anything about the lands within it. Even the new monument’s name reflected, on both sides of its hyphen, a certain confusion. The Franciscan friar Silvestre Vélez de Escalante did explore parts of Utah, but he never set foot in the region that now bears his name. The eponymous Grand Staircase, meanwhile, stretches far beyond the monument’s boundaries. That’s because it is not a single geological feature, like the arches at Arches or the bend at Big Bend, but a metaphor for a series of cliffs and plateaus that work their way upward from the Grand Canyon in Arizona to Utah’s Aquarius Plateau, the highest tableland in North America, which runs for a hundred miles along the monument’s northern edge."],["p","Although Native Americans lived in what would become Grand Staircase for twelve thousand years, early European-Americans avoided the area assiduously; so daunting was its terrain that, for centuries, it deflected the otherwise unstoppable force of Manifest Destiny. As late as 1868, a U.S. War Department map of the western United States contained an enormous blank spot where the monument would one day be. In 1871, when the explorers of the second Powell expedition arrived at the edge of that blank spot, their leader looked out on the “multitude of chasms before us,” and declared that “no animal without wings” could cross it. When they crossed it anyway, they encountered both the last river and the last mountains in the Lower Forty-eight to be named and mapped."],["inline-embed",{"type":"callout","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22callout%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22inset-left%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22cartoon%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522cartoon%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%2522%252Fcartoon%252F5ba408c77365a059ff5a65f3%2522%252C%2522width%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522height%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522caption%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%225ba408c77365a059ff5a65f3%5C%22%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%22%2C%22attrs%22%3A%7B%7D%7D","ref":""},["inline-embed",{"type":"cartoon","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22cartoon%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22%2Fcartoon%2F5ba408c77365a059ff5a65f3%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":"5ba408c77365a059ff5a65f3"}]],["p","Under Clinton, all that land was reborn as the largest national monument in the continental United States. It straddles two counties, Kane and Garfield, which have a combined population of twelve thousand people, most of whom live in towns on the monument’s perimeter. The smallest of these is Boulder, which sits almost seven thousand feet above sea level, in the shadow of the Aquarius Plateau. Although the town’s fate, like that of the rest of the region, has always been tied to the wilderness at its front door, the monument designation reversed the terms of that relationship: suddenly, the same remoteness that had always deterred outsiders began attracting them instead."],["p","That shift reflected a trend that was already well under way throughout Western rural areas: the transition from the Old West, with an economy based on farming, ranching, and resource extraction, to the New West, with an economy based on technology, tourism, and recreation.

early years of Hell’s Backbone Grill, which were also the early years of Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument, were not particularly easy ones for either entity. Bill Clinton was hanged in effigy and flags were lowered to half mast in nearby towns. Local officials encouraged illegal all-terrain-vehicle activity in the monument and ran bulldozers through its ostensibly protected land. The commissioners of Garfield County turned down a hundred thousand dollars in federal planning funds, deriding it as “blood money,” then spent many times that unsuccessfully suing the U.S. government. Even those in the region who were disinclined to spectacle, litigation, or lawlessness worried about the new monument’s potential impact on the regional economy."],["p","All told, it both was and was not an auspicious moment to open a restaurant in a gateway town. On the one hand, Spalding and Castle could count on revenue from tourists who stopped for a meal on their way through Grand Staircase. “We never would have moved here if the monument hadn’t been declared,” Spalding said. “We’re crazy, but not that crazy.”"],["p","On the other hand, it wasn’t an ideal time to settle in Boulder, which, even under the best of circumstances, is wary of interlopers. Nor was the town initially enthusiastic about the new restaurant in its midst. The issue wasn’t expense, exactly; although Hell’s Backbone Grill charges big-city prices, it offered residents a fifty-per-cent discount in the early years, bringing the bill for, say, a ten-dollar pancake breakfast down to what it would cost at an ",["em",{"class":"small"},"IHOP"],". (These days, the discount is twenty per cent.) The bigger problem had to do with identity: food typically contains almost as many cultural markers as calories, and the kind that Spalding and Castle serve was, at first, utterly foreign to many of their neighbors."],["p","Spalding had long believed that cooking was a moral and political act, one capable of either contributing to or ameliorating environmental and health issues. Castle came later to food ethics (when she met Spalding, she said, “I thought ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/alice-waters"},"Alice Waters"]," was Alice Walker. I was, like, ‘I loved “The Temple of My Familiar” ’ ”), but by the time they bought Hell’s Backbone Grill they shared a vision of local, organic, responsibly sourced meals made from scratch. That vision was not shared, however, by most of America in 2000. Organic restaurants were still scarce, the farm-to-table movement was barely getting started, and the word “locavore” had yet to be coined. According to the ",["em","Salt Lake Magazine"]," editor and food writer Mary Brown Malouf, the culinary culture of Utah at the time consisted chiefly of whatever the Sysco truck delivered."],["p","In that context, what some Boulder residents found off-putting about Hell’s Backbone Grill wasn’t its prices but its dishes: slow-cooked things, grass-fed things, sage-smashed potato pancakes, seared duck with rose-hip cream sauce. A curious feature of the local-food movement is that it is sometimes alienating to actual locals; the people most likely to recognize prickly pears or tumbleweeds in the wild may be the ones least inclined to pay for the pleasure of eating them."],["p","Along with their different ideas about food, Spalding and Castle parted ways with most of Boulder on religion. The town was predominantly Mormon, while Castle was raised Catholic and Spalding has been a practicing Buddhist for twenty-five years; Hell’s Backbone Grill features a statue of Buddha in the garden and prayer flags on the patio. Socially, both women were respectful of the prevailing religion—Spalding, who has a cheerfully foul mouth, learned to curb it in a place where people routinely say “Shut the front door” and “Oh my heck”—but professionally it presented a problem. For restaurants, alcohol sales can be the difference between survival and insolvency, but observant Mormons do not drink, and Utah, known officially as the Beehive State and unofficially as the Behave State, has the strictest liquor laws in the nation. Just before Castle and Spalding bought Hell’s Backbone Grill, the Utah Supreme Court had affirmed the right of Boulder’s town council to prevent its previous owners from so much as applying for a liquor license."],["p","In short, almost everything seemed to be working against Spalding and Castle at first, including the fact that no one wanted to work ",["em","for"]," them. Their initial “Help Wanted” sign attracted zero interest, until finally the local postmistress took pity and told her teen-age daughter to go on down and apply. The rest of the staff was assembled in similar catch-as-catch-can fashion. At one point, Spalding persuaded her sister to move to town and help out, and when they were particularly shorthanded neither she nor Castle was above begging a pliable-seeming customer to stick around and work in exchange for meals. (Two years ago, a customer named Tim decided to stay for a different reason. He and Spalding now live together in Boulder, with a three-legged cat, a four-legged cat, two dogs, and seven goats.)"],["p","If hiring staff was challenging, acquiring ingredients was almost as difficult—chiefly because, in 2005, to make good on their commitment to local food, Spalding and Castle bought six acres of overgrazed horse pasture and started a farm. This was, as Spalding later put it, “a monumental pain in the ass.” Snow fell in June. Freak hailstorms wiped out whole crops. The wind blew away two consecutive greenhouses, inverted a third like an umbrella, whipped a field of peppers around until they effectively strangled themselves, and blew squash plants clean out of the ground. Mountain lions proved fond of honey and destroyed expensive bee boxes to obtain it. Worst of all was the soil, which consisted almost entirely of nutrient-free sand. As a result, the main thing that the Hell’s Backbone farmers had to learn to grow was dirt."],["inline-embed",{"type":"callout","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22callout%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22feature-small%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22image%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522image%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%2522%252Fphotos%252F5ba408c7f9deee71afe9e311%2522%252C%2522width%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522height%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522caption%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%225ba408c7f9deee71afe9e311%5C%22%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%22%2C%22attrs%22%3A%7B%7D%7D","ref":""},["inline-embed",{"type":"image","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22image%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22%2Fphotos%2F5ba408c7f9deee71afe9e311%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":"5ba408c7f9deee71afe9e311"}]],["p","And yet it was this same demanding land that drew Spalding and Castle to Boulder in the first place. On a clear day—and clear days are abundant in this part of Utah, which boasts some of the driest air and lowest pollution levels in the world—they could climb almost any rise outside their restaurant and look out over a hundred miles in all directions. From most places within Grand Staircase, there is, in all that distance, no visible or audible sign of human existence: no roads, no cars, no power lines, no cell towers, no buildings. At night, there are no artificial lights. Overhead, the sky goes dense and dimensional with stars; below, the land is so dark that you can spot a single hiker with a headlamp fifteen miles away."],["p","Filling up all that immensity is some of the most spectacularly wild terrain left on earth. There are the sheer cliffs and forested highlands of the Aquarius Plateau. There are, in shades of cream and copper and flame, the unlikely geometries of eroded sandstone: narrow gorges, strange whorls, sudden holes in the ground. There are California condors and desert tortoises and bighorn sheep and panthers. There are hanging gardens, slot canyons, vegetation that has lingered since the Pleistocene. There are astonishing quantities of two-hundred-million-year-old fossils, and the relics of multithousand-year-old cultures, and the world’s most continuous record of four billion years of geology."],["p","For Spalding and Castle, what was so captivating about Grand Staircase was its vastness of scale, both spatial and temporal. Nowhere else in the country, outside of Alaska, was so large a tract of land so relatively unspoiled—so ecologically close to the condition it had been in before Europeans arrived in North America. Paradoxically, that is a large part of why President Clinton had protected it: because, for millennia, it had done such an excellent job of protecting itself."]],["inline-embed",{"type":"section","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22section%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cp%3ELike%20many%20things%2C%20although%20not%20all%20things%2C%20life%20at%20the%20restaurant%20got%20better.%20On%20their%20first%20Fourth%20of%20July%20in%20town%2C%20Castle%20and%20Spalding%20threw%20an%20ice-cream%20social%2C%20complete%20with%20gallons%20of%20homemade%20toppings%2C%20then%20sat%20around%20worrying%20that%20no%20one%20would%20show%20up.%20Instead%2C%20most%20of%20the%20town%20materialized.%20The%20two%20women%20gradually%20befriended%20some%20of%20their%20neighbors%2C%20and%2C%20over%20time%2C%20employed%20many%20of%20them%2C%20including%20two%20identical-twin%20Mormon%20ranchers%2C%20a%20former%20cook%20at%20the%20elementary%20school%20plus%20her%20three%20children%20and%20two%20grandkids%2C%20a%20thirty-year-old%20business%20manager%20who%20began%20on%20the%20prep%20line%20as%20a%20teen%2C%20and%20seven%20of%20the%20fourteen%20children%20of%20a%20sixth-generation%20Boulder%20ranching%20family.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EEventually%2C%20when%20good%20will%20toward%20the%20restaurant%20had%20increased%20but%20its%20bottom%20line%20had%20not%2C%20Spalding%20and%20Castle%20approached%20the%20town%20council%20to%20ask%20permission%20to%20apply%20for%20a%20liquor%20license.%20Mindful%20of%20the%20pitched%20battles%20fought%20there%20over%20alcohol%20before%2C%20they%20kept%20their%20case%20to%20a%20single%20fact%3A%20a%20drinks%20menu%20would%20help%20keep%20their%20doors%20open.%20To%20the%20surprise%20of%20pretty%20much%20everyone%2C%20the%20council%20voted%20to%20let%20them%20apply.%20They%20did%2C%20and%20the%20state%20subsequently%20granted%20them%20a%20liquor%20license%2C%20the%20first%20in%20the%20history%20of%20Boulder.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3ESixteen%20years%20later%2C%20the%20bar%20at%20Hell%E2%80%99s%20Backbone%20Grill%20is%20full%2C%20and%2C%20from%20when%20it%20opens%2C%20in%20March%2C%20until%20it%20closes%2C%20just%20after%20Thanksgiving%2C%20the%20restaurant%20almost%20always%20is%2C%20too.%20Its%20dining%20room%2C%20which%20seats%20sixty-five%2C%20looks%20like%20a%20W.P.A.%20lodge%20if%20Martha%20Stewart%20had%20been%20around%20to%20do%20the%20decorating%3A%20warm%20and%20unshowy%2C%20with%20exposed%20beams%2C%20deep-red%20walls%2C%20and%20light%20fixtures%20fashioned%20from%20colanders%20that%20Spalding%20bought%20at%20thrift%20shops%20and%20spray-painted%20copper.%20Because%20some%20guests%20still%20stumble%20in%20by%20chance%20while%20others%20make%20reservations%20months%20ahead%2C%20the%20clientele%20is%20notably%20eclectic%3A%20bow%20hunters%20and%20backpackers%2C%20Paul%20Simon%20and%20Scarlett%20Johansson%20and%20%3Ca%20href%3D%5C%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fcontributors%2Fjamaica-kincaid%5C%22%3EJamaica%20Kincaid%3C%2Fa%3E.%20Some%20arrive%20in%20evening%20wear%2C%20some%20in%20flannel%2C%20some%20looking%20as%20if%20they%20forgot%20to%20wipe%20the%20grime%20and%20sunscreen%20off%20their%20faces.%20In%20the%20spring%20and%20the%20fall%2C%20cycling%20tours%20bring%20clients%20in%20weekly%3B%20one%20recent%20night%2C%20eight%20of%20them%20were%20seated%20next%20to%20a%20table%20full%20of%20the%20other%20kind%20of%20bikers%E2%80%94Mexican%20motorcyclists%2C%20midway%20through%20a%20Southwest%20circuit.%20Nearby%2C%20three%20generations%20of%20a%20family%2C%20in%20from%20Salt%20Lake%20to%20celebrate%20an%20engagement%2C%20were%20on%20their%20fifth%20meal%20at%20the%20restaurant%20in%20two%20days.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EAs%20the%20crowds%20suggest%2C%20Hell%E2%80%99s%20Backbone%20Grill%20is%20now%20thriving.%20The%20staff%20has%20stabilized%20at%20around%20fifty%20people%2C%20many%20of%20them%20returning%20for%20the%20twelfth%20or%20the%20sixteenth%20season%2C%20while%20the%20farm%20now%20yields%20some%20twenty-three%20thousand%20pounds%20of%20organic%20produce%20every%20year.%20Virtually%20all%20of%20that%20winds%20up%20on%20the%20menu%2C%20served%20up%20in%20what%20Castle%20and%20Spalding%20call%20%E2%80%9CFour%20Corners%20Cuisine%E2%80%9D%3A%20an%20updated%20combination%20of%20cowboy%20classics%2C%20Mormon%20recipes%2C%20and%20traditional%20Southwestern%20fare.%20With%20Spalding%E2%80%99s%20sister%20Lavinia%2C%20a%20travel%20writer%20and%20a%20former%20Hell%E2%80%99s%20Backbone%20employee%2C%20Castle%20and%20Spalding%20have%20also%20produced%20two%20cookbooks%2C%20%E2%80%9C%3Ca%20href%3D%5C%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FMeasure-Grace-Story-Recipes-Restaurant%2Fdp%2F0971936420%2Fref%3Dsr_1_1%3Fie%3DUTF8%26amp%3Bqid%3D1537797772%26amp%3Bsr%3D8-1%26amp%3Bkeywords%3DWith%2Ba%2BMeasure%2Bof%2BGrace%5C%22%3EWith%20a%20Measure%20of%20Grace%3C%2Fa%3E%2C%E2%80%9D%20in%202004%2C%20and%20%E2%80%9C%3Ca%20href%3D%5C%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FThis-Immeasurable-Place-Farming-Wilderness%2Fdp%2F0999458817%2Fref%3Dsr_1_1%3Fie%3DUTF8%26amp%3Bqid%3D1537797785%26amp%3Bsr%3D8-1%26amp%3Bkeywords%3DThis%2BImmeasurable%2BPlace%5C%22%3EThis%20Immeasurable%20Place%3C%2Fa%3E%2C%E2%80%9D%2

The two women gradually befriended some of their neighbors, and, over time, employed many of them, including two identical-twin Mormon ranchers, a former cook at the elementary school plus her three children and two grandkids, a thirty-year-old business manager who began on the prep line as a teen, and seven of the fourteen children of a sixth-generation Boulder ranching family."],["p","Eventually, when good will toward the restaurant had increased but its bottom line had not, Spalding and Castle approached the town council to ask permission to apply for a liquor license. Mindful of the pitched battles fought there over alcohol before, they kept their case to a single fact: a drinks menu would help keep their doors open. To the surprise of pretty much everyone, the council voted to let them apply. They did, and the state subsequently granted them a liquor license, the first in the history of Boulder."],["p","Sixteen years later, the bar at Hell’s Backbone Grill is full, and, from when it opens, in March, until it closes, just after Thanksgiving, the restaurant almost always is, too. Its dining room, which seats sixty-five, looks like a W.P.A. lodge if Martha Stewart had been around to do the decorating: warm and unshowy, with exposed beams, deep-red walls, and light fixtures fashioned from colanders that Spalding bought at thrift shops and spray-painted copper. Because some guests still stumble in by chance while others make reservations months ahead, the clientele is notably eclectic: bow hunters and backpackers, Paul Simon and Scarlett Johansson and ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/jamaica-kincaid"},"Jamaica Kincaid"],". Some arrive in evening wear, some in flannel, some looking as if they forgot to wipe the grime and sunscreen off their faces. In the spring and the fall, cycling tours bring clients in weekly; one recent night, eight of them were seated next to a table full of the other kind of bikers—Mexican motorcyclists, midway through a Southwest circuit. Nearby, three generations of a family, in from Salt Lake to celebrate an engagement, were on their fifth meal at the restaurant in two days."],["p","As the crowds suggest, Hell’s Backbone Grill is now thriving. The staff has stabilized at around fifty people, many of them returning for the twelfth or the sixteenth season, while the farm now yields some twenty-three thousand pounds of organic produce every year. Virtually all of that winds up on the menu, served up in what Castle and Spalding call “Four Corners Cuisine”: an updated combination of cowboy classics, Mormon recipes, and traditional Southwestern fare. With Spalding’s sister Lavinia, a travel writer and a former Hell’s Backbone employee, Castle and Spalding have also produced two cookbooks, “",["a",{"href":"https://www.amazon.com/Measure-Grace-Story-Recipes-Restaurant/dp/0971936420/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1537797772&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=With+a+Measure+of+Grace"},"With a Measure of Grace"],",” in 2004, and “",["a",{"href":"https://www.amazon.com/This-Immeasurable-Place-Farming-Wilderness/dp/0999458817/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1537797785&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=This+Immeasurable+Place"},"This Immeasurable Place"],",” in 2017, which feature profiles of Boulder residents and the restaurant’s staff as centrally as recipes."],["p","Yet it is those recipes which have made Hell’s Backbone Grill so beloved.

The ice-cream social has become an annual ritual; this Independence Day, Spalding and Castle gave away more than four hundred sundaes. Former employees have started other food-related ventures nearby, including a food truck that serves tacos and burritos in the parking lot of the state park. At Spalding’s invitation, a group of monks from the Drepung Loseling monastery, in South India, have spent a week in Boulder almost every year for eighteen years, and their visits are now as much a part of the town’s calendar as the school graduation and the Memorial Day parade."],["p","Although their business runs more smoothly than it did in the early years, Castle and Spalding still work just as hard.

One was Bears Ears, 1.35 million acres in the southeastern part of the state, protected by President Obama, which Trump reduced by eighty-five per cent.

a rule, national monuments are created to end controversies, not start them. Their roots often lie in some public-lands conflict so enduring and intractable that a President finally steps in, Antiquities Act in hand. Tempers flare, for a while the fuss gets worse, then it begins to settle down. Soon, the monument is accepted; eventually, it is beloved. Sometimes Congress goes on to turn it into a national park. Zion, Bryce, Acadia, Death Valley, Joshua Tree, the Grand Tetons, the Grand Canyon: all these and many more were originally national monuments."],["p","That is the general trajectory Grand Staircase was following until President Trump issued his proclamation and, as he has in so many arenas, rekindled old animosities. Support for the monument was broad and bipartisan; among Utah citizens who submitted public comments during the Department of the Interior’s review process, almost nine out of ten wanted it left intact, while a conservative pollster found that two out of three Utahans approved of Grand Staircase. But the commissioners of Kane and Garfield counties opposed it, as did the governor, the majority of the state legislature, and the entire Utah congressional delegation, all of whom had long despised the whole idea of public lands."],["p","That sentiment is common throughout the West, where it is the most notable regional instantiation of the grand American tradition of disliking the federal government. The Sagebrush Rebellion of the nineteen-eighties and the Wise Use movement of the nineteen-nineties both sought to diminish national land ownership and management, and both enjoyed strong support, from Texas up to Washington, Idaho, and Montana. But there is a reason that Trump cut monuments only in Utah. Among other Western politicians, shifting economies and demographics have begun to change attitudes toward public lands, but Utah’s governing class remains intensely hostile to federal authority."],["p","That hostility stems in part from a long history of conflict between the U.S. government and the Mormon Church. Driven steadily westward by religious persecution, the early Mormons arrived in Utah in the mid-nineteenth century and began trying to establish an autonomous theocracy. When the federal government declined to tolerate either that or the practice of polygamy, Church leaders found themselves in a bind. They were acutely aware of the benefits of joining the Union and petitioned to do so constantly over the course of forty years; at the same time, they were, as the apostle Orson Pratt wrote in 1845, “determined to get out of this evil nation.” The former impulse finally won out in 1896, when the Mormon leadership agreed, to the enduring dismay of some of the faithful, to abandon both polygamy and theocracy in exchange for statehood."],["p","Upon joining the Evil Nation, Utahans also found themselves surrounded by it: the United States owns two-thirds of Utah, a higher percentage than anywhere except Nevada. (By contrast, it owns 0.6 per cent of New York.) The federal government compensates states for lost property taxes on those lands and shoulders the hefty cost of managing them, while the states reap the financial benefits of tourism. Critics nonetheless talk about that arrangement as if the Feds had seized the state’s most precious assets, but historically the opposite has been true: for most of its existence, the U.S. government was in the business of transferring land ",["em","to"]," the states, generally by giving it away for free, through land grants and the Homestead Acts. Most of what it kept for itself was terrain that no right-minded settler wanted—including those millions of acres which so daunted the Powell expedition."],["p","Because all that acreage already belonged to the United States, the creation of Grand Staircase didn’t increase the total amount of public land in Utah. Indeed, by law national monuments can be made only from land the federal government already owns. Clinton’s designation did, however, change what activities were permitted inside the monument’s boundaries: mining and drilling were prohibited, while ranching was allowed to continue. But many locals mistrusted Clinton (he lost the 1992 Presidential election in Utah not only to George Bush but also to Ross Perot), and, despite the grazing provision, many ranchers were convinced that the monument would destroy the cattle industry."],["p","That fear resonated deeply in a region settled by ranchers, and once Trump took office politicians seized on it to make the case for cutting Grand Staircase. The Garfield County commission chairperson, Leland Pollock, claimed that the monument had “eliminated most grazing,” while Representative Chris Stewart said it had “kicked ranchers off the range.” A

like these drive monument supporters batty, for the straightforward reason that almost none of them are true. Prior to 1996, Garfield County had an unemployment rate of more than twelve per cent, the highest in Utah, while its per-capita income was fourteen per cent below the state average. Since the monument was established, though, per-capita income in the region has grown by seventeen per cent, higher than the Utah average, and employment has grown by twenty-four per cent, with Grand Staircase supporting some sixteen hundred new private-sector jobs. Many of those are at locally owned businesses, and not all are in tourism; finance, health care, and construction jobs are also on the rise, and a building boom in Boulder and Escalante has left contractors with multiyear waiting lists.

What hurt ranchers around Grand Staircase was the rise of factory farming, plus other market forces that made everything from fuel to feed more expensive while the price of beef failed to keep pace—factors that long predate the creation of the monument."],["p","No changes to the status of Grand Staircase could reverse those trends, and, except rhetorically, the decision to redraw its boundaries had nothing to do with the cattle industry. It did, however, have to do with other industries. In addition to removing almost nine hundred thousand acres from protection, Trump’s proclamation carved the remaining land into three separate units: Grand Staircase, Kaiparowits, and Escalante Canyons. The logic governing those boundaries became clear this summer, when the Department of the Interior accidentally released a report that contained extensive information—redacted in a subsequent version—on the whereabouts, within the original monument, of oil, gas, coal, tar sands, copper, cobalt, uranium, and other natural resources. The location of those resources made plain that the restructuring amounted to a kind of environmental gerrymandering: Grand Staircase had been carved up to maximize access for extractive industries."],["p","Proponents of that change argue that it will strengthen the regional economy, but that assertion is doubtful. Take coal: there is an enormous amount of it within the monument, but virtually zero demand for it. In a report on the impending closure of a mine just outside Grand Staircase, the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis noted, “The overall coal sector, which includes coal plants and mines, is in structural decline. There is no market for the power from the plant or for coal from the mine.” Other resources remain lucrative, but not necessarily for locals: most energy and mining companies are national or multinational operations that bring in many of their own employees, and the industry as a whole is subject to boom-and-bust cycles that can devastate on-site communities both culturally and financially."],["p","In reality, the most lucrative thing about Grand Staircase is the landscape itself. As of 2016, the outdoor-recreation industry in the United States brought in three hundred and seventy billion dollars, more than twice the value of the oil-and-gas industry. Twelve billion of those recreation dollars currently fuel Utah’s economy, but they will dry up around Grand Staircase if it is opened to resource extraction. Any mines or wells in the area would require an enormous amount of new infrastructure—roads, processing plants, storage facilities, pipelines—and industrial pollutants would contaminate air and water alike. All this would affect even ostensibly protected lands, because, under the new plan, Grand Staircase no longer abuts Capitol Reef and Bryce Canyon, leaving those national parks exposed to downstream effects. Indeed, two of the three new mini-monuments don’t even abut each other, eliminating not only ecological buffer zones but also wildlife corridors."],["p","In shrinking Grand Staircase, Trump parroted critics who claim that they don’t object to the monument per se, only to its size. But ecologists have known for decades that, in the long run, one of the single most devastating things you can do to an ecosystem is make it smaller. Put a road through Grand Staircase and you don’t just bisect it; as the science writer David Quammen once observed, you tear it in half, like fabric, and the natural world on both sides begins to unravel.

But they also knew that any major changes to the monument could likewise imperil their livelihood. It didn’t take them long to decide what to do. In the Grand Canyon, they had been taught that, if the boat tips and you fall into the river, you don’t panic and look around for someone to save you. “You get your bearings and swim like hell,” Spalding said. “You participate in your own rescue.”"],["p","One virtue of life in a small town is that getting your bearings is relatively easy. At most, Spalding and Castle were a degree or two removed from everyone in the region, and they began reaching out to others who cared about the monument. They met with business owners who depended on it for income, conservationists who valued it as wilderness, and scientists who regarded it as one of the planet’s greatest field-work locations. (With less than seven per cent of it surveyed, the monument has already yielded some six thousand archeological sites and forty-five new paleontological species, including twelve previously unknown dinosaurs.) They joined Grand Staircase Escalante Partners, the official friends group for the monument, and got to know its executive director, Nicole Croft. Between rejiggering the menu and replacing the fan in the walk-in freezer, they began speaking out—to neighbors, customers, politicians, the press—about their devotion to the monument."],["p","This change was not entirely easy for either woman. Spalding has always cared about politics and long been an evangelist for ethical food—she is happy to explain to customers for the umpteenth time why they shouldn’t want to see salmon on the menu in Utah—but she also possesses enough empathy and business savvy that she was mindful of potentially alienating neighbors or customers. Castle, meanwhile, is “by nature a behind-the-scenes worker” who would rather be in the relative privacy of the Hell’s Backbone kitchen than onstage for a land-use panel. On top of that, neither of them was in the market for a longer to-do list. After nearly twenty years, life at the restaurant had achieved a more reasonable rhythm, and spending what little free time they had on political organizing was not part of the plan."],["p","It was, however, part of a phenomenon. For some left-leaning Americans, many of them middle-class white women whose prior political frustrations were tempered by a buffer of distance and privilege, life under the Trump Administration has produced an entirely new experience: the disbelief, impotence, and rage of being unable to prevent immoral or unlawful actions. The shock of that experience has galvanized some of those women, sending self-described little old ladies to their first protests, motivating suburban moms who couldn’t previously name their political representatives to start calling them daily, and inspiring twentysomethings to run for office. Taken as a whole, such women are neither exceptionally driven nor exceptionally radical; other activists have been at it far longer, and for more progressive causes. But of all demographic groups in America, the Harvard sociologist Theda Skocpol and the University of Pittsburgh historian Lara Putnam observed in a study earlier this year, it is these women whose “political practices have most changed under Trump.”"],["p","For Spalding and Castle, as for many others, that change began with trying to get their representatives to represent them, an experience that was reliably frustrating. They got up before dawn to drive two and a half hours to a county-commission meeting to voice support for the monument, only to have the commissioners unanimously pass a resolution in favor of shrinking it. Together with all fifty-three members of the Escalante and Boulder Chamber of Commerce, they tried to tell Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke how much Grand Staircase meant to their business—first in letters, which got no response, then in person when he visited Utah for a “listening tour,” during which he met only with monument critics, and finally by sending a delegation to Washington, D.C., where he likewise refused to see them. “I called his office daily,” Spalding said, “saying, ‘I’m Blake Spalding, I’m the largest employer in the north end of this county, we pay nearly a million dollars a year in payroll, I want to talk to you about what the monument has meant for our business.’ No one ever called me back.”"],["inline-embed",{"type":"callout","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22callout%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22inset-left%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22cartoon%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522cartoon%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%2522%252Fcartoon%252F5ba408c733eb496e0686c8aa%2522%252C%2522width%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522height%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522caption%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%225ba408c733eb496e0686c8aa%5C%22%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%22%2C%22attrs%22%3A%7B%7D%7D","ref":""},["inline-embed",{"type":"cartoon","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22cartoon%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22%2Fcartoon%2F5ba408c733eb496e0686c8aa%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":"5ba408c733eb496e0686c8aa"}]],["p","When public pressure didn’t work, Spalding and Castle started looking for other options. One of these walked into their restaurant last year, in the form of Garett Rose, an attorney with the international law firm Covington &amp; Burling. Rose (who now works at the Natural Resources Defense Council) had flown to Utah to meet with Grand Staircase Escalante Partners, and, at Nicole Croft’s suggestion, came by Hell’s Backbone Grill to discuss possible legal remedies if the monument was altered. Over the course of two days and several meals, he outlined what the firm had in mind: suing the President of the United States."],["p","As with so many of Trump’s actions, the decision to shrink national monuments was so unusual as to raise the question of whether it was also illegal. In the hundred-and-twelve-year history of the Antiquities Act, Presidents had expanded their predecessors’ monuments frequently but contracted them in any significant measure only four times. (Minor reductions in acreage were common, and one President, William Howard Taft, reduced his ",["em","own"]," monument significantly.) None of those major reductions were ever litigated, leaving a constitutional question unanswered: does the authority to reverse a monument designation lie with Congress or with the President?"],["p","To Covington &amp; Burling, the answer was clear: it lay with Congress, and, if Trump arrogated that power to himself, the firm was prepared to take on a lawsuit pro bono. At the lawyers’ request, Spalding and Castle drew up an affidavit describing what would happen to their restaurant if the designation changed. On December 4, 2017, the day the proclamations became public, Covington &amp; Burling, acting on behalf of Grand Staircase Escalante Partners and two other nonprofit organizations, sued Ryan Zinke and Donald Trump."],["p","That lawsuit was one of five filed that day against the President. Two of the suits concerned Grand Staircase and three concerned Bears Ears; they have since been consolidated, so that the cases about each monument will be heard together. In the meantime, Covington &amp; Burling has filed a motion for summary judgment, while the Department of Justice has requested a venue change, from Washington, D.C., to Utah, a move that all the plaintiffs oppose. Those requests are presently awaiting rulings by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. Since the monument cases raise a previously unlitigated question concerning the separation of powers, they are, in all likelihood, headed for the Supreme Court. But lawsuits tend to move slowly, and by the time Grand Staircase Escalante Partners et al. v. Donald J. Trump et al. gets litigated at the district level and then, inevitably, appealed, we will be past 2018, past 2019, probably even past 2020. A new President may or may not be in the White House; a new ethos may or may not prevail about public lands."],["p","Disinclined to sit around in the interim, Spalding and Castle, like many of their fellow-activists, have increasingly turned their attention to electoral politics. They still speak out about Grand Staircase, and they still bring allies over for strategizing and dinner. But, mindful that only political change will protect the monument in the long term, they have begun campaigning for Marsha Holland and Shireen Ghorbani, pro-conservation candidates running for, respectively, the Utah and U.S. House of Representatives, and they have thrown their weight behind Better Boundaries, a bipartisan organization with an anti-gerrymandering measure on the ballot in Utah this fall."],["p","Neither Spalding nor Castle has any illusions about the magnitude of the battle they are fighting: they live in one of the most conservative regions of one of the most conservative states in the nation. Still, as the owners of a successful farm-to-table restaurant in rural Utah, they are perhaps less daunted than most of us by long odds. More to the point, they can’t imagine any other course of action. “I made a deal with myself when I saw the writing on the wall,” Spalding said. “I would say yes to everything I could to save the monument. When all this is over, whatever the outcome, I want to be able to say that I did everything I could.”"]],["inline-embed",{"type":"section","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22section%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cp%3EIn%20the%20meantime%2C%20there%20are%20black-powder%20biscuits%20on%20the%20breakfast%20menu%20at%20Hell%E2%80%99s%20Backbone%20Grill%2C%20and%20a%20Backbone%20B.L.T.%20for%20lunch%2C%20and%20braised%20beef%20with%20green-chile%20polenta%20for%20dinner.%20There%20is%20a%20%E2%80%9CSave%20Grand%20Staircase%E2%80%9D%20sign%20out%20by%20the%20Buddha%20in%20the%20garden%20and%2C%20at%20the%20hostess%20station%2C%20a%20stack%20of%20fact%20sheets%20about%20the%20monument%2C%20complete%20with%20contact%20information%20for%20Congress%20members.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3ESpalding%2C%20manning%20the%20late%20shift%2C%20still%20offers%20a%20buss%20on%20the%20cheek%20to%20old%20friends%2C%20a%20how%E2%80%99s-your-meal%20to%20new%20arrivals%2C%20a%20complimentary%20bottle%20of%20organic%20soda%20to%20a%20customer%20reluctant%20to%20try%20it.%20But%20beneath%20her%20unfailingly%20warm%20and%20calm%20demeanor%2C%20she%20says%2C%20%E2%80%9CI%E2%80%99m%20in%20a%20rage%2C%20to%20be%20quite%20honest.%20I%E2%80%99m%20nice%20to%20the%20monument%20opponents%20I%20know%2C%20but%20I%20do%20not%20hesitate%20to%20tell%20people%20when%20they%20get%20here%20that%20they%20have%20arrived%20at%20a%20remote%20outpost%20of%20the%20resistance.%E2%80%9D%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EOut%20of%20other%20restaurants%20come%20celebrity%20chefs%3B%20at%20Hell%E2%80%99s%20Backbone%20Grill%2C%20Spalding%20and%20Castle%20have%20become%20activist%20chefs%20instead.%20In%20doing%20so%2C%20they%20have%20learned%20the%20lesson%20of%20countless%20other%20outspoken%20citizens%20before%20them%3A%20when%20you%20stand%20up%2C%20you%20stick%20out.%20They%20do%20their%20best%20to%20brush%20off%20vicious%20Facebook%20comments%20and%20hostile%20visitors%20and%20bad-faith%20bad%20reviews%20(%E2%80%9CPeople%20write%20us%20shitty%20Trip%20Advisors%20and%20I%E2%80%99m%2C%20like%2C%20%E2%80%98You%20didn%E2%80%99t%20even%20eat%20here%2C%E2%80%99%20but%20whatever%2C%E2%80%9D%20Spalding%20says)%2C%20and%20they%E2%80%99ve%20learned%20that%20denatured%20alcohol%20and%20sandpaper%20will%20remove%20graffiti%20written%20in%20permanent%20marker.%20(%E2%80%9CLiberals%20are%20the%20new%20Nazis%2C%E2%80%9D%20someone%20scrawled%20this%20month%20in%20both%20of%20the%20restaurant%E2%80%99s%20bathrooms.)%20Other%20things%2C%20however%2C%20are%20harder%20to%20ignore.%20Last%20summer%2C%20Spalding%2C%20speaking%20at%20a%20major%20pro-monument%20rally%20in%20Salt%20Lake%20City%2C%20criticized%20Utah%E2%80%99s%20government%20for%20not%20defending%20public%20lands.%20Not%20long%20afterward%2C%20she%20and%20Castle%20were%20notified%20that%20Hell%E2%80%99s%20Backbone%20Grill%20had%20been%20selected%20for%20a%20comprehensive%20four-year%20audit%20by%20the%20state.%20The%20only%20other%20two%20vocally%20pro-monument%20businesses%20in%20Boulder%20were%20also%20audited.%20Whether%20or%20not%20the%20move%20was%20punitive%2C%20they%20worry%20about%20other%20forms%20of%20retaliation%2C%20and%20find%20themselves%20increasingly%20embattled.%20%E2%80%9CThere%E2%80%99s%20not%20a%20day%20that%20goes%20by%20that%20I%20don%E2%80%99t%20feel%20like%20we%E2%80%99re%20doing%20some%20kind%20of%20hand-to-hand%20combat%2C%E2%80%9D%20Spalding%20said.%20%E2%80%9CThe%20effect%20it%E2%80%99s%20had%20on%20us%20and%20our%20staff%20is%20extremely%20destabilizing.%E2%80%9D%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EIt%20remains%20to%20be%20seen%20what%20other%20effects%20the%20shrinking%20of%20Grand%20Staircase%20will%20have%20on%20Hell%E2%80%99s%20Backbone%20Grill.%20Boulder%20is%20still%20a%20gateway%20town%2C%20only%20to%20a%20much%20smaller%20monument%20with%20a%20different%20name%2C%20Escalante%20Canyons.%20It%20is%20also%20now%20the%20gateway%20town%20to%20the%20first%20industrial%20incursion%20since%20Trump%E2%80%99s%20proclamation.%20In%20June%2C%20a%20Canadian%20mining%20company%20acquired%20cobalt%20and%20copper%20claims%20on%20land%20that%20was%20previously%20part%20of%20the%20monument.%20Those%20will%20likely%20be%20rendered%20void%20if%20the%20Trump%20Administration%20loses%20in%20court%2C%20but%20in%20the%20meantime%E2%80%94and%20the%20meantime%20could%20last%20a%20long%20time%E2%80%94the%20company%20has%20announced%20plans%20to%20begin%20surface%20exploration%20soon%20and%20drilling%20shortly%20afterward.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EIf%20those%20and%20other%20developments%20proceed%2C%20Spalding%20and%20Castle%20know%20that%20their%20days%20at%20Hell%E2%80%99s%20Backbone%20Grill%20could%20be%20numbered.%20People%20seldom%20make%20reservations%20months%20in%20advance%20to%20eat%20at%20restaurants%20in%20mining%20towns%2C%20or%20plan%20sightseeing%20vacations%20or%20cycling%20tours%20near%20trucking%20routes%20and%20pit%20mines.%20What%20took%20two%20entrepreneurs%20twenty%20years%20to%20build%20could%20be%20gone%20in%20a%20fraction%20of%20that%20time%2C%20together%20with%20things%20that%20took%20nature%20twenty%20thousand%20centuries.%3C%2Fp%3E

But beneath her unfailingly warm and calm demeanor, she says, “I’m in a rage, to be quite honest. I’m nice to the monument opponents I know, but I do not hesitate to tell people when they get here that they have arrived at a remote outpost of the resistance.”"],["p","Out of other restaurants come celebrity chefs; at Hell’s Backbone Grill, Spalding and Castle have become activist chefs instead. In doing so, they have learned the lesson of countless other outspoken citizens before them: when you stand up, you stick out. They do their best to brush off vicious Facebook comments and hostile visitors and bad-faith bad reviews (“People write us shitty Trip Advisors and I’m, like, ‘You didn’t even eat here,’ but whatever,” Spalding says), and they’ve learned that denatured alcohol and sandpaper will remove graffiti written in permanent marker. (“Liberals are the new Nazis,” someone scrawled this month in both of the restaurant’s bathrooms.) Other things, however, are harder to ignore. Last summer, Spalding, speaking at a major pro-monument rally in Salt Lake City, criticized Utah’s government for not defending public lands. Not long afterward, she and Castle were notified that Hell’s Backbone Grill had been selected for a comprehensive four-year audit by the state. The only other two vocally pro-monument businesses in Boulder were also audited. Whether or not the move was punitive, they worry about other forms of retaliation, and find themselves increasingly embattled. “There’s not a day that goes by that I don’t feel like we’re doing some kind of hand-to-hand combat,” Spalding said. “The effect it’s had on us and our staff is extremely destabilizing.”"],["p","It remains to be seen what other effects the shrinking of Grand Staircase will have on Hell’s Backbone Grill. Boulder is still a gateway town, only to a much smaller monument with a different name, Escalante Canyons. It is also now the gateway town to the first industrial incursion since Trump’s proclamation. In June, a Canadian mining company acquired cobalt and copper claims on land that was previously part of the monument. Those will likely be rendered void if the Trump Administration loses in court, but in the meantime—and the meantime could last a long time—the company has announced plans to begin surface exploration soon and drilling shortly afterward."],["p","If those and other developments proceed, Spalding and Castle know that their days at Hell’s Backbone Grill could be numbered. People seldom make reservations months in advance to eat at restaurants in mining towns, or plan sightseeing vacations or cycling tours near trucking routes and pit mines. What took two entrepreneurs twenty years to build could be gone in a fraction of that time, together with things that took nature twenty thousand centuries."],["p","That kind of rapid destruction has happened in the region before. When the first ranchers arrived in Boulder, they encountered nearly ideal rangeland: dense with bluegrass and bunchgrass and wild oats, veined with natural troughs to channel the rain. In the words of Nethella Woolsey, the daughter of the rancher John King, who arrived in time to enjoy the bounty, those were the “good old days”: there was nothing to do but turn your livestock out on the range, and no fees to pay in order to do so. Word soon spread, and men began bringing in cattle and sheep by the thousands."],["p","The good old days lasted ten years. By 1905, Woolsey wrote, “the rich meadows on the mountain plateau had turned to dust.” Cows died by the hundreds. The bloated bodies of sheep washed into streambeds, poisoning the drinking water. Overgrazing so denuded and compacted the hillsides that they couldn’t absorb rainfall or snowmelt. Instead, water poured off them in floods, eroding the ground as rapidly as in a time lapse. That pattern, repeated all over the West—the famous tragedy of the commons—is why the federal government finally stepped in, determining how much livestock the land could sustain and issuing permits accordingly. The ranchers, in the main, were not grateful."],["p","A century later, however, with that same land facing a different threat, the rest of us could learn a lesson from their mistakes. It is terrifying how quickly something can be destroyed, how fragile a seemingly robust system can turn out to be. Institutions that appear solid can crack, protections can decay, democratic norms can erode faster than riverbanks. A nation can seem as durable yet be as vulnerable as its physical terrain. One of the most beautiful things about being in Grand Staircase is that, out in the deep middle of it, with all of prehistory underfoot and twelve-billion-year-old starlight overhead, the world feels enduring and eternal. But that is, of course, an illusion. All things change.

by the Polish writer Olga Tokarczuk (Riverhead), is exciting in the way that unclassifiable things are exciting—that is to say, at times confoundingly so. It is intermittently a work of fiction, but it is also an exercise in theory, cultural anthropology, and memoir. The narrator, an unnamed Polish writer with a hungry eye and an unappeasable need to travel, presents an omnium-gatherum, a big book full of many peculiar parts: there are mini-essays on airports, hotel lobbies, the psychology of travel, guidebooks, the atavistic pleasures of a single Polish word, the aphorisms of E. M. Cioran. Some of these riffs, which themselves tend toward the aphoristic, are as short as a couple of sentences. They are interspersed with longer fictional tales, set all over the world and in different epochs, as if they were found objects and Tokarczuk merely an itinerant gatherer: a Polish man, on a Croatian island for a holiday, searches for his wife and child, who have gone missing; a classics professor, hired as a star lecturer for a Greek cruise, falls on board the boat, and dies in Athens; a Russian mother, long tethered to the care of her severely sick son, walks out of her home and her life, and experiments with a new, perilous existence, riding the Moscow metro and spending time with the homeless; a German doctor, obsessed with body parts (he keeps photographs of vulvae in cardboard boxes), travels to a conference to speak on his paper “The Preservation of Pathology Specimens Through Silicone Plastication.”"],["p","The book’s two great themes, twining the fictional and the nonfictional ficelles, are mobility and curiosity. Like her characters, our narrator is always on the move, and is always noticing and theorizing, often brilliantly. Early in “Flights,” she tells us that she is “drawn to all things spoiled, flawed, defective, broken,” to “anything that deviates from the norm, that is too small or too big.” Later, she tells us that she loves “",["a",{"href":"https://www.amazon.com/Moby-Dick-Thrift-Editions-Herman-Melville/dp/0486432157/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1537797334&amp;sr=8-1-spons&amp;keywords=Moby-Dick&amp;psc=1"},"Moby-Dick"],",” a book written out of “a genuine desire to portray the world.” Tokarczuk’s approach, like Melville’s, is encyclopedic and multiform. She turns nothing away. She relishes the sites of mobility—airports, cities, hotels, trains—and all the world’s exemptions, the things that got away: “the unique, the bizarre, the freakish.” These include the living—a woman she meets at the Stockholm airport who is compiling an unfinishable book on every crime ever committed, called “Reports on Infamy”—and the dead: collections of strange specimens, such as fetuses suspended in formaldehyde, relics in St. Vitus Cathedral (“the breasts of St. Anne, totally intact, kept in a glass jar”), Chopin’s heart (an oversized organ removed after his death and preserved in alcohol), or anatomical wax figures at the Josephinum medical museum, in Vienna. Emperor Joseph II, Tokarczuk announces with apparent approval, collected “every manifestation of the aberration of the world” in his “cabinet of curiosities.”"],["p","One of the book’s most suggestive micro-essays concerns Wikipedia, which Tokarczuk rightly lauds as a “wonder of the world,” a project to gather the entire globe’s knowledge. Characteristically—because Tokarczuk is herself intellectually mobile—she changes course in the second paragraph of her riff. The problem with Wikipedia is that it can contain only what we can represent in words:"],["blockquote",["p","We should have some other collection of knowledge, then, to balance that one out—its inverse, its inner lining, everything we don’t know, all the things that can’t be captured in any index, can’t be handled by any search engine. For the vastness of these contents cannot be traversed from word to word. . . . Matter and anti-matter. Information and anti-information."]],["p","Tokarczuk’s book is a cabinet of curiosities that must also include itself in the cabinet, which means that, formally, “Flights” can’t really hang together, and doesn’t attempt to. It’s a work both modish and antique, apparently postmodern in emphasis but fed by the exploratory energies of the Renaissance. Its literary lineage starts in the classics (sweet-natured, knowledge-rummaging Pliny), goes through Montaigne and Sir Thomas Browne, and then winds through Rilke’s diaristic “",["a",{"href":"https://www.amazon.com/Notebooks-Laurids-Brigge-Penguin-Classics/dp/0141182210/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1537797366&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=Notebooks+of+Malte+Laurids+Brigge"},"Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge"],",” the freewheeling fictions of Kundera and the magical ones of Calvino, the ",["a",{"href":"https://www.amazon.com/Diary-Margellos-World-Republic-Letters-ebook/dp/B008H32FO6/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1537797385&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=diaries+gombrowicz"},"diaries"]," of Gombrowicz. This mode could be called flâneurial essayism, worldly and hospitable; its motto might be King Lear’s chastened amnesty, “None does offend, none, I say, none.” Curiosity is mobility, in this way of being in the world.

Here, mobility is in danger of becoming an abstraction, and, because Tokarczuk repeatedly returns to her themes, the ironic effect is of a certain fixity."],["p","“Flights” begins beautifully. The narrator recalls her Polish childhood, and how she was drawn to the River Oder, an example of movement that serves for the rest of the book: “The river flowed on, parading, concerned only with its hidden aims beyond the horizon, somewhere far off to the north . . . those changing, roving waters into which—as I later learned—you can never step twice.” (The supple English makes the translation, by Jennifer Croft, look to have been easy, which it surely cannot have been.) The narrator, whose parents appear to have had deep roots in the country, a traditional existence punctuated only by annual vacations, tells us that she is thrilled by her unmoored existence: “I can’t extract nutrition from the ground, I am the anti-Antaeus. My energy derives from movement—from the shuddering of buses, the rumble of planes, trains’ and ferries’ rocking.”"],["p","Yet this will to wander, so appealing when it belongs to a specific narrator, gradually stiffens into dogma when dispersed in the text. Tokarczuk tells us that whenever she travels she happily “falls off the radar”; no one knows where she is. In any airport, she muses, there must be a lot of people like her, people who “start to exist when the immigration officers stamp their passports. . . . Fluidity, mobility, illusoriness—these are precisely the qualities that make us civilized. Barbarians don’t travel. They simply go to destinations or conduct raids.” Guidebooks, she fears, have “ruined the greater part of the planet,” partly because they contaminate this in-betweenness, this liminality, with the lead anchor of consumerist description. Later still, Tokarczuk has a couple of specialists in “travel psychology” announce, like hired expert witnesses, that “if we wish to catalog humankind in a convincing way, we can do so only by placing people in some sort of motion,” for “constellation, not sequencing, carries truth.” And, in the book’s most emphatic sermon, a homeless Russian seer—encountered by the Russian mother on her journeys through Moscow—delivers the equivalent of Captain Ahab’s on-deck monologue. “Sway, go on, move,” the seer inveighs. “He who rules the world has no power over movement and knows that our body in motion is holy. . . . This is why tyrants of all stripes . . . have such deep-seated hatred for the nomads—this is why they persecute the Gypsies and the Jews. . . .

You can understand why a Polish author, growing up with relatively little freedom to travel abroad, living what one of her characters describes as a “rotten, claustrophobic northern life in that absurd, unfriendly communist country of the late sixties,” might divide the world into happy free mobility on one side, and unhappy totalitarian fixity on the other. Kundera has also used sex and laughter as ecstatic slayers of a frozen political order. But these days Tokarczuk’s binarism sounds too close to easy campus wisdom, to postmodern piety, even to neoliberal commerce: leaving is good, staying is bad; deracination is expansive, rootedness is dangerous. We have become comfortable inheritors of what Zygmunt Bauman called “liquid modernity.” But ",["em","is"]," mobility always a good, always a predicate of freedom? I can imagine a book that cogently argues the opposite. Classical realism is sometimes accused of effacing its own literary labor; the cost of Tokarczuk’s flâneurial freedom is that it effaces the labor of travel. The unnamed, always single author, a sovereign self blissfully off the radar and with nothing to do but write in her notebook, moves with her repose undisturbed through arenas marked by the spoliation of mass tourism but rarely notices that vast, cheap mass movement, which of course includes her own easy transits. (The flâneuse always tends to exempt herself from the general condition.) And what of those large groups of people, the world’s unwanted, who would rather not be on the move, who would dearly love to stay rooted, and who had “started to exist” long before they left their country for somewhere else? It’s sometimes hard to ignore the fact that the novel was written more than a decade ago, before the current European crises. (It does not contain the word “migrant” or “refugee.”)"],["p","“Flights,” as intelligently openhearted and sharp-eyed as it is, is sometimes prone to whitewash even the First World travel experience: flight attendants are rapturously seen as “beautiful as angels,” and airports are described as having their own symphonic soundtrack, “a requiem that opens with the potent introitus of takeoff and closes with an amen descending into landing.” (Tell that to those unfortunates living near the airport in their unsellable houses.)

Tokarczuk is such a talented redescriber of the world, the book is at its best not in the ozone of abstraction but when it registers, as it so often does, particularities closer to the earth. Her discerning eye shakes things up, in the same way that her book scrambles conventional forms. Looking at a map of Greece, the narrator notices how beautiful the shape of the Peloponnese is: “the shape of a great maternal hand, not a human one, that is dipping into the water to check if the temperature is right for a bath.” There’s a witty entry about how the sleeper train is really just a “train for cowards,” a dormitory for those afraid to fly; and a marvellous account of insomnia in a hotel room, where the narrator flicks between TV channels—“You hold the remote out like a weapon, and you take shots at the very center of the screen. Each shot kills one channel, but then another follows directly on its heels.”"],["p","Her theoretical and dialectical experiments are at their richest when tied to local detail. She notices that airports have become almost self-sufficient cities, with promenades, gardens, shopping malls, and meditation rooms, and wonders whether cities may come to supplement their airports, rather than the usual way round. There is an entry, delivered with perfect ironic poise, about how unhappy people who speak no language other than English must be:"],["blockquote",["p","There are countries out there where people speak English. But not like us—we have our own languages hidden in our carry-on luggage, in our cosmetics bags, only ever using English when we travel, and then only in foreign countries, to foreign people. It’s hard to imagine, but English is their real language! Oftentimes their only language. They don’t have anything to fall back on or to turn to in moments of doubt."],["p","How lost they must feel in the world, where all instructions, all the lyrics of all the stupidest possible songs, all the menus, all the excruciating pamphlets and brochures—even the buttons in the elevator!—are in their private language. They may be understood by anyone at any moment, whenever they open their mouths. They must have to write things down in special codes. . . . I heard there are plans in the works to get them some little language of their own, one of those dead ones no one else is using anyway, just so that for once they can have something just for themselves."]],["p","Among the most moving of such apparently glancing but gently profound noticings is a single paragraph about a single Polish word. The narrator, walking in some unnamed place “along the steep banks of the ocean among the sharp leaves of yuccas,” rests in a shelter, where there is a guestbook, inscribed by the travellers who have come this way. The narrator’s eye is caught by a name and address: “Świebodzin, Poland.” She says the name out loud: “That funny, difficult name, against which the undisciplined tongue rebels, that soft, perverse ",["em","ś"]," that immediately brings a vague sensation, something like cold oilcloth spread over the kitchen table, a basket of freshly plucked tomatoes from the country garden, the smell of the fumes from the gas stove. It all combines to make Świebodzin the only real thing. There’s nothing else.”"],["p","Those sections saturated in the author’s Polishness are the most poignant and meaningful in the book. The cabinet of curiosities, glittering with all kinds of marvels, is just to be browsed; the travelling reader moves through it and past it. But, like the author, we snag on that Polish word, and its suggestion of cold oilcloth, garden tomatoes, and stove fumes. Such episodes deliberately complicate the book’s exaltation of mobility and its freedoms. We might see the book’s lovely, intransigent Polishness as akin to the author’s idea of the anti-Wikipedia. Chopin’s heart is information, which anyone can possess; a memory of stove fumes is not information but a particular, personal memory, which is likely to prompt one of our own. There is the utopian theory of mobility and endless curiosity, and there is our daily reality, which is composed of a billion familiar details, most of them indescribable—the rooms we sit in, and the dimmer rooms we were once raised in; the streets we live on, and the old streets we grew up on, which truly exist now only in our heads. There is the desirable horizon, but there is also the furrowed field, which we know so well and which has made us who we are."],["p","The book opens with a vivid evocation of the Oder River and its endless, Heraclitean possibilities but is anchored by an equally vivid evocation of a fixed Polish world: “the park, the greenhouses with their vegetables that grew in sad little rows, and the sidewalk with its concrete slabs where we would go to play hopscotch. . . . The hairdresser on the main square by the Town Hall was always there in the same apron, washed and bleached in vain because the clients’ hair dye left stains like calligraphy, like Chinese characters.” Later in “Flights,” in a kind of fictional reply to this overture, Tokarczuk offers a fictionalized story about a Polish woman who, after many years abroad, makes a long journey back home, to help a terminally ill former boyfriend end his life. It is one of the most affecting episodes in the book, and, once again, the remembered Polish details arrest the reader: “Their secondary school was a chilly old building where on two floors classrooms multiplied inside the broad hallways. . . . Boards covered in dark green rubber that could be moved up and down. One of the kids would be put in charge of moistening the sponge before each class.” When the woman eventually arrives in Poland, she goes to the dying man’s room. Her former lover makes a joke about the drip he is getting intravenously: breakfast, lunch, and dinner combined—“Pork chops and cabbage, apple pie and beer for dessert.” Tokarczuk adds, “Quietly she repeats after him the word for ‘cabbage,’ ",["em","kapusta"],", a word she had all but forgotten, and it is enough to make her hungry.” And the reader, too. ♦"]]],"canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"sections":[{"id":"59babd482af19b1403458545","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"59babd482af19b1403458545","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Books","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"books"},{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"},{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"}],"name":"Books","parent":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"},"slug":"books"},{"id":"5907ef77019dfc3494e9c911","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Books","parent":[],"photos":{},"slug":"books-tag"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"magazine","contentTags":[],"contentType":"article","contributors":[{"name":"James Wood","type":"author","title":"James Wood has been a staff writer and book critic at \u003cem&gt;The New Yorker\u003c/em&gt; since 2007.","email":"","bio":["div",["p","James Wood has been a staff writer and book critic at ",["em","The New Yorker"]," since 2007. In 2009, he won the National Magazine Award for reviews and criticism. He was the chief literary critic at the ",["em","Guardian"],", in London, from 1992 to 1995, and a senior editor at ",["em","The New Republic"]," from 1995 to 2007.

an iced chamomile tea at the midtown Radiance Tea House &amp; Books, whose ambient noise level (sixty decibels) is not much louder than a coffee percolator’s, Gregory Scott Farber described the app he created, SoundPrint, as “Yelp for noise.” The free program allows users to search for and grade restaurants and bars according to their sound level. “Places are getting louder,” Farber, who is forty-two, said. “People tell me, thirty or forty years ago you could go somewhere to eat and expect to have a conversation.” A non-practicing lawyer who works as a research analyst, Farber suffers from permanent hearing loss, brought on by meningitis, which he contracted when he was a baby. Like so many great inventions, Farber’s arose from a desire to find love—or, at least, a place to take a date."],["p","“When I was dating, I put a lot of effort into trying to pick quiet spots,” he said. “I’d Google ‘quiet restaurants.’ Then I would show up, and it would be blaring.” His hearing aid helped, but not enough. “Out of curiosity, I started taking decibel measurements.” He sent a list of his favorite serene haunts to friends in the hearing-loss community, and was soon inundated with requests. “My normal-hearing friends wanted the list, too.”"],["p","Farber ",["a",{"href":"https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2018/4/26/17275406/restaurant-noise-app"},"launched his app"]," last April. It includes a sound-level meter, so that diners and drinkers can take measurements using their smartphones, and upload them to the database. Who funds the project? “You’re looking at him,” Farber said, adding that the app produces no revenue. SoundPrint covers about two thousand cities, though only fifteen have a significant number of users. Farber recently analyzed the data from 2,376 Manhattan restaurants and bars, and the news did not bode well for ears. More than seventy per cent of the former and ninety per cent of the latter rated as “loud”—defined as between seventy-six and eighty decibels, or as noisy as an air-conditioner—or “very loud,” defined as eighty decibels and up (an alarm clock). According to the study, Chinese, Indian, and Japanese restaurants are the most muted; Mexican, the most ear-splitting. The neighborhood where you are most likely to hear a napkin fall is Chinatown.

The Afghan Kebab House, on Second Avenue at Seventy-first Street, a snug spot with rugs lining the walls, was so hushed that you could have eavesdropped on a table from across the street. A few diners huddled over kebab plates. “My clientele are quiet people,” the restaurant’s owner, Izmar Yalai, said. On the app, the noise level registered at sixty-one decibels. (Farber considers seventy-five or below to be tolerable for conversation.) Nearly as subdued was Smörgås Chef, the restaurant inside Scandinavia House, a Nordic cultural center in Murray Hill. Several sizable parties of blondes supped on gravlax and Swedish meatballs, while a sound system played “I Wanna Sex You Up,” by Color Me Badd, at a reasonable volume. Noise level: sixty-eight decibels."],["p",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/01/06/burp-castle"},"Burp Castle"],", a pub in the East Village, features Belgian beers and a vibe so monastic that, for years, the staff wore religious robes. (Some still do.) There is a toy guillotine on the bar, with a sign that warns “Shhhh. No loud talking. Whispering only!” On a recent Friday night, when all thirty or so seats were occupied, the rule was enforced several times by the bartender, Erin Culton, as well as by a number of patrons. “The clientele are very, very attached to this place,” Culton said. “The quiet thing is not a gimmick.” According to the app, the noise level was seventy-two decibels."],["p","Farber may have stumbled in adding the Library of Distilled Spirits, on East Thirteenth Street, to the list. This Hyatt Hotel bar clocked in at eighty-three decibels—about the volume of a passing diesel truck. But you haven’t heard anything until you’ve visited the festive, pan-Latin Yuca Bar and Restaurant, on Avenue A, where, at one point, the racket reached ninety-five decibels (belt sander). Yuca is not on the “Quiet List.” It received an average score of eighty-six decibels in the SoundPrint database. The clientele seemed unfazed, but a waiter begged to differ. “By two in the morning, my ears are ringing,” he said. ♦"]]],"canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"sections":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"},"slug":"magazine","children":[{"id":"5ba59bb550b3e42dd5353cc7","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5ba59bb550b3e42dd5353cc7","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Come Again?

like the animals,” a subtle friend of mine remarked, quietly, after hearing me expound at perhaps tiring length on my ambivalence toward Eugène Delacroix, the subject of a grand retrospective at the Metropolitan Museum. That shut me up. It was before I saw the show, and I hadn’t been thinking of the painter’s way with lions, tigers, and, especially, horses; then I did. It’s profound, of course. My trouble with the paragon of French Romanticism was, and remains, the turbid indefiniteness of his style, which never really coalesces and which topples, at times, into wackiness. What to make, for example, of “The Death of Sardanapalus” (1826-27), in which a lounging sultan looks bored as his naked concubines and his magnificent horse are slaughtered on his orders? (That big painting, like the artist’s touchstone “Liberty Leading the People,” from 1832—an inflation of the revolution of 1830, which had achieved little more than a change of kings—hasn’t left the Louvre for this show, but two small versions of “Sardanapalus” provide the gist.) It should disturb us to imagine anyone enjoying so sadistic a fantasy, but Delacroix isn’t owning up to anything. While plainly pleased to startle, he takes the subject as a pretext for amplifying his specialties of sinuous form, pulsating color, and virtuosic brushwork. The picture’s operative drama is all in the paint. Delacroix was an awful showoff. But observe the terrified horse. There’s a catch of sincerity about it."],["p","Delacroix was born in 1798. His mother was the daughter of a celebrated cabinetmaker. The chameleonic diplomat Talleyrand deemed himself the sire. One much older brother became a general in Napoleon’s army and another a soldier who was killed in the Battle of Friedland, in 1807. Delacroix’s legitimate father, once France’s minister of foreign affairs, died in 1805, and his mother in 1814, leaving him an orphan at sixteen. A year later, having had a passion for art since early childhood, he was studying with a follower of the neoclassicist master Jacques-Louis David. Delacroix posed shirtless as one of the shipwreck victims in “The Raft of the Medusa” (1818-19), the apotheosis of Romanticism by his older contemporary Théodore Géricault, whose death at the age of thirty-two, in 1824, of a tubercular infection complicated by a riding accident, removed an epochal talent. Absent him, Delacroix led the movement in ways that churned it like a stalled weather front. Viewing his work gives me a nagging sense that he’s a man auditioning for greatness. He is more than qualified. His skills are superlative and his spontaneity unfailingly on tap. The game is his to lose, but he won’t play it through to a satisfying outcome, because he is so wowed by his own proficiency."],["inline-embed",{"type":"callout","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22callout%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22feature-xsmall%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22image%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522image%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%2522%252Fphotos%252F5ba52ac06fe57d2c68713314%2522%252C%2522width%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522height%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522caption%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%225ba52ac06fe57d2c68713314%5C%22%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%22%2C%22attrs%22%3A%7B%7D%7D","ref":""},["inline-embed",{"type":"image","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22image%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22%2Fphotos%2F5ba52ac06fe57d2c68713314%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":"5ba52ac06fe57d2c68713314"}]],["p","Delacroix’s was essentially a literary, illustrative sensibility. In thrall to Dante, Shakespeare, Goethe, Walter Scott, and, especially, Byron, he took the tenor if not the identity of his subjects from their pages. He shrank from any engagement with the emerging modernity of Europe, to the point of eschewing for his drawings—featured at the Met in a companion show from the private collection of Karen B. Cohen—the period’s innovations in customized artist’s paper and other novel materials. This was in spite of his early braving of political themes, chiefly that of Turkish atrocities in the Greek War of Independence—against four centuries of Ottoman rule—in which Byron had perished of disease while bringing aid to the Greeks. “Scenes from the Massacre at Chios” (1824) and “Greece on the Ruins of Missolonghi” (1826) are, well, romanticized. Delacroix came closest to realism in North Africa—“Women of Algiers in Their Apartment” (1834) is a serene, strikingly dignified depiction of a harem—where he travelled with a diplomatic mission following France’s conquest of Algeria. He then mined the associations for whoop-de-doo fantasies of Arabian warfare: cultural booty of imperialism. But the horses! Like movie stars, they register as at once archetypal and particular—obliging but slightly aloof in their violent roles. Art’s transformation, in nineteenth-century Paris, was left to Corot, Courbet, and, climactically, Manet, with his “The Luncheon on the Grass” and “Olympia” in the year of Delacroix’s death, 1863."],["inline-embed",{"type":"callout","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22callout%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22feature-small%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22image%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522image%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%2522%252Fphotos%252F5ba52ac08688f82d6d666522%2522%252C%2522width%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522height%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522caption%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%225ba52ac08688f82d6d666522%5C%22%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%22%2C%22attrs%22%3A%7B%7D%7D","ref":""},["inline-embed",{"type":"image","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22image%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22%2Fphotos%2F5ba52ac08688f82d6d666522%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":"5ba52ac08688f82d6d666522"}]],["p","Delacroix was a boffo performer in paint, bent on annual dominance at Paris’s Beaux-Arts Salon from his first sensational entry there, “The Barque of Dante,” in 1822, until 1863, with “Ovid Among the Scythians” (which he’d painted in 1859). He was at no pains to conceal the influence of Venetian and Flemish Old Masters—Veronese and Tintoretto in particular, but Rubens more than any other. The results often suggest incredibly exalted fan fiction. The Met show ends with “Lion Hunt” (1855), a vast painting, based on precedents by Rubens, that was damaged in a fire, in 1870, which left only the bottom two-thirds of it intact, and small workings of the complete scene. A frontal, tumultuous scrum of two big cats, three horses, and five Arabian hunters threatens to burst from the canvas. Claws, hooves, teeth, and scimitars contend. Primary colors blaze. Black resounds. It’s a dazzling picture, but Delacroix’s open competition with Rubens, who was denied a riposte by virtue of being two centuries deceased, gives it the air of an elephantine bagatelle. It advertises what Delacroix can do, pending something worth doing. I expect honest disagreement here from other art lovers, who may find a frolic in the painterly surf exhilarating. But I have trouble with artists—Rubens very much included—who seem driven mainly to be admired."],["inline-embed",{"type":"callout","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22callout%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22feature-small%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22image%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522image%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%2522%252Fphotos%252F5ba52ac01df9042d67b79613%2522%252C%2522width%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522height%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522caption%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%225ba52ac01df9042d67b79613%5C%22%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%22%2C%22attrs%22%3A%7B%7D%7D","ref":""},["inline-embed",{"type":"image","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22image%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22%2Fphotos%2F5ba52ac01df9042d67b79613%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":"5ba52ac01df9042d67b79613"}]],["p","A special problem for me is that Delacroix was the beau ideal of painting for Charles Baudelaire, who is my beau ideal of art criticism. The poet saw things in the artist that are hard to detect now. “Delacroix, lake of blood, haunted by evil angels,” he wrote while tortuously relating Delacroix’s achievement to that of his other idol, Edgar Allan Poe. What happens there, I think, is that Baudelaire distills a fugitive, dark essence from Delacroix’s Romanticism as he did from that of Poe, shrugging off the artistic limitations of both to furnish a poetry of emotional candor and formal discipline beyond their reach. Delacroix didn’t get it. He said that Baudelaire got on his nerves. Cushioned by literary and exotic conceits, he couldn’t—or wouldn’t—comprehend the psychic and social ordeals, and the surprising pleasures, that Baudelaire was the first to term “modernity.” But there may still have been hope for him in his last years, when he was pointed toward an integrally decorative and narrative style by the example of younger artists, notably Puvis de Chavannes."],["inline-embed",{"type":"callout","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22callout%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22feature-small%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22image%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522image%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%2522%252Fphotos%252F5ba52ac03c34cb10249644ef%2522%252C%2522width%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522height%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522caption%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%225ba52ac03c34cb10249644ef%5C%22%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%22%2C%22attrs%22%3A%7B%7D%7D","ref":""},["inline-embed",{"type":"image","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22image%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22%2Fphotos%2F5ba52ac03c34cb10249644ef%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":"5ba52ac03c34cb10249644ef"}]],["p","I was delighted to find, in a wall text, Baudelaire’s comment on the painting that I had already decided I liked best in the show: “Ovid Among the Scythians,” a composition of small figures in a deep landscape of meadow, water, and mountains. The exiled Roman poet is attended to by kindly barbarians. A dusky, bluish tonality suffuses the scene, which is discreetly accented with bits of bold color. The picture breathes. It offers numerous points of interest: Delacroix backing off, for once, to let us decide where to look. Baudelaire wrote, referring to Ovid, “Just as exile gave the brilliant poet that quality of sadness which he had hitherto lacked, so melancholy has clothed the painter’s superabundant landscape.” He added, “The mind sinks into it with a slow and appreciative rapture.” Mine certainly did. But notice that the painting would go slack without its largest character: in the foreground, a sturdy mare looking back with mild forbearance at a man who is milking her."],["p","Individual animals may display something like personality. But none have personas: the masks, constituting society, that we consciously or unconsciously devise to convey some aspects of our selves and to hide others. Romanticism of every sort delves inward. It endorses feelings, of which the deepest are instincts. That depth is what Delacroix’s four-legged creatures bring to his art. He really looked at them, as he didn’t at humans. His people generally seem cast from clichés to enact artificial, often preposterous scripts. He shocked the Salon in 1838 with a painting of Medea, dagger in hand, about to murder her children—an act that you’d think would encourage concentration, but, as the babes squirm in her arms, she gazes to the side as if distracted by a leaky faucet. She’s absurd, like Sardanapalus or even, in Delacroix’s spectacular but jejune religious paintings, Jesus. But consider “Young Tiger Playing with Its Mother” (1830), dead-on true to feline nature and possessed of qualities that you might think of anthropomorphizing—as “proud,” say, or “noble”—but for which words thrillingly fail. ♦"]]],"canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"sections":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"},"slug":"magazine","children":[{"id":"590a11e68b51cf59fc42475c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"590a11e68b51cf59fc42475c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"The Art World","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"the-art-world"},{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"},{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"}],"name":"The Art World","parent":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"},"slug":"the-art-world"}]}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"magazine","contentTags":[],"contentType":"article","contributors":[{"name":"Peter Schjeldahl","type":"author","title":"Peter Schjeldahl has been a staff writer at \u003cem&gt;The New Yorker\u003c/em&gt; since 1998 and is the magazine’s art critic.

They’re doing a very good job,” Trump said, with a shrug. He added, referring to the possibility that Ford would appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee this week, “Look, if she shows up, and makes a credible showing, that will be very interesting, and we’ll have to make a decision.” By “we,” Trump meant “I,” and his comment pointed to one aspect of the ugly shambles of the Kavanaugh nomination which is beyond dispute. In a few years’—if not a few weeks’—time, there will be another set of confirmation hearings. There always is, and each is shaped by the previous one, as the parties refight the latest war on a new plain of legal writings and personal backgrounds."],["p","Such contentiousness, though, is not the same as wisdom gained. Twenty-seven years after Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee lacerated ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/anita-hill"},"Anita Hill"],", and then voted to confirm ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/clarence-thomas"},"Clarence Thomas"],", who she said had sexually harassed her when he was her boss, the committee clearly has not yet figured out how it should deal with issues that fall under the broad umbrella of ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/metoo"},"#MeToo"],". But neither have the two parties figured out how to deal with the issue of Donald Trump, a volatile bigot who expects his Attorney General to solve his multifarious legal problems, and who, some fear, may expect his Supreme Court appointees to do the same."],["p","“Look, when I first decided to run, everybody said the single most important thing you do is the Supreme Court Justice,” Trump said on Wednesday. The election gave him that power, with the help of a slim Republican majority in the Senate. That is part of the tragedy of 2016, and the Kavanaugh hearings have served as a sour reminder of it. Then again, the midterms are just a month and a half away. Senator ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/lindsey-graham"},"Lindsey Graham"],", Republican of South Carolina, succinctly expressed G.O.P. concerns about November last week, saying that the calls for the F.B.I. to investigate Ford’s allegations are “not about finding the truth, but delaying the process till after the midterm elections.”"],["p","The truth matters more than the midterms, but Graham’s charge, which Trump echoed in furious tweets on Friday, raises a useful question. Do the Democrats have a post-midterm Supreme Court game plan? They need to reckon, first, with the possibility that they will not like the election results. If Kavanaugh is not confirmed, Trump will likely let out a long wail of aggrievement, urging his base to send him more loyal senators. And, come November, the base might deliver."],["p","If so, there is little reason to hope that a post-midterm Republican majority—one more indebted to Trump—would do better than the current one, which sped through the first part of the Kavanaugh hearings. The Republicans ignored not only his extreme views on issues such as executive power, gun control, and reproductive rights but his obfuscations, if not outright lies, to the committee. While the Republicans treated these substantive problems with an unseemly indifference, the Democrats, for their part, wasted some time and credibility with grandstanding forays. President Trump may think that the senators are doing “a very good job,” but they themselves can’t honestly think so."],["p","A number of recent factors have pushed the process to its current state. First came the dishonorable treatment of ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/barack-obama"},"Barack Obama"],"’s nominee ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/merrick-garland"},"Merrick Garland"],", whom ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/mitch-mcconnell"},"Mitch McConnell"],", the Senate Majority Leader, refused to grant even a hearing, leaving a seat open for more than a year, and ultimately for Trump to fill. Then, to get Trump’s first nominee, ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/neil-gorsuch"},"Neil Gorsuch"],", confirmed, McConnell engineered the end of the filibuster to oppose Supreme Court nominations—the number of votes needed to confirm, in a practical sense, dropped from sixty to fifty-one, making moderate nominees less relevant. Both acts have in common an overriding circumstance: the willingness of the G.O.P. to defer to Trump. The midterms, again, may only make that worse."],["p","But there is a chance that the Democrats will take the Senate; that’s why Graham and his colleagues are so worried. What would the Democrats do then? One option would be to keep a Court seat open for the next two years, or the next six, if Trump is reëlected. But, if what was done to Garland was dirty and wrong—and it was—that is all the more reason for the Democrats not to emulate it. And, while they might energize their own base, it could mean losing what’s left of the middle, and of the Court’s legitimacy. They need a better strategy than mimicking Mitch McConnell."],["p","Rejecting as many untenable or extreme nominees as Trump comes up with, though—taking them one at a time, giving each a fair, open-minded hearing—would make sense in a way that blind delay does not. If Kavanaugh’s confirmation fails, no one should expect that Trump’s next pick would be entitled to a seat. After Robert Bork’s nomination was defeated, in 1987, largely on the basis of his extreme jurisprudence, ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/ronald-reagan"},"Ronald Reagan"],"’s next choice, Douglas Ginsburg, withdrew after reports of his marijuana use emerged. That opened the door for Anthony Kennedy, who, as it happened, was worth holding out for. It also took Richard Nixon three tries to come up with a confirmable replacement for Abe Fortas, before succeeding with Harry Blackmun, the Justice who wrote the decision in Roe v. Wade. The Democrats need to win such fights in a manner that is consistent with their principles and their identity. To do that, they will need to clearly define themselves, an exercise that can only help them with the task they must achieve if they really want the job of shaping the courts: winning elections. ♦"]]],"canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"sections":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"},"slug":"magazine","children":[{"id":"592dfa44d5fda942c34a0b61","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"592dfa44d5fda942c34a0b61","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Comment","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"comment"},{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"},{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"}],"name":"Comment","parent":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"},"slug":"comment"}]}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"magazine","contentTags":[{"name":"Brett Kavanaugh","url":"/tag/brett-kavanaugh"},{"name":"Supreme Court","url":"/tag/supreme-court"},{"name":"Confirmation Hearings","url":"/tag/confirmation-hearings"},{"name":"Sexual Assault","url":"/tag/sexual-assault"},{"name":"Christine Blasey Ford","url":"/tag/christine-blasey-ford"}],"contentType":"article","contributors":[{"name":"Amy Davidson Sorkin","type":"author","title":"Amy Davidson Sorkin, a \u003cem&gt;New Yorker\u003c/em&gt; staff writer, is a regular contributor to Comment for the magazine and writes a Web \u003ca href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson\"&gt;column\u003c/a&gt;, in which she covers war, sports, and everything in between.","email":"","bio":["div",["p","Amy Davidson Sorkin became a staff writer in 2014.

question that Michael Moore sets out to answer in his new documentary, “Fahrenheit 11/9,” is a simple one. He poses it in his trademark voice-over—a companionable croon, surprisingly soft, as if he were sitting next to us at a bar and cradling a beer. The question, complete with dramatic pauses, runs as follows: “How. The fuck.

The soil from which he bloomed was richly dunged."],["p","The first cause, according to Moore, is Gwen Stefani. Once Trump learned that she was paid more handsomely for “The Voice” than he was for “The Apprentice,” he flexed his celebrity muscles by pretending to be Presidential material. The pretense stuck. This explanation—that Trump was somehow mortified into political ambition—is oddly persuasive, though other commentators have traced it, no less plausibly, to Barack Obama’s lampooning of him at the White House Correspondents’ Association Dinner, in 2011, and the psychology behind the claim is nothing new.

The look on his face contains “a vague hope of the most terrible revenge,” and the author adds, in an unforgettable aside, “It is doubtless to such moments of humiliation that we owe men like Robespierre.”"],["p","So, what else allowed Trump’s revolution to take root? Moore, like other despairing souls, rails against the Electoral College, and also against what he views as the Democratic Party’s undemocratic scorn for the preferences of its own members at the county level. But the movie is most effective when it gets its hands dirty, and wet, by delving into a scandal in Flint, Michigan—Moore’s birthplace, and the setting for “",["a",{"href":"https://www.amazon.com/Roger-Me-Michael-Moore/dp/B002PYM4C6/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1537802760&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=Roger+%26+Me"},"Roger &amp; Me"],"” (1989), the movie that put him on the map. Back then, his theme was the laying off of workers at General Motors, and, specifically, the dark deeds of the G.M. chairman, Roger Smith. Now Moore turns his attention to Rick Snyder, the governor of Michigan, and to the polluting of Flint’s public water supply during his tenure. Drinking water has been poisoned with lead, and Moore presents us with weeping children and other victims: the oldest trick in the book, for any documentarian, though it still carries emotional clout."],["p","Unchanged, too, is Moore’s habit of strewing his argument with stunts—marching toward Snyder’s office with handcuffs, say, in a bid to make a citizen’s arrest, or parking a truck full of Flint water outside the governor’s mansion and gleefully hosing the front lawn. These days, however, such gambits seem a touch weary and fruitless, and the movie is burdened by a larger problem. What, exactly, has the cautionary tale from Michigan got to do with Trump? Well, for Moore, it’s a blueprint: one rich guy’s knack for befouling the neighborhood foretells another’s ability to mess up the land of the free. Not that we have a chance to ponder the logic of that link, for the movie is already darting off in another direction and proposing its next analogy: if you’re wondering where America’s current craze for discourtesy, outrage, and scapegoating might lead, look to nineteen-thirties Germany. For anybody who doesn’t quite get the point, Moore hammers it home like a tent peg. We are offered footage of a Nuremberg rally, with the Führer’s ululations replaced by those of Donald Trump."],["p","As a rule, once Hitler is slipped into any conversation, it’s time to back away and pour yourself a drink, but Moore’s jeremiads are as contagious as ever, and you feel the eagerness—at once amused and horrified—with which he lays out the parallels between the Nazi era and ours. He’s in distinguished company; Luis Buñuel, in his memoirs, recalls that, near the start of the Second World War, an abridged version of Leni Riefenstahl’s “Triumph of the Will” was shown in New York to two great comic directors, Chaplin and René Clair. Responses were mixed. Clair was appalled, Buñuel says, but Chaplin laughed, “once so hard that he actually fell off his chair.”"],["p","“Fahrenheit 11/9,” too, is a barrel of laughs, not because it’s particularly funny but because the barrel is packed with people laughing, mostly for reasons that make you squirm. We watch George Stephanopoulos and his guests, on ABC, cackle at the preposterous notion that Trump might ever become President; we hear friendly giggles as Leslie Moonves, asked about the wave of interest in Trump, admits that “it may not be good for America but it’s darn good for CBS”; and we see a clip of Trump being asked, on a talk show, what he has in common with his daughter Ivanka and replying, “I was going to say ‘sex,’ ” before being smothered by shrieks of nervous delight from the audience. Notice that all of these scenes come from television, the hot bright boudoir where entertainment and governance make out. And people still profess to be amazed that a TV host could end up as the Commander-in-Chief."],["p","As for solving the crisis, Michael Moore has a revelation up his sleeve. “Let me share with you a fact that has never been stated in the press, or reported on the nightly news, or even spoken amongst ourselves,” he declares, with a conjurer’s flourish. And the big reveal? “The United States of America is a leftist country.” Various items of evidence are submitted as proof: statistics on health care and welfare; demonstrations in favor of gun control organized in February by survivors of the Parkland school shootings; and, in the same month, the successful strike that was called by teachers in West Virginia. All that is required for the dislodging of the status quo is a natural gush of political complaint, or so the movie would have us believe. What it neglects to mention is that, in the 2016 election, Michigan went for Trump, who was also backed by a startling 68.5 per cent of West Virginian voters. The gushers had ideas of their own."],["p","“Fahrenheit 11/9” is saddened, irate, and scattershot, edited with snap and crackle by Doug Abel and Pablo Proenza, and stirred by Moore’s rueful awareness that, in an emergency, the call to action should override the pleasures of irreverence. More hunting, less snark. But the film will neither change minds nor soothe embittered hearts, I fear, and an opportunity has been missed. Flint is to Moore as Baltimore is to Barry Levinson or Brooklyn to Spike Lee, and I can’t help wishing that Moore, who knows every inch of his home turf, had embedded with a family of Trump loyalists—not to catch them out, as he seeks to do with Snyder, or to stand in awe of them, as he does with the Parkland students, but purely to trace the source of the family’s grievances and the everyday progress of its hopes. After all, he did much the same with autoworkers in “Roger &amp; Me.” That movie, incidentally, earned praise from an unexpected quarter. “I liked it,” Donald Trump once said, before adding, “I hope he never does one on me.”"]],["inline-embed",{"type":"section","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22section%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cp%3EGiven%20that%20Colette%2C%20the%20French%20novelist%20who%20lived%20at%20full%20pelt%20and%20died%20in%201954%2C%20was%20prized%20for%20the%20feline%20opulence%20of%20her%20prose%20and%20for%20the%20unclipped%20sharpness%20of%20her%20social%20claws%2C%20it%20seems%20only%20fitting%20that%20a%20film%20about%20her%20should%20begin%20with%20a%20cat%20on%20a%20bed.%20%E2%80%9CColette%2C%E2%80%9D%20directed%20by%20Wash%20Westmoreland%2C%20stars%20Keira%20Knightley%20in%20the%20title%20role%3B%20Dominic%20West%20as%20her%20first%20husband%3B%20Fiona%20Shaw%20as%20her%20mother%3B%20and%20Denise%20Gough%2C%20dashingly%20dressed%20in%20men%E2%80%99s%20clothes%2C%20as%20Missy%2C%20one%20of%20Colette%E2%80%99s%20many%20female%20lovers.%20There%20is%20also%20a%20thoughtful%20French%20bulldog%2C%20played%20by%20an%20actor%20named%20Life.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EIf%20you%20like%20your%20costume%20dramas%20to%20come%20with%20bulky%20chronological%20signposts%2C%20%E2%80%9CColette%E2%80%9D%20will%20leave%20you%20in%20raptures.%20%E2%80%9CEiffel%20Tower%3A%20for%20or%20against%3F%E2%80%9D%20one%20character%20inquires%2C%20while%20another%2C%20receiving%20guests%20at%20her%20Parisian%20home%2C%20boasts%20of%20her%20first%20electric%20light%3A%20%E2%80%9COn%E2%80%94off!%E2%80%9D%20And%2C%20if%20you%20don%E2%80%99t%20know%20Colette%E2%80%99s%20private%20history%2C%20get%20ready%3A%20is%20there%20a%20more%20bewitching%20parable%20of%20enslavement%20and%20revenge%3F%20Plucked%20from%20the%20provinces%2C%20she%20is%20married%20at%20twenty%20to%20Henry%20Gauthier-Villars%2C%20or%20Willy%2C%20a%20well-known%20author%E2%80%94or%2C%20rather%2C%20a%20shameless%20literary%20entrepreneur%E2%80%94who%20locks%20her%20in%20a%20room%2C%20four%20hours%20at%20a%20stretch%2C%20and%20forces%20her%20to%20write%20the%20fiction%20that%20he%20then%20passes%20off%20as%20his%20own.%20The%20cad!%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EThe%20legend%20of%20Colette%2C%20in%20brief%2C%20is%20one%20of%20those%20rare%20real-life%20dramas%20that%20arrive%20at%20melodrama%20without%20assistance.%20A%20photograph%20of%20her%20on%20a%20mobile%20peacock%20throne%2C%20borne%20aloft%20by%20four%20near-naked%20men%2C%20appears%20in%20%E2%80%9CSecrets%20of%20the%20Flesh%2C%E2%80%9D%20Judith%20Thurman%E2%80%99s%20thorough%20biography%20of%201999%2C%20so%20it%E2%80%99s%20no%20stretch%20when%20a%20similar%20tableau%20is%20inserted%20into%20the%20movie.%20Knightley%20and%20West%20leap%20without%20a%20qualm%20into%20these%20excesses%2C%20not%20least%20the%20Feydeau-like%20saga%20of%20a%20flame-haired%20Louisiana%20heiress%20(Eleanor%20Tomlinson)%2C%20who%20sleeps%20with%20both%20Willy%20%3Cem%3Eand%3C%2Fem%3E%20his%20wife%2C%20unbeknownst%20to%20her%2C%20though%20he%20beknew%20everything.%20Colette%2C%20it%20is%20worth%20remembering%2C%20wrote%20almost%20eighty%20books%2C%20and%20Westmoreland%E2%80%99s%20film%20revives%20a%20pressing%20question%3A%20How.%20The%20fuck.%20Did%20she%20find%20the%20time%3F%C2%A0%E2%99%A6%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%22%7D","ref":""},["p","Given that Colette, the French novelist who lived at full pelt and died in 1954, was prized for the feline opulence of her prose and for the unclipped sharpness of her social claws, it seems only fitting that a film about her should begin with a cat on a bed. “Colette,” directed by Wash Westmoreland, stars Keira Knightley in the title role; Dominic West as her first husband; Fiona Shaw as her mother; and Denise Gough, dashingly dressed in men’s clothes, as Missy, one of Colette’s many female lovers. There is also a thoughtful French bulldog, played by an actor named Life."],["p","If you like your costume dramas to come with bulky chronological signposts, “Colette” will leave you in raptures. “Eiffel Tower: for or against?” one character inquires, while another, receiving guests at her Parisian home, boasts of her first electric light: “On—off!” And, if you don’t know Colette’s private history, get ready: is there a more bewitching parable of enslavement and revenge? Plucked from the provinces, she is married at twenty to Henry Gauthier-Villars, or Willy, a well-known author—or, rather, a shameless literary entrepreneur—who locks her in a room, four hours at a stretch, and forces her to write the fiction that he then passes off as his own. The cad!"],["p","The legend of Colette, in brief, is one of those rare real-life dramas that arrive at melodrama without assistance. A photograph of her on a mobile peacock throne, borne aloft by four near-naked men, appears in “Secrets of the Flesh,” Judith Thurman’s thorough biography of 1999, so it’s no stretch when a similar tableau is inserted into the movie. Knightley and West leap without a qualm into these excesses, not least the Feydeau-like saga of a flame-haired Louisiana heiress (Eleanor Tomlinson), who sleeps with both Willy ",["em","and"]," his wife, unbeknownst to her, though he beknew everything.
